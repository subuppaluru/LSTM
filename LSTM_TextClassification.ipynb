XXXX XXXX XXXX began reporting late pays on both my wife 's and my credit reports for the difference between the payoff provided thru XX/XX/XXXX and when they deposited the payoff check on XX/XX/XXXX. These late pays continued through XXXX of XXXX. We only aware of this in accuracy the week of XX/XX/XXXX when working to make a major purchase. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX actions are unacceptable based on their internal processing of the check. We should not have been penalized/reported late on our credit reports. This has significantly damaged our credit rating to the point that we are now unable to obtain a loan on our pending purchase. We have attempted to resolve the matter with XXXX XXXX XXXX to no avail thus far. We continue to receive stall and deflect actions from them.

The CRA 's have only made a portion of the corrections to our accounts and left other incorrection information in place.
