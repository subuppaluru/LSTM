Vehicle loan or lease,"I contacted Ally on Friday XX/XX/XXXX after falling behind on payments due to being out of work for a short period of time due to an illness. I chated with a representative after logging into my account regarding my opitions to ensure I protect my credit and bring my account current. 

She advised me that before an extenstion could be done, I had to make a payment in the amount of {$270.00}. I reviewed my finances, as I am playing catch up on all my bills and made this payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. This rep advised me, once this payment posts to my account to contact Ally back for an extention or to have a payment deffered to the end of my loan. 

With this in mind, I contacted Ally again today and chatted with XXXX. I explained all of the above and the information I was provided when I chatted with the rep last week. She asked several questions and advised me that a one or two month  extension/deffered payment could be done however partial payment is needed! WHAT? She advised me {$230.00} or there abouts would be due within 10 days from me accepting the agreement and then the remaining bal of {$150.00} or there abouts would be due in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my payments of {$380.00} per month would resume. 

If this was the case, I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN OFFERED THIS WHEN I JUST MADE MY PAYMENT so that I could catch up on my bills. 

This company was working with XXXX in New Jersey which has since closed most likely due to illegal practices, they changed my loan company to this company after I had signed paperwork for another, kill you with interest rates and has NEVER once considered refiancing my vechile for a lower interest rate ( due to the age of the vechile other companies will not take it ) and THEY DO NOT WORK WITH YOU!"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello This complaint is against the three credit reporting companies. XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX. I noticed some discrepencies on my credit report so I put a credit freeze with XXXX.on XX/XX/2019. I then notified the three credit agencies previously stated with a writtent letter dated XX/XX/2019 requesting them to verifiy certain accounts showing on my report They were a Bankruptcy and a bank account from XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
The response from XXXX and XXXX  was that it was verified through their third partner XXXX. That can not be correct because I have a Freeze on my XXXX XXXX account since XX/XX/XXXX. which no one can obtain my report for anything until I unfreeze it. 
I wrote XXXX and XXXX a second letter and mailed them on XX/XX/2019 telling them that they have lied when they said that they verified the two accounts in question using XXXX because I have a freeze on my account and when I called XXXX on XX/XX/2019 they stated that no one has requested or attempted access to my account this year. I told them that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. Only XXXX wrote back a letter dated XX/XX/2019 stating that XXXX verified the accounts and that I should talk to them if I have a complaint. 

Trans Union never responded to my letter dated XX/XX/2019 to verifiy the two accounts in question since and the 30 plus days to investigate my claim has been expired. When I Checked my Credit report with TransUnion, It states that they too uses XXXX to verify the two accounts in question. I also wrote them a second letter and mailed it on XX/XX/2019 stating that they are in violation of my consumer rights and demand that these two accounts be removed from my report immediately. 

Please investigate these compnaies because what they are doing is wrong. They are using a third party that gives wrong information and attach it to your account and then tell you to fight them to get it corrected. No I dont have to fight because XXXX, XXXX and Trans union all lied and said that XXXX verified and account which is impossible because my account with them is FROZEN and no one can access it but I. I demand that these items on my account that was not verified be removed from my account because they are in violation of my rights and not to mention, Trans union did not even respond to my investigation request."

The original loan was with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. We refinanced the loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) in XXXX Texas. XXXX called XXXX XXXX XXXX and received a payoff of the loan good till XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX issued a check in the full amount provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX did not submit the check from XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX per XXXX records. XXXX XXXX XXXX began reporting late pays on both my wife 's and my credit reports for the difference between the payoff provided thru XX/XX/XXXX and when they deposited the payoff check on XX/XX/XXXX. These late pays continued through XXXX of XXXX. We only aware of this in accuracy the week of XX/XX/XXXX when working to make a major purchase. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX actions are unacceptable based on their internal processing of the check. We should not have been penalized/reported late on our credit reports. This has significantly damaged our credit rating to the point that we are now unable to obtain a loan on our pending purchase. We have attempted to resolve the matter with XXXX XXXX XXXX to no avail thus far. We continue to receive stall and deflect actions from them. We now at the point of losing our option on the purchase we were attempting. Based on information provided by XXXX, the payoff amount check was issued and mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX 8 days prior to the payoff date provided of XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX should not have reported to our credit reports due to their inability to process payments in a timely manner. 

The issue above was resolved with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to correct all incorrect reporting from the furnisher ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) in XXXX of this year. We received a letter from the Office of the President that outlined the steps they would take to correct the wrong reporting. ( Attached ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent to all three Credit Reporting Agencies ( CRA ) XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX the correct information to be updated and reported on our accounts. The CRA 's were to remove any and all derogatory comments related to the XXXX XXXX XXXX trades, payment history, payment status, all late payments, any reference to charge off and/or settlement. In addition we were refunded two checks from XXXX XXXX XXXX for the charges that were incorrectly billed to us in addition to the above. The CRA 's have only made a portion of the corrections to our accounts and left other incorrection information in place. If fact, some of the initial changes that they made, they have changed back to derogatory 30 days after the corrections were made. This has caused my credit score to drop 47 points as of XXXX."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","In an attempt to purchase concert tickets, I communicated with an internet seller. He gave his name, email address and phone number and via a phone conversation, explained that he felt more secure using XXXX  through his bank account. He sent a screenshot with a confirmation that tickets had been transferred to my friend with all relevant personal information and pickup information confirmed - it looks legitimate. 

I initiated the transfer through XXXX via my Chase Banking app, presuming that I was protected by Chase Fraud services if the transaction were to go sour. If I was transferring money from within my Chase account, SURELY Chase services would still protect me, right? No ... .I was wrong. I confirmed the transaction and followed the seller 's instructions for ticket pickup, however the tickets were not there as promised, and when I tried to contact the seller, he of course was unresponsive. Nowhere in the XXXX  payment initiation process does it prompt you to confirm that the transfer is NOT protected by the normal Chase fraud protection, again, despite the fact that it is literally embedded in the bank account. It's incredibly, and intentionally, unclear and misleading. The entire point of using this tool was to avoid something like XXXX, which in retrospect, is exactly the same thing. 

I presume his information is also fraudulent however here it is : Name : XXXX XXXX Email Address : XXXX Phone Number : XXXX Bank : XXXX Method of Transfer : XXXX  ( Chase to XXXX ) Amount : {$750.00}"
Mortgage,"I am attempting to sell my home and pay off my home loan with PHH Mortgage. PHH has been awful to work with. I attempted to obtain a pay off several times on their website, which does not work and I advised them it does not work. My attorney, under my authorization has contacted them several times over the previous several weeks and has been unable to obtain a pay off amount.

Vehicle loan or lease,"We are writing this letter to dispute a delinquent payment reported for XX/XX/2018 under our GM Financial account. 
Our account was set up for autopay and we were unaware that the autopay had an expiration date. 
According to customer service, the autopay ended XX/XX/2018 so our XX/XX/2018 payment was delinquent. 
We use autopay for many accounts and the autopay is usually continuous for the life of the loan/account. 
We explained to their customer service department that we didnt receive any notices that our autopay was going to be ending soon or that it needed to be renewed. They said that they dont provide these types of notifications because it is the customer who sets up the autopay. 
We also explained to their customer service department that we never received any phone calls that we were past due on any payments. They explained that the collections department tried to contact one of the numbers on file and was told not to call that number again. On further review of the loan application, it appears they reached out to my husbands HR department at work which he placed on the lease application to verify employment. They said that eventhough they didnt try to reach out to our cellphones, they are not required to even call us. The call they made to my husbands HR department was just a courtesy call. 
We would like to file a complaint against GM Financial as we do not feel GM Financial notified us appropriately before reporting a delinquency to the credit agencies. We feel that GM Financial should have either notified us that our autopay would be ending soon or that the autopay had ended. We also feel that GM financial should have called our cellphones not our HR department to reach us."
Mortgage,"I am writing to inform you of the unfortunate set of circumstances that lead to my home loan ending up in a foreclosure.. I was laid off in XXXX. I called XXXX  XXXX XXXX immediately after I was given the news that I was laid off.. I was concern for I was never late and I wonder if there was a program or any type of help that could help out until I found a job and make the new income adjustment work. I will never forget how this day has changed my life. 
I spoke to a customer service to a gentleman by the name of XXXX XXXX was very accommodating. He went on to tell me that there was nothing to worry about because the government had just signed "" bailout money "" for borrowers like me. He mentioned that in order to qualify for 2 % modification all I had to do was to miss three payments. I went home and told my husband and he was very reluctant. I went on and miss the payments. I did not hear anything from the bank for months. Shortly after I received a forbearance letter asking for all the money that I had missed. 
After paying the three payment on trial period the modification disappeared. The two subsequent payments were never found. I applied for a modification again four times. All documentation was sent in. I was denied four times with out an explanation. My marriage ended because all the stress. 
Since XXXX  XXXX XXXX advised me to skip my mortgage payments, they quickly transferred the loan to XXXX and then to Shell point. I feel I was defrauded by my bank. I am also victim of predatory lending. I must comment that XXXX  XXXX XXXX rewarded employees for denying applications and referring customers to foreclosure, according to the statement. A collector by the name of XXXX said who placed ten or more accounts into foreclosure in a given month received {$500.00} bonus. Other rewards included Gift cards retail stores or restaurants, said XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 
Who worked as a collector from XXXX to XXXX. 
original publication XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX This loan was based on stated income and had apparently an inflated appraisal. 
I I am requesting the wet ink note be provided. Signature appears to be forged. 
I have done a forensic review. 
I also want an explanation about my note and mortgage which is owned by XXXX XXXX. 
Please explain to me how XXXX XXXX can maintain that they own the note if Shell point also is claiming ownership .I need this matter resolved."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I was initially contacted by XXXX XXXX in Fall 2016. Equitable Acceptance has partnership with XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX. These corporations are scam companies "" dealers '' for Equitable Acceptance. XXXX XXXX XXXX calls individuals and present a con/scam that they can enroll students in a special student loan repayment program. These corporations inform students that they qualify for loan forgiveness program and much lower monthly payments to their lenders ; which would ensure less payment out of student 's pocket and more loan being paid off/forgiven by the government. These corporations inform that the offer is only provided through their enrollment and the program enrollment will be ending soon. These corporations charge a fee for this service, in my case it was {$1800.00} in monthly direct debit amount of {$30.00} from my bank account. But these corporations convince students this is a great deal compared to how much they will save you from paying back to loan lender. Once an individual agrees to enroll in their scam program, they are connected to Equitable Acceptance to set up payment plan for their {$1800.00} document processing fee etc. Unfortunately, I fell for their scam. The documents are actually available FREE on department of education website, that students can complete themselves for no charge. These corporations were submitting false documents on my behalf indicating that my annual income is lower than it actually is. I never qualified for any of the programs that would result in student loans being forgiven. It only ended up costing me {$1800.00} and additional length on my student loan re-pay since they enrolled me in extremely low payback program. I want these evil scammers taking advantage of vulnerable students to stand trial for their crimes and be incarcerated. This scam needs to stop! I don't expect to see my {$1800.00} again as they are a fraudulent ponzi-scheme company. But I don't want them to continue in business getting rich off poor working students and ripping of Department of Education at same time if they continue enrolling individuals in re-payment programs that they don't qualify for."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have numerous inquiries on my credit report that I never authorized. I paid for Experian membership and can’t review my credit report. The inquiries are from companies i have not seek credit from. Experian refuses to take identity thief seriously. It’s bad enough they have let a collection agency stay on my credit report without really investigating.

Mortgage,"We are experiencing wrongful foreclosure proceedings by Home Point Financial - haven't missed a payment with the exception of an approved forbearance period of 3 months. Funds from a FHA Disaster Partial Claim Modification ( to pay for  forebereance months ) have yet to been applied a year after signing documents. 

After Hurricane Irma ( XX/XX/XXXX ), Home Point Financial ( our mortgage bank ) offered a 3-month forbearance ( for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). In XX/XX/XXXX, we continued with our monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted paperwork for an approved FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification that would cover payment for forbearance months + XX/XX/XXXX ( while the modification was setup and took place ) in the amount of {$10000.00}. We were instructed to resume payments in XX/XX/XXXX, and we have sent our monthly payment without failure to this date. 

However, as of today XX/XX/XXXX ( a year after we submitted documentation for the FHA Disaster Partial Claim modification ), the funds have not been applied to the account. In the bank system, we appear delinquent to the amount that equals this modification and regardless of our multiple attempts to call attention to the bank to review this anomaly, we have been told that their system is correct and that we must pay in full that amount. 

We sent a letter* dated XX/XX/XXXX to several offices of Home Point in multiple states with copies of all checks proof of our  regular payments. Should the FHA modification funds were applied, we would not be delinquent. We doubt they read our letter. On phone call in XX/XX/XXXX we were told that because of our delinquency our account was sent to legal department to initiate foreclosure proceedings. *letter attached to this claim. 

Checks with mortgage payments for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were returned ; we sent XXXX 's payment but won't be surprised that is also returned. At the moment our delinquency totals 7 months : 4 months covered by the FHA modification + XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. We have placed the funds for the returned checks aside so that when the bank starts accepting payments again, we will be able to submit. 

For months we have received calls from debt collectors, and experienced dismissives from multiple bank associates and managers - because in their records their files are accurate. They don't seem to realize the FHA modification funds are missing! 

We need help locating the FHA modification funds and having them properly accounted towards our account so that we can bring our loan account current, and stop the wrongful foreclosure proceedings."
Mortgage,"My original mortgage at closing was about {$1800.00} I paid this amount for one ( 1 ) year. This included insurance and property taxes.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a shock! The mortgage company neglected to put in the MUD taxes in the note resulting in a $ XX/XX/XXXX increase in payments. This was a deceptive practice because being a retired police officer, I would not have purchased this home. I called everyone to ask why wasn't this amount put into the closing documents when my payment was estimated. No one knows the answer. It seems that I'm in this municipal district in addition to my property taxes. How in the world can that happen. anyway in order not to lose my home, I borrowed the money off my credit card and paid the taxes on the house directly. I then asked the mortgage company to adjust my escrow for this year.

Now they are threatening me with foreclosure. When I sent in my payment of {$1800.00}, they applied it to the escrow without my permission. I have sent the mortgage payment the same way for the past year but in order to continue this unfair tactic, they applied it to escrow. I guess they make a lot of money off interest in escrow. Now they want {$4000.00} f0r the mortgage payment. I need them to adjust the escrow so I can pay the mortgage."

Debt collection,"In XXXX, I started receiving mail and phone calls from LVNV Funding about a debt from XXXX XXXX for {$1000.00}. I disputed this information several times in writing telling them I dont owe this debt and to send me verification or delete this information off my credit report. LVNV keep sending me a bill as valid reason for them to report this fraudulent information on my credit report. In XXXX I starting receiving more calls and mail about this debt, this time it was Resurgent Capital Services, telling me I need to pay them because it was in pre legal status and I am getting sued. They called several times a day, interrupting me while I was at work. I disputed with them as well but received mail correspondence from LVNV with yet another bill as verification. In XX/XX/XXXX, I started to receive mail and calls from now XXXX XXXX XXXX about this same debt. I have been getting harnessed by LVNV and its related companies for months about a debt that isnt mine. LVNV couldnt provide me with a contract with a signature like I requested so I am being attacked by 3 different companies about the same debt that is hurting my credit file and coasting me additional money. On XX/XX/XXXX, I decide to call Resurgent and resolve this debt because of the damage it is doing to my credit. I explained to the representative that this wasnt my debt however I wish to resolve it. I asked about a settlement and they offered 20 %, I said that was too much. The representative pulled my credit without my permission and told me I could afford it and quoted every credit card as well as my children names off my credit report. She told me my credit lines and who I was an authorized user on what card and everything. I dont feel its fair that LVNV Funding is allowed to report fraudulent unverified information on my credit file. I dont feel that LVNV Funding should be allowed to harass me through all of their different companies for the same debt. I dont feel as the representative had a right to access my credit file without my permission and tell me that I can afford to pay a debt that I told her I wasnt capable of paying in full. I was treated very badly and I feel my privacy has been invaded."

I am concerned with the way they identified me. They asked questions that anyone could answer. Of course because someone used the info to add the extended.

I asked her to verify my calling me or texting. I feel safer and its a good tool. I was told they are unable to do that.

Equifax is part of the problem and if they dont cooperate ; what can I do? Submit a complaint to CFPB in which they never acknowledge any of my complaints.

Equifax needs to change their policies to ensure there are extra steps of getting a consumer verified other than asking questions, that someone has from ID theft.

The entire waste of time, without any resolution, and still locked out.

How do I get around this which, should not be difficult in the first place and what reasons are they unable to send a code to our phones and we verify.

The only option they offer, is an email to click a link and emails do not always get delivered quick. I was told to wait an hour, I accept that.

Why would they not take extra secure measures to verify my identity? It is already been established ; someone submitted a copy of my social security, proof of address, and other documents they require for an extended. Am I the XX/XX/XXXX consumer who finds many holes in this process that does nothing for protecting and verifying my identity.

Lastly, if you require further information, how do you communicate with the person filing a complaint? Is there a portal or account options so consumers may have access to reports submitted?

Mortgage,"We have spoken with several agents of Real Time Resolutions ( RTR ) in regards to the above mentioned mortgage debt being only serviced on behalf of XXXX. ( XXXX ) In response to notices received from RTR dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, we are requesting that these omissions of RTR having received either Notice of Assignment, Sale or Transfer of servicing rights of the loan to be definitely defined per statutes of Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ), the Fair Debt collections Act ( FDCPA ), as well as the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) .RTR was served with a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) on XXXX XXXX, XXXX and they have failed to properly respond to our demands under RESPA , FDCPA and FCRA. They have failed to indicate and establish proper ownership and rights to service the loan. Furthermore, they have failed to provide an itemized accounting ledger of crediting payments made, late fees, etc. from multiple alleged prior servicers of the loan. The assignments, sale affidavits, allonge ( s ) to the note and loan transfers documentation is incomplete and inconsistent with proper mortgage securities and we feel that we are victims of mortgage securitization fraud on many levels, riddled with an array of abusive deceptive practices and misrepresentation.XXXX of RTR, signed an alleged executed agreement with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) dated XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. By RTR 's own omissions they did not take over servicing rights to the loan until XXXX XXXX, XXXX from XXXX. We have also taken this matter a step further and contacted XXXX County land records here in Texas, and there is no record of assignments for this loan which support or remotely indicate that RTR nor XXXX carry legitimate custodial servicing rights or ownership to this loan. In fact, it appears as though XXXX, still owns the loan which is impossible, because they filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX and all securities liquidated. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" A '' -Collection Agreement Forgery ) According to land records, the loan was originated with XXXX . From there, it was transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX was shut down, following XXXX XXXX filing bankruptcy XXXX XXXX, XXXX. So how is it possible that there was any such agreement made with XXXX and RTR? The answer is. it 's not possible.It appears that the agent of RTR, named XXXX XXXX, is in fact a Robo-signer ; since the alleged agreement according to RTR was signed and dated XXXX, XXXX XXXX ; long after the collapse of XXXX. The milestones report that was provided from RTR is dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The report documents a span from XXXX XXXX, XXXX until XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; indicating custodial service rights transfers for XXXX, XXXX, and even XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) .The problem as previously addressed, is that XXXX dissolved in XXXX, XXXX XXXX Chapter XXXX in XXXX, all securities sold off, and XXXX is prohibited from participating in any consumer loan in the capacity of owner servicer or any such activities as of XXXX. As far as we are able to tell, the milestone report has been falsified. ( SEE EXHIBIT "" B '' -- XXXX XXXX ) RTR, has also failed to provide evidence of documentation detailing updated assignments of ownership or necessary proof of their custodial servicing obligations. Furthermore, per RESPA and the FDCPA surrounding mortgage debt validation, we are demanding a complete chain of title as well as the Allonge to the Note, sale affidavits and evidence transfer from XXXX to XXXX and XXXX to XXXX, and finally XXXX to RTR. ( including all accounting ledgers from each servicer previously listed as well. ) In particular, there are a multitude of concerns about the facts surrounding Case # XXXX XXXX which involves CEO XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), engaging in a number of unlawful lending practices and abusive collection practices."
Checking or savings account,"I made a purchase from XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX bundle on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with an agent online to verify that XXXX XXXX would price match the item, and the agent confirmed that they would price match the sale as long as the order was placed 24 hours after XXXX XXXX was over. The sale price to be matched was from XXXX for XXXX for two controllers, the console and one game ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I placed the order and picked the item up on the XXXX. I did not receive a receipt for the item because the purchase was made online, according to the XXXX XXXX employee. I did not receive a receipt from XXXX XXXX online either, and they have been unable to provide me with a receipt. I checked my checking account information a few days later and noticed that I was charged {$470.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Chase and informed them of the issue and they issued me a temporary credit. The issue was resolved until XX/XX/XXXX, when XXXX XXXX sent a receipt to Chase, and Chase recharged my card. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and requested an explanation and they informed me that they would not honor the price match because they have a new policy that they don't price match bundles ( which was not mentioned when I spoke to XXXX XXXX in XXXX ).  XXXX XXXX would also not match any part of the price because the item return/exchange date is XX/XX/XXXX, so they are unable to assist in any way. I have screenshots of the sale price and a transcript of the conversation with the agent that said they would indeed price match the item if I ordered it online.

There have been no new accounts or dealings with any company associated with XXXX XXXX. I should not have these items on my credit report any longer. I have sent in copies of my bankruptcy discharge papers as well as proof of my address and how long I've lived there. This has all been to no avail. I have asked several times to be provided with any data they have so that I may file an identity theft report if someone has in fact utilized my information without my consent. To date they have provided nothing. They continue to snd back computer generated letters stating the debts have been verified but according to the Federal Credit Reporting Act this is false. That to me seems unlawful. Therefore I filed a complaint with CFPB previously. You, too were unable to resolve this matter with Transunion. This is against the law. I have contacted this XXXX XXXX company over 30 times. They admit to having received my bankruptcy notification. Then when I ask to speak to a supervisor to assist in communicating this to Transunion, I am transferred around and mysteriously hung up on. This is all absurd and I will be filing lawsuit and complaint with the federal court with regard to the bankruptcy laws being violated within the next few days."

And I was told by Chase this card would as well. It even stated that in their online advertising at the time I applied This is a matter of principle even more than this fee If Chase told me the 1st year fee would NOT be waved, I would never have requested this card Chase obviously shows little concern for their customers.

I tried to call them a few week after the filing when I could no longer access my account online.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I contacted Bank of America Visa to get help in an ongoing issue. It started last month at the same time on XX/XX/XXXX where I was notified that 5 charges were made in the amount of {$15.00} via XXXX. I contested charges last month and I was told by BOA Credit Card Services ( BOA CC ) that by closing my credit card ( CC ) account then the issue was resolved. They failed to tell me that they would still allow the carryover of charges ( even disputed ones ) to our new CC ( BOA failed to expedite the new CC despite our request and it took approximately one week to get a new CC ). We have numerous automatic charges so it took approximately 2 hours of my time to convert those charges to the new credit card received a week later ( New CC ). A month later the same 5 contested charges appeared on the New CC. We called XXXX  who agreed to block the charges and confirmed that these contested charges were automatically transferred by BOA. Each charge was for XXXX- apparently BOA had done NOTHING to block these charges in XX/XX/XXXX- instead they failed to tell us it was up to us to contact XXXX   to block and instead just transferred the charges despite this being the sole reason our CC was closed in XX/XX/XXXX. Because the New CC number was NOT compromised- there was no reason to do more than to dispute the charges. We contacted BOA as XXXX advised we had to do and explained the situation. As explicitly discussed during the call on XX/XX/2019, the instruction was not to cancel the new number as it had NOT been compromised. We were merely disputing the charges. However, we requested reimbursement of the approximately 80.00 in disputed charges. Our call was elevated to a supervisor named XXXX XXXX in the Rhode Island CC service center who was rude and abusive on the call resulting in escalated conversations. Throughout these conversations I was explicitly clear that I would NOT be closing the New CC and Ms. XXXX confirmed this fact including at the end of the call. Ms XXXX began to raise her voice as I repeatedly asked to ask a question but her demeanor changed rapidly and she because rude and condescending as she continued. Ultimately, I was able to tell her that I dont want to fight her but that we take care of this directly with XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat those monies myself so that this wouldnt be a fraud alert because after all, my new card was never compromised. I advised that I would contact XXXX and that if I had to then I would eat the monies myself so that my New CC remain intact- as the new card was never compromised. Regardless, I was shocked by her behavior and contacted BOA to lodge a complaint into Ms. XXXX temperament and rudeness. Hours later it is abundantly clear that Ms. XXXX went back into the account and closed it. This was clearly in retaliation for the complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter. This was clearly in retaliation for my complaint. Further, it appears that she failed to even dispute the charges at the center of this matter.The individual taking the complaint was a good kind agent named XXXX  who advised me that this was actually a billing dispute and not a fraud alert and that she would dispute the charges referenced above. After this was completed, XXXX filed my complaint against Ms. XXXX. Approx. 4 hours later I received a panic call from XXXX. Ms XXXX  had done the unthinkable. She cancelled my New CC despite 1 ). the card itself not being compromised and 2 ). my explicit instruction not to cancel it and affirmation of this instruction by Ms. XXXX. Obviously Ms. XXXX  went ( unauthorized by me ) BACK into my New CC account and cancelled the card. The timing is very suspicious as it occurred shortly after my report of horrific customer service. Further, BOA failed to timely notify us that it had cancelled our New CC- and sitting here today, I do not know : 1 ). why it was closed despite the facts above ; 2 ). effective date of closure ; 3 ). if BOA is honoring our dispute of the XXXX charges ( not apparent in the online information ).

This violates regulatory rules and ethics rules. We did not authorize the closing of the New CC nor did we authorize a disgruntled customer service supervisor the authority to go back into our credit card account and to take action. Please investigated and take action against BOA and Ms. XXXX."

I was entered into an agreement with a company called Equitable Acceptance who has been charging me $ XXXX/month for the past 18 months. To date, I have paid this company {$880.00} and still have an outstanding balance of {$910.00} which means I will end up paying this company {$1800.00} for document preparation services to consolidate my student loans. I was unaware that I would be charged this massive fee, had I known, I would not have engaged in any agreement that would cost over {$1800.00}.

Mortgage,"I have discussed several accounting discrepancies with SPS but SPS has refused to make corrections to my account. SPS statements they mailed to me indicates that I owe XXXX XXXX dollars ( XXXX ) for property taxes, which is not true but they refused to tell me how they derived at that number. There are also charges that show XXXX charges for inspections with no details as to why, especially since I was not in foreclosure. I sent SPS a payment history to show that the billing was incorrect however they refused to stop the Auction of my home scheduled for XX/XX/2019. I filed a Notice of Error on XX/XX/2019 they have ignored the notice, even though they have opened an inquiry for research. They indicated they did not have to stop it because of the RESPA regulations did not apply to Dual Tracking for this incident. The notice of error stated numerous accounting errors by SPS, over charges and other erroneous charges from companies that I do not know that are on the SPS statement of charges sent out by the previous servicer and SPS. 

I also was charged for numerous inspections charges for my home when my home was not in foreclosure. I was charged BPO charges and legal fees when my account was in a current status. I am not sure of what the charges are that are on my account and why, but I asked that SPS give  an accounting to why they continued to charge those incorrect amounts to my mortgage account when I have indicated they were incorrect many times. They are currently ignoring my request. I requested that SPS review my account and make corrections to my interest and my principle, they have refused to this date to do that. 
SPS on XX/XX/XXXX received a QWR they have refused to respond to my request, they indicated they will respond to it after my home is auctioned off which does not make a lot of sense to me. SPS has given erroneous information about the status of my account, I was told by several managers especially one that opened the research to verify the accounting errors on my account that the auction of my home would be postponed until that happened. Of course that was lies. I have requested several call backs from supervisor in the department of the Ombudsman and litigations no one will return the call. I requested that other executives in SPS ( any department ) return the call and address my inquiries and there has been no response, no call back and no evidence that they are willing to allow a workout plan. This has been blatant bullying and harassment from SPS with refusal to discuss with me the status of my account. 

The interest on my account is incorrect because of the erroneous charges therefore the principle is incorrect I have as for a pay-off and settlement which they withdrew which was a breach of the prior agreement in place. I have charges on my account for forced place insurance that need to be corrected and adjusted on my account."

Debt collection,"I had 2 accounts with XXXX XXXX that were over drawn and sent to collection. It took me some time, but eventually I settled on both debts. I and family members continue to receive phone calls about the debts from numerous agencies. The most recent agency is calling from XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. It took me approximately 2 weeks of 20 or so calls to actually reach someone on the other end of the line. Most times they would pick up and hang up almost immediately, or leave me on hold. The voicemail they have set up has been full each time I have called and not gotten through on hold. Today when speaking with them, the woman continually asked for me to provide the XXXX XXXX  account information. I declined and requested they provide an email address or fax for me to send the documentation I have to show the debts are paid. She disconnected the call. After I called back, she advised that she would not entertain it and she was filing the paperwork to the court and again hung up on me. As you can see from my documents, I have settled both debts."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/2018, I financed a new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I got the loan thru BBVA. I set up online automatic withdrawal. I had problems setting it up online. So I tried over the phone. I was told I had everything set up online and all accounts, charges, settings were set. 
Well, after the first month, I started getting late notices on payments in XXXX 2018. I called and doubled checked my online account. Everything looked normal and already set up. On the phone, the representative would go over my account and said all was fine, it must be a glitch. And submit a work ticket. I never heard anything back.

Then 2-3 weeks later, I would get more mail stating I was failing to make regular monthly payments on my loan to BBVA. 
I once again, called and talked to a representative over the phone. Same thing. They said it was taken care of. 
In XX/XX/2018, I finally went into a local BBVA bank and said I wanted to speak to someone in charge and find out why my payments were not being submitted and why the auto withdrawal was not going thru. After 5 days, it was finally straightened out. BBVA apparently had the wrong account number from my bank. I had submitted it correctly, but they kept entering one too many digits. 
However, it is because of 2-3 months of NONE payments, I believe my credit history has suffered. I have a score of XXXX, as of XXXX-18. I believe this to be unfair since it was not my error back in XX/XX/2018, when BBVA made the mistake on my loan account. I wish for this to be corrected, reviewed and addressed. Since the correction, I have been late on NO accounts and fully pay all loans and bills on time with no past due or collection agencies."

Neither are true and she lied about a letter being sent to me. XXXX wrote a letter that was basically a lie. She called to inform me she was taking the case and hung up! Nothing else was said or asked.

Debt collection,"I once had a XXXX XXXX Credit card Which I used very little. Suddenly in XX/XX/2018 the card increased to over {$70000.00} and I had not done it. It was interesting that the card limit was {$15000.00} but was well over that. I contacted the company which had been bought out by XXXX and they could or would not give me any explanation. The statement showed multiple payments on the card but then within about 5 days reversed the payment. I did not make the purchases and even IF I had what happened to the credit limit of {$15000.00}. 
WE have tried talking to the new owners of the account ( Midland Credit Management ) and again nothing we say seems to register with them. We sent them a letter disputing the whole thing and just now we received a notice that they are "" uncertain of what we are specifically disputing ''. I thought our letter was very clear as to what! For one thing I didn't make the purchase, the second ; the banks that the payments were made from I do not know and have not had accounts there. The only way I can see it getting to the {$86000.00} they are claiming is if there has been fraud on their part."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Based on the fact that the credit bureaus ignored my numerous requests to provide documentary proof that they used to verify the disputed accounts, which means that they have not verified or they can not verify any of these accounts. They failed to identify the name of a responsible person in the company who verified the accuracy of these accounts. Besides, they have not submitted evidence of the investigation, reinvestigation ( method of verification ) by giving me names and addresses of persons contacted, nor they have removed anything found inaccurate."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have contacted XXXX  and TransUnion multiple times since XX/XX/2019.

XXXX refunded late fees and interest to my account so that the balance was {$0.00}. XXXX  and TransUnion will not change the status from Past Due to current even though I have provided statements showing the refunded fees. XXXX said the account is up to date in their system and not past due for XX/XX/2019. Their recommendation was to dispute with the agencies which I have done multiple times. I dont understand why XXXX  updated the report and the others refuse. My credit score dropped significantly because of this. So much so I was advised against putting an offer on a house until it was resolved and now the house is no longer on the market!

I was told by a representative that once I make the XXXX payment, which was behind, that they would send me the deferment paperwork and the two payments would be deferred with no fees to be paid up front since this was a hardship. I paid and never received the paperwork. I called in XXXX and they told me it had to be in before the end of XXXX. I explained I had never received it. I was then told that I had to qualify again. They told me once more that I was approved and no fees would be added. I received the paperwork, signed and emailed back the same day. Last week, I noticed that the due date online still showed as XXXX. I called and was told the extension couldnt be processed because I had to pay {$180.00} in fees up front. I told them that I was told I didnt have to pay that and that it would be waived by management due to the circumstances. The representative I spoke with said she did see those notes on my account and that she would let the deferment department know to go ahead and process the extension. I then get an email today from a XXXX XXXX with the lender and the email is stating again that the extension cant be processed without a {$50.00} fee.

I informed them in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not owe the cooperative any money, and XXXX stated in XX/XX/XXXX that they would not get ( see  attachment ) involved with any dispute between myself and the cooperative as the money alleged by the cooperative to be owing at the time was more than what was owed to XXXX. Furthermore one of  the loans was paid off in XXXX ( see XXXX XXXX issued by XXXX -attachment ).

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","1st Complaint In reference to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Collection Agency ) correspondence dated XX/XX/XXXX. Please be advised that I would like to officially file a complaint against Synchrony ( lender ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the improper handling of my account with XXXX XXXX issued by Synchrony ending in XXXX. 

on XX/XX/XXXX I applied for an XXXX XXXX Credit Card at their store in XXXX, NC. Since the date I submitted the application I never received any statements or any type of correspondence until XX/XX/XXXX when I harassed by a collection agency about an outstanding debt that transferred to collection. I had to contact the XXXX on the card and they confirmed the status of the account and by way of conversation I found out that I owed {$34.00} from the date of application that accrued interest and late fees of {$140.00}, but more importantly damaging my credit history due to the negligence on XXXX XXXX as well Synchrony Part. They didnt have a good address for me therefore I never received any correspondence. They told me on the phone they tried to contact me via email which obviously was captured by spam therefore I never received a monthly statement or any other method of notification of a payment due. 


2nd complaint Privacy breach. 

For a whole year my info has been sent to someone somewhere which comes with the risk of identity theft. It seems like that is not a one off situation since I was mailed a JC Penny statement in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY XXXX."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XXXX I opened an account with Synchrony Bank to finance flooring for my home through XXXX XXXX. I signed up for a 12 month interest free promotion. I paid the account off in XX/XX/XXXX, prior to the interest being due and on XX/XX/XXXX I received an email stating that I have a XXXX balance. I never used the card again and I was even issued a refund in the amount of {$47.00} for overpayment, which is expected since I paid more than the balance on the statement to avoid any interest. 
After a couple of months I started to get phone calls from Synchrony Bank stating that I have a balance outstanding in the amount of {$47.00}. I spoke to several representatives over the course of almost a year and I had lengthy conversations along with lengthy wait times while the representatives tried to figure out what the problem was. I received a number of excuses, none of which made any sense and when I asked for my issue to be escalated I never received a call back. Now this {$47.00} erroneous charge has resulted in an over {$200.00} charge and erroneous late payments on my credit report. I disputed the late charges with the credit bureau and Synchrony still refused to correct their error and update my credit history. 
As I have explained to the representatives if I owed this amount I would have no problem paying it, just as I have paid them over {$4000.00} for my flooring over the past year. But no one could even tell me where the charge came from or why they would issue me a refund check in the same amount that they are telling me that I owe. Was the refund check a scam to get me to initiate new credit with them? Or was this Synchrony 's way of making me pay additional since I got an interest free credit card, per their promotion? I need some answers and most importantly I need my credit report corrected since I pay Synchrony and all of my other creditors on time.

To add more insult to injury, Synchrony has sent this account to a collection agency which will further harm my credit standing for their error. 
I have documentation that I would like to attach to this complaint if possible. 
Thank you for your time."

I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community.

Student loan,During a time of financial hardship I fell behind and was unable to make student loan payments. During this time I received several threatening phone calls from a company servicing my federal student loans called XXXX investment corp . Representatives at the company were demanding that I pay the entire lump sum of the loan amount. During several harassing phone calls representatives threatened to send my loan to a law office that will garnish my wages unless I made a payment of {$50000.00} over the phone. I was unsure who this company was and they were unable to confirm details of the accounts. Income based payment options were not made available. Excessive fees and high interest have also been added to my loan balance.

Student loan,"Starting in XX/XX/2019, I was so far ahead in my monthly payments that I was allowed to stop making payments for a few months. I received a summary of my accounts with this information monthly, with the date of when payments would need to start again. 
So in XXXX and XX/XX/2019, I stopped automatic deduction from my checking account. Each month, I paid a large chunk of money on one specific loan in an effort to pay it off. I successfully paid in full one loan in XXXX, and received a "" Paid In Full '' letter in the mail a few days later. My plan was to, each month, make a payment for one specific loan to pay it off, and by the time my paid ahead staus was finished, I should have 3 loans paid off. 
However, on XX/XX/2019, I received correspondence that my loan terms changed, and suddenly I was mandated to make payments again starting this month. When I called for further clarification on XX/XX/2019, the customer service representative informed me that my paid ahead status was canceled PER MY REQUEST. I assured her that I had not made that request ; in fact, I had not spoken to anyone at fedloan in months. The representative shared with me that the important information that should have been documented in my account, such as the identification number of the representative who made such change, was missing. This is alarming to me, that someone at fedloan made changes to my account WITHOUT MY CONSENT. This is the reason for my complaint. 
The representative did submit a request to reinstate my paid ahead status ; however, this will take time to process. In the interim, I have to make the mandated payments for XXXX, and possibly XXXX, and my plan to have 3 loans completely paid off by spring is no more. I am angrier, however, that someone at fedloan made changes to my account WITHOUT MY CONSENT."

Debt collection,"Hello, On XX/XX/XXXX a collection ( total of 5 ) was placed on my XXXX  credit report by Harvard Collections. I found out on XX/XX/XXXX when I obtained my free reports. I was appalled as this is the 3rd agency that has tried to get the {$100.00} total from me. I have also received calls in the past from various collection agencies as well as postal mail on and off. I feel sick and angry all over again as I thought this ongoing issue was over and done with. To continue, I was never an inpatient anywhere in XX/XX/XXXX therefore the date is incorrect. I was however a patient in XX/XX/XXXX but my story and my truth remain the same. The first delinquency dates are incorrect as well-all 5, the charges were bogus and I confirmed this with a Medicare rep, in addition they waited 2 years to bill and all medical facilities know that they have 1 year to bill Medicare. I have copies of all the letters that I mailed to the first 2 collection agencies. I also have my notes regarding my call to Medicare and the rep that I spoke with as well as other notes, Medicare statements etc ... I hope something can finally be done now to stop these lying, harassing people and agencies etc ... they're relentless and it's very unfair and unjustified to ruin a persons credit with bogus charges. I hope the 5 collections will be removed from my reports as soon as possible as my credit reports are good and very important to me. I forgot to add that when this started I NEVER received any bills regarding the charges-just straight to collection and the first collection notice that I received was XX/XX/XXXX and the charges weren't on my Medicare statements either which I also confirmed with a Medicare rep. These agencies have also sent mail to relatives solely based on our surnames-sent to addresses that I have never resided at. Thank you very much."

Credit card or prepaid card,"My wife was on a business trip that I accompanied her on to Northern Ca. We stayed the night before in XXXX XXXX, Ca., in one room and used our Citi Card. We made reservations the next night online for the XXXX XXXX, when we arrived, we were given only one choice of an upstairs room that was available, difficult being a senior and lugging suitcases, but we took the room, enjoyed 1 night there and check out in the morning. We've called the Hotel to dispute and they have a booking service that made duplicate reservations. As you can see one of them is the wrong spelling of our name. Regardless, we checked into and used 1 room, it's obvious we wouldn't have needed 3 rooms and if we had 3, why weren't we given options on check in? I've taken this up with CIti and they are absolutely no help, they just send an inquiry and then charge you. 

This is the second time I've had an issue with Citi Card on a fraudulent charge, last time they did not remove the charge and now it's happening again. Long time card holder, excellent credit score, Veteran and would appreciate any help with this."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I contacted the company today regarding the loan. I have been paying XXXX twice a month since XX/XX/XXXX. I attempted to log on to my account to check the balance and review my contract. I am aware of the high interest rate of the loan but felt I had payed too much for the loan. When I tried to logon to my account access was denied. I emailed the company regarding this matter today and was advised I owed 2 more payments due on XX/XX/XXXX. One for a missed payment which I was unaware of any missed payments. I was told account information was not available at this time online. I was advised by email when I opened the account that I would have access at all times to this information. I requested a copy of my contract today Im the email and no response was given to this request. If they can not provide me a copy of my contract or interest I have been charged then how can this be a legal contract. I realize part is my fault for being desperate and dumb at the time. I printed a copy of the contact at the time but have moved since then and had misplaced it. They identify themselves on their website as a tribal lender in Montana. I am not sure exactly how much the loan was for again at the time I was desperate. I feel that withholding documents is not legal and I should be reimbursed the interest I have paid them at the very least. Now I am not even sure this was a legal lender.
Mortgage,"To Whom It May Concern, My lender ( Chase ) issued me a short sale approval letter today and it expires on XX/XX/2019. This is ridiculous. There is no way that the buyers lender will be able to adhere to the TRID Guidelines. 1 ). The lender has to have 3 days to get the disclosure out to the Buyer 2 ). The Buyers Underwriter has to review and 3 ). Underwriter conditions would have to be cleared prior to closing. So, there is a reason that the TRID laws state that a lender has 45 days to close. I NEED HELP!!! The Short Sale Lender only approved the short sale for 4 days, which is unheard of. The are not only being unreasonable, but they also are not in compliance with the TRID Laws. I have done everything that i can to get this to happen, but if the lender refuses to cooperate, then i have no choice but to get you involved. Please help me."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX XXXX listed multiple 30 and 60 day late payment on my credit report from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This information is incorrect and negatively affecting my credit report. This is reporting on XXXX and XXXX. Please remove the 30/60 day late  payments from my credit reports.
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/19 I made a deposit in the amount of {$500.00} to a suntrust ATM located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL XXXX. In the middle of the transaction the ATM malfunctioned and restarted. I immediately called into the customer service line to make sure my deposit went through ( time of call at XXXX Saturday XX/XX/XXXX ). I spoke with a representative that let me know that the deposit did in fact go through. I asked if I needed to take any further action and was informed that I did not. 

On Sunday XX/XX/XXXX I was auditing my account and noticed that the deposit for XX/XX/XXXX was not reflecting on my account. As it was a Sunday I waited until XX/XX/19 at XXXX to call in to customer service and speak with someone about my lost deposit. A claim representative let me know that he saw a deposit was attempted but it did not ultimately go through. I was told that I would have to wait for an investigation to be completed but a temporary credit could be applied to my account in 10 business days. I expressed my concerns about having to wait 2 weeks to have access to my money due to a malfunction with their equipment and was not offered any solution to that. 

XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX I went in to the branch where the transaction took place. I asked if the branch had access to the ATM camera and was informed that they did not as they do not service the ATM themselves. I asked if the temporary credit could be expedited, a representative called the disputes line and was informed that we would not be able to do so. It was brought to my attention by the representative that their power went out 3 times over the last month. I was told that I would have to wait for a count to occur and see if they have surplus cash. 

At this time I am not confident that Suntrust will give me access to my deposit. Furthermore, if I hadn't noticed that my deposit hadn't posted they would have kept my money. The ATM didn't give me a receipt ( turned off in the middle of my transaction ), I don't have access to the video from the ATM, I don't have access to the calls I made and the counters could just lie about having surplus cash."

Mortgage,"I started a loan with with Ethos Lending ( XXXX XXXX, Ca ) on XX/XX/18 and had given them all of the information they requested and my credit scores were excellent that they used from a credit report done XXXX. Then two days before my signing date on XX/XX/XXXX, ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) they told me I would be charged a 1.099 % fee because my credit scores had dropped ( three credit agencies ) from XXXX to XXXX. I told them it was a mistake and when I called the credit agencies they told me it was because of a XXXX $ XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX bill that was unpaid. So I called XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and found out it was not my primary bill, but a secondary bill from another property and they had sent it to the wrong address, not my current address they send my other bills. XXXX XXXXXXXX sent a letter out ( which they never do ) to all three credit agencies to negate this late report. Within 15 days my credit scores all rose 80 points to back over 740.  Well I signed the paperwork in the mean time and when I went back to Ethos they said they wouldn't rebate me the fees.. 
First I think when they first ran my report to see the excellent scores and approved my loan they shouldn't be able to change that and charge me {$4900.00} two days before I sign the paperwork, just to hit me up with another charge. 
And secondly when I show they the low ratings were wrong ( shown by the letter from XXXX saying to delete this report to all three credit agencies ) and then two weeks later all three scores rose to their normally high scores they should refund me the {$4900.00} charge because the ratings were false reports ... .. 
Ethos said they would explore this but just said well tough.."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I went into Check into Cash to obtain a loan that I had been to before. 
The following month, I noticed that the company did a hard credit check / inquiry. I contacted them and they informed me that they started doing them the month I came in. I explained that I was not told at the time I was in, nor was there any information regarding this in the store. They told me to call corporate. 
I called corporate, and they told me that they indeed did start doing them the month I came in. They also stated that there should have been placards in the store mentioning this and that it was in the fine print of what I had signed. I told them that there were no placards relative to this in the store and that I was not told of this change. They again, referred to the mention of it in the fine print. 
I had read near all of the extremely lengthy contract in the past before there was this change. Had I known or had they told me or had the placard up for me to read, I would have opted for another business nearby to do business with. This was explained, but they simply have no interest in my credit, the impact this has caused, or the desire to remove the inquiry that I did not authorize and was not made aware of them doing should I do business with them. I know in the end, it's the consumer 's responsibility to read everything. But, like I had said, I did previously. It should be their responsibility to inform clients of any changes or addendums they make. 
I simply want this inquiry removed. It not only impacted my credit score, but looks bad having done business with this type of company to future creditors."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I filed a proper dispute about XXXX XXXX XXXX with Experian with account number XXXX and contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX with a dispute with request for Validation on this unknown account. I sent certified mail to XXXX XXXX XXXX twice on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to VALIDATE which they never response to this unknown account. XXXX properly investigated and deleted off my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. Experian refusal to properly investigate or properly mark this account as in dispute as is in  violation FCRA and FACTA. I included a copy of this unknown account being deleted off my XXXX   credit report and a copy certified mail to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Experian concluded that the monthly payment and balance is accurate and verified when I did dispute. Clearly its incorrect because a auto car loan can not have a monthly payment of {$0.00}. They verified that the balance of {$15000.00} is accurate. They also verified that I pay {$8000.00} on this account on XX/XX/XXXX. So if I paid {$8000.00} on this account why is the balance is {$15000.00} when Experian verified that {$20000.00} was written off? Which under FCRA is inaccurate and must be DELETED because the balance and monthly payment is is reporting inaccurately. FCRA states to put on a Consumer report everything must be 100 % accurate and correct!!!
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have asked TransUnion to correct my name several times as I am not known by the last name of XXXX. I was married on XX/XX/XXXX and my last name is XXXX. I have also asked Trans Union to provide me with proof I authorized the inquiries on my account. Most recently, they responded with a letter sent to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. My credit report shows my name as aka XXXX XXXX XXXX! This makes it difficult to receive mail because XXXX XXXX is no longer my legal name. I have forwarded my marriage license and updated drivers license but they still refuse to update my file."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is my second complaint in only 1 day against TransUnion. I had 36 mistakes just this year in my file with TransUnion and I called so many times, they regularary hung up on me because they don't care. 

This time is that on XX/XX/XXXX, finally my score went up 69 points because I paid my credit cards. I did not know, being immigrant from XXXX, that in the USA, you should not spend more than 20 % of the amount of your credit cards limit. What's the point - it is so stupid. If you have an emergency, let 's say the dentist, you pay with your credit card, and it was not enough to be in pain because of a tooth, that you need to lose point from your credit score. - Where is the logic. 

In any event, I increased 69 points, but on XX/XX/2019, I lost 79 points for no reason that I can see, I did not spend on credit cards, I did not have a new debts. I called a supervisor in the USA, he did not give me his name, he told me that the reason is that I had two ACCOUNTS, yes two ACCOUNTS and they were merged and my score decreased of 79 points. I was fuming, how it is possible to have two accounts, it's not a bank account, it's my credit score linked with what? my Social Security Number. And as everyone else I have only one SSN.

He told me that, of course, there's nothing else to do and he put an end at the conversation and hung up.

If it's the case, that means that TransUnion only as Reporting Agency merged my XXXX Social Security Number with the USA ones. This is not acceptable, both countries has different laws and Credit Bureaus in XXXX are not important at all, certainly not like in the USA. By law in XXXX, our SSN can not be disclose easily, so if TransUnion used my SSN from XXXX, they are in an illegal position with XXXX. There's always a disclosure in XXXX on that card saying that this number and card belong exclusively to the Government. In any event, XXXX and USA are two different countries and totally two different court systems and different laws. Again it is only TransUnion who does that kind of thing, always trying to destyroy someone aggressively, but always pretending to report only."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I had a leased vehicle Honda provided a payoff for. I paid the amount to purchase a new car. I received harassing calls and letters threatening repossession of my XXXX XXXX which had been turned in to the dealer months prior. Credit report shows amount owed and have been sent to various collections. When disputed previously Honda denied and provided bogus payment history saying amount owed and repossession never sought. The vehicle I did purchase XX/XX/XXXX claim never addressed. That vehicle was repossessed after payment was never applied that had been sent in. Also car was given to repo man at XXXX when car was in garage and he had gone in to verify. I did not know at the time that was not allowed. He threatened I would need to be in court the next morning if I did not give him the car and it would cost additional thousands in court fees. Also said a key fee of {$500.00} would also be charged. I was getting paid in the next 2 days and was going to make my payments I did not know were over 30 days since a payment had never been properly applied. I was told I could get my car back once I made my payment and called Honda. This has caused extreme hardship and affected my ability to find a job since credit checks are a part. Also has created a hardship in securing housing for the same reason.Had I not been lied to I would have retained my vehicle my good standing credit wise and not had to go through undue hardships otherwise. Honda has profited by unduly doing this and continues to seek payments through collection. 

I have copy of payoff, and payment made. Copy of letters threatening repossession which they denied for XX/XX/XXXX. I also have a copy of check sent in which was not applied that resulted in XX/XX/XXXX being late. Also proof of XX/XX/XXXX car picked up from dealer when transferred to another lot in XX/XX/XXXX despite being threatened in XX/XX/XXXX with repossession and charge off."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2019 I received several calls at work and to my cell phone from someone stating the doll listen very carefully this call Is to the resident to attempt will be made to deliver a certified summons to ( last name ) for  further information contact the issuing attorneys office handling the matter immediately at XXXX This was left on my cell phone and my office phone. The receptionist at my job also told me that this person needed to give me an official summons, he told my job. Not cool. Then made several attempts to call the receptionist to reach me again. I called the number and began to ask questions of why I was being sued, who was or what this was all about. He stated because I owe a company XXXX. He began to insult me and call me XXXX  for not knowing there was interest on the fees. Using words like XXXX and XXXX  youre a XXXX XXXX how XXXX  I was and know wonder why I joined the XXXX and lost us the war. Insult after insult and laughed at me. After asking how can I fix this and if I can make payments he began to say that he was going to record me as not willing to pay and being uncooperative and then proceeded to hang hang up on me. After researching this, between insults he did give me info. I found out that XXXX XXXX XXXX  is behind this. The number in my voicemail is saying they are a law firm. When I call XXXX They answer the with the name of some law firm. However the person in charge of my account wouldnt not repeat the name to allow me to write it down. I tried to reach someone else and they defended the behavior of this guy insulting me and deemed it okay to threaten with suing me because I couldnt afford XXXX dollars. I do not owe this money and they are trying to get more from me than what is on my credit report."
Checking or savings account,"I received a settlement check from a wrongful death suit involving my mother and the approximate total of the check was {$130000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. According to the Wells Fargo bank statement of XX/XX/XXXX, a deposit, of {$130000.00} was made into my Wells Fargo Access Fifty checking account. I spoke with a Financial Counselor representative at the bank that asked how did I come to have such a large check. I explained about the settlement. I only wanted to put that money in my personal checking account. I was told that I needed to open a savings overdraft protection account to avoid monthly fees and charges. I believed that was a separate account. This money was never deposited or linked to the overdraft savings account. Both accounts were online banking accounts of which I did not have access to a computer ; therefore, I was unable to check the accounts. No paper statements were sent to me. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$36000.00} was made. I did not withdraw this money. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of {$75000.00} was made. I did not withdraw this money. On XXXX XXXX, a withdrawal made in a Branch/store of XXXX was made. I did not withdraw this money. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I was inquiring about a line of credit with Wells Fargo. The bank manager said I had to have a substantial amount of money in the bank for a line of credit. I said I do. She asked what account? I told her it was in my overdraft account. She said, What money in an overdraft account? I told her I put money in an overdraft saving account in XXXX. She said that their bank records do not go back that far, their retention period is only 7 years. However, she began to find and printed out an access fifty checking bank statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX. It verified a check totaling {$130000.00} was deposited on XXXX XXXX. Its showed a withdrawal of {$36000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, {$75000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$2500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank manager found several other accounts in my name of which I never opened or even knew about. I requested to see a signature page or signature of the withdrawal slip for those withdrawals. The bank manager said that information was not available since they only keep 7 years worth of information. I requested an investigation. She notified an escalation team of Wells Fargo. This team called me back in 5 days- they stated the retention policy was only 7 years and she could only find a bank statement starting with XX/XX/XXXX and no further information was available. I believe since the money can not be found or accounted for -identity theft, multiple accounts and a merger between Wachovia and Wells Fargo and Overdraft Protection Account, hid the removal of these monies."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a joint account with my partner who filed chapter XXXX bankruptcy. I did not. I have been paying faithfully on the account since it was opened. I never missed a payment and have never had a late payment. MB Financial is reporting on my credit reports that the account is closed/charged off and my credit score dropped over 100 points. They started the negative reporting XX/XX/2018 and shut my online pay account off. I called them XX/XX/2018 and spoke with XXXX XXXX who said she will remove the account and stop reporting to the credit bureaus. I said I was fine with that. She also said to email her to have the online account turned back on. Weeks passed and nothing changed. I emailed several times with no response until I contacted MB Financials help desk to check on the status.Then the XXXX XXXX emailed as follows : I am in receipt of an email from MBs Helpdesk. 

Per my conversation with you on XX/XX/18, you had called in regarding a credit bureau dispute and to inquire on why your online access has been shut down. The email below is the only one I have received from you. Please note that the credit bureau dispute/request has been submitted, and if honored- you should see the changes in your report once that has been approved and updated. 

Unfortunately, we can not reactivate the online account until we stop reporting the bankruptcy. Once I receive the confirmation of same, I can submit a request for online access. In the interim, if you wish to make automatic payments, I have attached a copy of the ACH form that you can return with a copy of the voided check and we can have the ACH turned back on. 

Thank you, During our conversation she mentioned nothing about submitting a request ( to whom I don't know ). I have repeatedly emailed with no response, and I have called twice on XX/XX/XXXX and was sent to her voice mail ... no call back. 

This is not my issue/bankruptcy and should not be reported on my credit reports. My partner and I have several joint accounts and MB Financial is the only one reporting on "" MY '' reports. This is unfair to say the least. It makes no sense to be paying on an account that is reporting closed/charge off and will be on my credit report for 10 years!!! This is creating a financial hardship from the low credit score. I worked hard to build and keep a good score. This is ridiculous."

Student loan,"My original lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX ; this loan was considered a private loan that my parents took out to pay for my college education. XXXX XXXX XXXX had switched servicers to XXXX XXXX. The original promissory note I have, shows my father as applicant # 1/borrower, my mother as applicant # 2/co-borrower, and myself as student. This loan originated in XX/XX/XXXX. My father and I share the same name and I feel that has added confusion. My father always made the payments on this loan, as well as, collected tax documents and deductions on this loan, as the borrower. In XX/XX/XXXX, my father passed away from XXXX. My mother contacted XXXX and she was told about loan forgiveness. She submitted my fathers death certificate and she waited 32 days for an answer. Unfortunately, they did not approve the loan for forgiveness. Instead, XXXX has switched me, from student, to borrower and my mother stays as co-borrower. How did I go from being a student on a promissory note, to now the sole borrower? I have called XXXX, and it has been unsuccessful. I have requested documents including the denial letter stating why the loan wasnt forgiven as a result of my father 's death, the promissory note they have on file, as well as the loan terms indicating that I am now legally responsible for this loan. I have had no success in retrieving these documents. I have been told that I am not entitled to these documents from XXXX and to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX for the promissory note. I was told by a XXXX representative that the promissory note they have on file is not legible and she couldnt confirm who was supposed to be borrower/co-borrower.

I asked that the company remove any negative listings on my credit report but I logged in to check my credit report and they are listed. I checked the Tennessee database if Midwest Fidelity Services is licenses to collect debt in Tennessee and the website lists their application as pending. As such, they are trying to collect I do not owe, they can not provide any signed contract, and the loan that was allegedly made was done so by a foreign company in the XXXX XXXX XXXX who is not licensed to make loans in Tennessee and charging an illegal interest rate. It is also questionable that the company is trying to collect a debt in a state where their application is pending so they are not yet fully licensed to be engaging in this practice in Tennessee."

Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/2019 I ordered a credit card from Capital One on or about XX/XX/2019. At the time I ordered the card I informed the customer service agent that I receive my Social Security check on the XXXX Wednesday of the month and I need to receive a hard copy of their bill prior to that date so that I may make a timely payment. I specifically requested a change of my billing date so that I would not receive late charges. I was informed that the change would be made within the next one or two billing cycles. Since that time the change was not made and I made six additional calls ( once a month ) trying to confirm the change was made. Each time the rep initiated a new order to make the change because it was not made. On the last two occasions I spoke to the customer service supervisor who affirmed the change was made. The last occasion was today when I spoke with XXXX # XXXX. She indicated there was no record on my account of any changes were ever ordered. That was surprising because the previous Supervisor who identified himself as XXXX had personally promised me that the change would be made. In the meantime, I have been paying a substantial amount on my bill right when I get my direct deposit at the end of each month. Even so, I am being charged a {$30.00} late fee for the last two months because their payment date has not been changed. Their response despite their neglect and indifference to my request is to say pay on your bill prior to the late date. Capital One policies are so inflexible that they refuse to waive more than one late charge regardless of when I receive my funds or their culpability. Capital one also does not have any method for filing a complaint about their methods. Capital One clearly discriminates against the elderly and fixed income people similarly placed as myself. I believe Capital One has treated me unfairly and lied to me multiple times about changing my due date. I request your organization investigate the matter and order Capital One to accept responsibility for their misconduct, refund my unwarranted late fees, and change their policies to account for the special circumstances of elderly and fixed income people. This company lies to its customers, does not document their actions, and is indifferent to the complaints of its customers. It should not be allowed to operate in such a manner.

I called the phone number on the bills and finally got a hold of a customer service rep. The rep said I paid the bill too late in the day on the XXXX of XXXX and because of this when they finally took payment from my bank on the XXXX of XXXX they charged me the {$25.00} late fee in XXXX and another because I did not pay that XXXX late fee. I was furious, and instead of using profanity I told the rep to close my account and hung up. I got a bill today where another late fee was added and am very mad.

Be advised that the Holder Rule protects consumers claims & defenses against a creditor or assignee 16 C.F.R. 433.

The advisory opinion goes on to state that the Section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) of the FCRA addresses the duty to correct and update information by furnishers, or persons who furnish information to consumer reporting agencies ( CRA ) such as credit bureaus. In particular, this section requires a person that has furnished to a consumer reporting agency information that the person determines is not complete or accurate promptly notify the consumer reporting agency of that determination and provide any information needed to make it complete and accurate. Thus, on its face, this provision requires a furnisher to provide corrected or updated information to the consumer reporting agency that it had reported to originally. This duty extends to student loan accounts reported to CRAs, regardless of whether they were accurate at one point, because the section requires the furnisher both to update accounts as well as to correct even if the loan was correctly reported as delinquent, but has subsequently been paid."

I used Chase Bank ATM located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX NY. The check was accepted and I was informed that the funds will be available in my account on XX/XX/2018. I reside in XXXX, XXXX and had a scheduled flight from NY to XXXX. I returned to XXXX on XX/XX/2018. Later, I found that the check was not accepted due to ATM/deposit Error. In an effort to resolve the issue, I contacted Chase Bank via phone multiple times. The call center representatives came up with contradictory information every time. The details of my telephonic correspondence with chase is presented in an attached table. 

Finally, I traveled to New York on XX/XX/2018 to resolve this problem. I visited Chase Bank branch in the XXXX and personally met a banker on XX/XX/2018 to get a clearer picture. Even the banker in the branch was unable to help me and was astonished that they are unable to trace the original check. They suggested sending a copy of the check to the address of the party who wrote the check ( address was printed on the check ). I was informed that I shall have to wait 8-days for the check to be delivered to that address in NY. According to the banker, I must have received the copy of the check and updates about the problem much earlier. But even after the passage of around 3-weeks, the fate of this transaction in unknown. 

This ATM error and further mismanagement due to false and contradictory information presented by Chase Bank call centers has caused me a lot of mental and financial distress. I had to put my payments on hold resulting in accrued late payment fines from the creditors as well as loss of trust. It will also negatively impact my credit score. I had to travel to NY at the recommendation of the Chase Call Center representatives and the banker in the Chase Branch. And I am adding to my costs by staying in NY and waiting to receive updates from Chase. I request that either the check be returned to me promptly, or the amount be deposited in my account immediately. Further, I demand Chase Bank to compensate me for the financial and mental distress caused by their mishandling of the transaction as well as reimburse me for my stay in NY and travel between New York and XXXX. 

Thank you for your kind considerations."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently submitted a request for investigation of a which you refused. I submitted enough information for you to carry out a reasonable investigation of my dispute, since you obviously did not investigate this account thoroughly enough the last time I submitted one. They have already verified one of these fraudulent accounts and has removed that account. They have stated when I have called them, that they have contacted your agency numerous times to have the other account removed to no avail, often noting unreasonable hold times to get through to the fraud department. Experian will also not allow me to do these disputes online. 

If you had investigated properly, rather than use your XXXX system, you would have known, that not only have ever been late on this account, but that I am not the owner of this account, though your company claims to have verified this. 

It is at this time that I will point out that in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Experian ), and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, et al, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldn't merely "" parrot '' information from the creditors and collection agencies ... that they have to conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and the honesty/integrity of the creditor/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the XXXX system that does not even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

Additionally, the following accounts do not belong to me and have been removed by the other credit bureaus and deemed fraudulent : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX If you do not initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. As Im sure you are aware, each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter end up in court."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My complaint is about my HOME depot credit card. 
I paid my balance off of {$78.00}, in XXXX XXXX this left me with a XXXX balance. 

I relocated to an other state on XX/XX/XXXX, I went to local Home depot and bought some supplies and also ordered some on line. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I receive a statement from Home depot, stating I am past due! 
According to home depot, their billing cycle ended on XX/XX/XXXX, and they sent a statement out that was due XX/XX/XXXX. I never received that statement, BUT I did receive one on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Home depot 's states it's not their fault if USPS did not deliver my statement. 
After reviewing my statement first charge posted is XXXX XXXX and a second on XX/XX/XXXX. So how could they even have been on a STATEMENT CLOSING XXXX XXXX? 
Then I was told I had a cease and desist on my account, and they were not allowed to call me, First I have never in my XXXX years ever heard of such a thing on a credit account, I asked when it was put on and by who? 
I was told it may have been put on it XXXX they were not sure and did not know who had put it on. 
I called back and asked for a supervisor, and was told it was put on, XX/XX/XXXX my the prior agent I talked to. DA! 
Then I WAS TOLD purchases were made on XX/XX/XXXX, but my statement has first one posting on XX/XX/XXXX. 

WHY SO MUCH MISINFORMATION? 
WHY SO MUCH OF TELLING LESS THAN THE FACTS? 

FACT ONE I did not receive a statement until XX/XX/XXXX their fault my fault USPS fault it doesn't matter. 

FACT TWO I have no idea what a cease and desist on a credit account is, and I never had one put on so WHO DID AND WHY."
Mortgage,"A few months ago, I was advised that the web site for managing my Suntrust mortgage account ( https : //suntrustmortgage.customercarenet.com ) was being retired in favor of suntrust.com effective XX/XX/2019. 

The "" old '' site displays this message : Please enroll in Online Banking at suntrust.com to continue to manage your mortgage online. 
You will need to create a new userID and password using your mortgage account number ( if you do not have it handy, you may log in below and locate it before leaving this site ).

When I try to log onto the new site, I get error messages indicating that my records can not be matched. I am advised to contact Suntrust by phone, but have never been able to reach a human being to help me with my issues.

I am now afraid that ( 1 ) my loan servicing will be continued electronically despite the change in parameters, and that ( 2 ) I will stop receiving important information, notifications about my account, and the ability to manage my account without a lot of effort in dealing with Suntrust 's failure to manage my records and transfer them correctly to their new system. If they can not do something as simple as linking my account information so that I can open an online account as they have instructed, I have no basis for believing that they are recording or applying my payments correctly, either."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There are many mistakes appear in my report without my understanding.
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2019 I received an email from PNC Bank XXXX my mortgage servicer ) stating that my automatic payment of my mortgage was processed, however I noted the amount was double that of my mortgage payment. I verified with my checking account that two payments were removed on XX/XX/2019. One of which was the authorized mortgage amount of {$2000.00}. A second, unauthorized payment was also processed from my bank account in the amount of {$2000.00}. 
I then attempted to login to my online banking account and was found that I was locked out of my online banking portal with PNC bank. Therefore I could not verify my loan payments having been made and received. 
I then called PNC bank and spoke with a customer service rep ( XXXX ), he alerted me that PNC was aware of the situation and I had two courses of action, 1. receive a mailed check in the amount of my duplicate payment, this check would take 10-14 days via mail. 2. I could go through the verified process to receive a wire transfer in the amount of the duplicate payment. I told him that I could not wait 10 days to receive my funds back and that this was an unauthorized payment made to PNC that they needed to fix this problem. He alerted me that my only other course of action would be to call my personal bank and stop payment on the second unauthorized amount. 
I then called my personal bank, they told me the funds could not be stopped on their end but they were still pending and there was no reason PNC bank could not cancel the transaction in order for my funds to not be taken out of my account. 
- I called PNC bank back, I spoke with XXXX who gave me the same 2 courses of action as I was originally told. When I asked him to simply cancel the second unauthorized payment he told me that PNC bank does not cancel payments ... .. I escalated to his supervisor ( XXXX ) she verified that PNC bank would not cancel the payment on their end, she alerted me that "" upper management '' is aware of the situation, she did not know how they would return my funds or when I would receive them but I was to trust her in knowing that they are working on it and my funds would be returned. I asked how they would correspond with me going forward, and she said they would not initiate any communication, I would need to call back to find out more information about my funds. Meanwhile, PNC bank has {$2000.00} of my money that I did not authorize them to take from my account and I have no repercussions in knowing when they will be returned to me, if I will have my funds to pay the rest of my bills for the month and feed my family and I am left with no answers as to when or how my money that they took from me will be returned."

I was shocked because I haver never apply for any credit lines/loans/credit cards in Unites States till XX/XX/XXXX. After a few months I found out information about credit reports/score/credit history. I login to XXXX and XXXX XXXX to check information under my SSN and find out numerous accounts under my name which was opened when I even didnt had a visa to USA. Those accounts were opened within XXXX years when I lived in XXXX and dont even think about USA.

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/19 we opened our account at Santander bank at the branch located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX PA XXXX. XXXX XXXX opened the bank. We had a promotion that if we opened the account with {$25.00} and had {$2000.00} Direct Deposits in 90 days we would get {$400.00}. Today XX/XX/19 I called Santander Customer serivice to verify that I met the requirements and I would be getting my {$400.00}. I spoke to 4 customer services representatives and the code was not in the system where is should be. I believe it was deliberate retaliation by XXXX and XXXX because we did open any additional as they accused us just trying to take advantage of the promo. No customer should be subject to this kind of harassment and abuse the account should have been coded correctly. XXXX the customer service manager in XXXX XXXX thinks all is well for customers to spend an hour and half to ensure that things are done correctly. XXXX refused give me her supervisors name and XXXX is refusing to entertain my questions because she thinks it is acceptable that customers need to spend a hour and 22 minutes to get a resolutions and that is how some customers are treated. Please advised the bank did not even give a plastic case for my check registered. She has made no offer to compensate me for the poor customer service and thinks I should be happy that I am getting the promotion. She is also refusing to provide proof that the account was opened correctly or explanation why 4 customer people could not confirm the promo was applied."
Mortgage,"My ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) escrow account was short for this year because we had built a new home and taxes were based off the lot appraisal only. I ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) contacted Penny Mac Loan Services on XX/XX/XXXX. Because our escrow was short we were making a payment of {$1700.00} to make up the shortfall. I decided to make one lump sum payment of {$2800.00} to pay off the escrow shortfall with a confirmation number supplied by Penny Mac Loan services of XXXX. It was drafted from my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I very specifically asked if our new payment of {$1300.00} ( normal payment less escrow shortage ) would start on XX/XX/XXXX. The Penny mac representative assured me my new payment of {$1300.00} would be effective that date. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my Pennymac account and noticed it still showed {$1700.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. I again called Penny Mac customer service. They again assured me only the correct amount of {$1300.00} would be billed to my account on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my autopay payment had not been subtracted as normal. I called to verify that no changes had been made that effected autopay. They stated that the payment would be debited on XX/XX/XXXX because the first was the Friday. And stated for now THE THIRD TIME that my payment would be {$1300.00} as I had paid off the escrow shortage completely. 

On XX/XX/XXXX. After three different representatives stating my payment would be {$1300.00} because of paying off the escrow shortage in total Penny Mac billed me {$1700.00}. They stated they "" messed up ''."

I contacted TransUnion in good faith to ask them to delete the inquiries that they had illegally re-added. All dates are listed below. These inquiries add a hardship and my rights were violated by TransUnion. Please make TransUnion stop victimizing me for their mistake. As a resolution, I request that all TransUnion inquiries be deleted permanently from my report as a violation took place when they were illegally added.

Debt collection,"After being denied credit, i pulled my credit report. As i reviewed it i noticed several bogus accounts listed. As such i disputed with the three bureaus. The collector verified the debt. I was never sent any notifucation letters or right to dispute communications from them. I therefore sent a dispute letter i. Accordance with my rights under the FDCPA which was ignored. Its been over 60 days and i have had no response. This is not my debt, the have willfully ignored and violated the FDCPA and laws. This continued to hurt my credit and inflict damages to me fininacially as well as my reputation.

I have also sent numerous emails to both the caand XXXX.

Mortgage,"I have a Mortgage with CitiMortgage. It is for a condo in XXXX XXXX XXXX, SC. I have had this Mortgage for 12 years. This condo requires Flood Insurance. The condo association is required to provide Flood Ins. Citibank and the insurance company communicate every year to confirm. This year they did not communicate. Citibank purchased Flood insurance for the unit in addition to the normal Flood Insurance I get through the association. They added an escrow to my account. Thats when I had to get involved. I connected with the Insurance group at Citibank. They provide an online portal to up load documents. I provided the information via the upload site. Citibank never received. Today, Citibank admitted that the site sometimes does not work. If you try to upload the same document twice, it will say it uploaded successfully, when it does not. Normally, I do not have to get involved at this level. We did not pay the escrow, and Citibank put a credit alert to my credit bureau that I had missed a payment. This was incorrect, we have paid every month on time. I am not sure if this practice is legal or ethical. Citibank is does care, and is requesting more fees and escrow payments even when they have proof of insurance."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Accessed Equifax credit report and noticed error. Account on report I had never opened.

Debt collection,Received notification of newly added collections account on XXXX XXXX from Midwest Recovery stating that I owed {$1300.00} to fictious original creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The account was opened with Midwest recovery XXXX XXXX does n't even include the original date they claim I received a pay day loan from the fictious XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX company. Never once did I receive any written communication requesting that I confirm the debt in question. If the debt or account truly accurate my current address should have been in the file when transferred to Midwest Recovery for collections. I 'm more concerned that this another fraudulent account due to the theft of my identity in XXXX. This new claim has been posted on all three credit bureaus and has significantly dropped my fico score. Until then I will continue to dispute this company and how they conduct business illegally. They have violated the FCPA with there illegal reporting practices.
Checking or savings account,"Hello, We received a check from someone who we thought wanted to stay in our rental unit. That individual claimed that the check came from their place of business and that they accidentally sent too much money as some was intended for their travel agent. They asked us to refund a portion of the check to their travel agent. 

We waited until Chase confirmed that the deposit was accepted and then refunded a portion of the check to the individual via Chase XXXX ( XXXX ). The individual then stated that a work obligation came up and they would no longer be able to stay in our rental unit. We then refunded them an additional portion of the check via Chase XXXX as Chase had shown the funds were available and I never received a message from Chase that there was a bounced check. 

Unfortunately, I now come to discover that the check had bounced. I am shocked, disappointed, and angry that Chase did not immediately notify me that the check had bounced. As someone who has never bounced a check, this should have been setting off alarms at Chase and they should have contacted me via phone, email, text, or anything to notify me. I did not even receive an internal message when I log in that the check had bounced. 

I called Chase 's fraud & claims department and they were not willing to assist me at all. I spoke with XXXX and he was not helpful or sympathetic to my matter. In total, we were defrauded out of {$3000.00} between 3 payments via Chase XXXX. Chase 's current policies and customer service will continue to help criminals while hurting and angering their loyal customers. Chase should have immediately warned me that the check had bounced and I would have been able to help prevent additional fraudulent activity. Chase also should not have shown the check 's funds as available only to have it bounce later on. 

{$3000.00} is not a material amount of money to Chase, but to my wife and I, who are loyal Chase customers, it is."
Checking or savings account,"I opened a CD with capitalone bank with an amount of XXXX for a year, at the interest rate of 2.7 %. Upon reaching maturity, I was not paid out the correct amount. The total amount came out to be XXXX instead of XXXX, short of {$53.00}. 
Upon complaining, the support team kept arguing and giving me a formula to calculate and even after applying that formula, the interest rates didn't add up ( formula given [ balance x interest rate ] ) /365 ( 366 for leap year ) x days in a month ). 
When I responded saying, the results do't add up still, the agents kept saying they can only give formula and can not verify the interest and said they would put in a request for it to be verified, but the amount was never verified or any explanation given. I felt cheated out of the amount owed as if I had defaulted on my cd they wouldn't refrain from withdrawing a penalty, but when they are at fault, they refuse to correctly pay out the amount promised."

AFTER THAT WAS DONE, I APPLIED FOR CREDIT WITH XXXX AGAIN, AND THEY AGAIN DENIED ME SAYING I NEEDED TO ADD A PHONE NUMBER TO MY CONSUMER STATEMENT PORTION. AFTER CALLING EQUIFAX AGAIN, THEY REMOVED A FRAUD INDICATOR ALERT, AT MY REQUEST, AND THEN SAID THE PHONE NUMBER WOULD BE ADDED IN THE NEXT 30 DAYS.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX, based on a accident ( disaster ), I faced the financial hardship. Wells Fargo is my mortgage lender from XXXX, and I asked them for a mortgage assistance. They offered several options but asked for permission to check my credit score. At this moment the score was about XXXX. However, Wells Fargo asked XXXX XXXX for assistance, and when results came, it was a very unpleasant surprise. The new FICO score has dropped for 83 points - due to the Wells Fargo/XXXX XXXX inquiry. When asked for information why it has happened, the answer was that this score is based upon XXXX  report. I called XXXX and they denied providing such a wrong information. At this moment am disputing this sudden drop of the score and I am asking removal of such inquiry. 
As far as I know, the official credit bureaus are the only providers of credit information. Many new providers of scores are doing it for less money and are increasing the market. Their information is not always correct. They maybe are pleasing the lenders who are paying for information, but it can create harm to customers - intentionally or inadvertently. 
I am informing CFPB because this has happened under your watch of the compliance with FDCPA."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have learned over the last several months that I am a victim of identity theft.

I have mailed in and uploaded many documents to the credit agencies and creditors to undue these thefts but non of my attempts have concluded in results. I have now contacted an attorney to proceed further if this last recorded attempt is ignored as the others.

Debt collection,On XX/XX/2018 I bought a mattress from XXXX XXXX. I chose to finance the bed from your company Westcreek Financial the cost of the mattress was XXXX. I signed the documents from your company and I gave my correct bank account number and debit card number as well or the payment to XXXX XXXX would have never have gone through. On XX/XX/2018 I came into a large sum of money and called your company to ask for a payoff amount which I paid in full. Since that time your company and I have been in a dispute with you telling me that I owe you XXXX. You have reported a false report to the credit bureau that borders on fraud. Yesterday in a final attempt this matter your company and my bank had a three way conversation in which my bank told you that if you had submitted a charge of XXXX it would have been paid. Your response to me was that the payment of XXXX was kicked back to you due to a wrong bank account number or debit card. My bank confirmed that all the information that was on the application was true and correct. So if the payment did not go through it was an error on your part not mine but yet you still argued with my bank. You offered to take this fraudulent amount of XXXX off of my credit report if I paid you that sum. I checked my account with XXXX  and you had yet again altered information fraudulently as of XX/XX/2018 because I checked my credit report after speaking with you. Your company needs to remove all of the fraudulent information you put on my credit report because it seems to me that you are using the misinformation you gave to the credit bureau as ransom just to get me to pay a debt that is not mine!!!
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been in contact with XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX when I discovered that my account was listed on closed/charged-off on my credit report and not reflecting monthly payments and the account being open and paid on time. I have spoken to multiple customer service representatives starting in XX/XX/XXXX and most recently on XX/XX/XXXX, in which they have been unable to assist. All of the customer service representatives have stated that my account is current, paid, open, and never been a charge off or repossessed ; even when I escalate it to customer service management. I sent a letter via certified mail to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX requesting for the account to be updated on my credit report. On a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX in response to my certified letter apologizing for the mistake and that the account payment history and status would be updated to reflect Current/Open and paid on time ; however, this issue has been yet to be corrected. Most recently upon reviewing my credit report in XX/XX/XXXX, they have shown the account as being closed as of XX/XX/XXXX, which is not true. The account is open and paid as agreed, in which most months I have overpaid to pay down my balance so that I can get rid of XXXX XXXX altogether and have the vehicle paid off. As the customer service representatives have all stated, this vehicle and my account has never been repossessed nor charged off and the account is open and current. XXXX XXXX is taking advantage of consumers and refuses to correct their errors, only wanting to collect money and not be of any assistance. I also know that I am not the only consumer that has had this error from them, as I have spoken to 25 other individuals that are experiencing the same issues with XXXX XXXX incorrectly reporting to the credit bureaus while their internal systems say otherwise."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I sent all three credit bureaus a certified letter to investigate this Navy federal cu hard inquiry XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18 from my credit reports. It has been well over 60 days and still not heard from any of the bureau. This violates the FCRA laws that are in place to protect consumers. The bureaus are to report accurate information and respond to disputes in a timely manner. This hard inquiry has caused hardship to me and stress as well as I being denied credit and home loans.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Regions Bank account # XXXX. I received a notice from Regions bank stating that this account was pas due. I knew I didn't have an open account with Regions so I cent a certified letter to them which they received asking for information on the account because i didn't have an account with them. I never received anything further from Regions. I received an alert from a credit monitioring site stating that an account on my credit was just marke as 30 days late. I called Regions and they told me that I had a Streamline account and that the yearly fee had been assesed. I informed Regions that I no longer had a Streamline account with them and this account was closed months prior if not a year. I don't even have a checking/savings/or loan account with Regions anymore so I asked her how was it possible to have a fee assessed on a closed account. This streamline account was one that I was approved for {$500.00} that I could barrow money from the account and make monthly payments until the barrowed amount was paid back. Regions closed this account long before I left the bank totally. The account was in good standing and had been closed and updated on my credit file for several months to a year. I do not understand how this bank could charge a {$25.00} fee on a closed account that they closed and how could they add a 30 day late to an account that was closed but in good standings. How would I pay a yearly fee on an account that was closed, one that I didn't even have access to because it was closed and I don't bank with Regions since XX/XX/XXXX. The person I spoke with at Regions bank on XX/XX/XXXX stated the account wasn't properly closed which I don't understand wither because it was closed long before this happened and it showed on my credit report which I can provide to show that it was closed. I then proceded to ask the lady from Regions ok, clearly this was a mistake on REgions part so how do I rectify this incorrect information on my credit report that you all reported and she told me that she could send a note to her lead but this was something that I would have to take care of by disputing with the credit bureaus. Why could it be so easy to report incorrect information but not go back to update the credit bureaus with the correct information? This account was never late as it had been closed and in good standing. She removed the charges fromt the closed account said that she believed it wasn't properly closed which I don't believe is true because I showed on the Regions account that it was closed and it showe on the credit report that it was closed. Waking up to a 51 point drop in a credit score because of a mistake by Regions is not fair and then the Regions rep acted as if she didn't care. I have disputed this with XXXX  and XXXX and it's not on XXXX  and the account is as it should be on XXXX ( in good standings ). I have attached Pictures from my credit report to show that this account was closed as Regions closed it OVER a year ago. They late was added the end of XX/XX/XXXX or first of XX/XX/XXXX"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",i am XXXX years old. i started using credit at XXXX when i bought my first car and since have owned numerous credit card accounts - home loans - lines of personal credit etc.. for over 40 years - several years ago - my wife and i of XXXX years marriage - divorced and i closed all of my accounts - since then i have opened several accounts -so all of my current open credit is about XXXX years old - the problem is that the formula the 3 credit reporting agencies use to define the length of time i have had credit key on the oldest start date of all of my open credit accounts thus reporting that i have only had credit for a couple of years -- this is hurting my credit score as the time i am reported as having credit to my name is only XXXX years - this is not a good thing because it shows i am very new to managing credit. this is a flaw in the formula - i have had credit for over 45 years but they all three report that i have only had credit for a couple of years. i disputed this with all three but they will not change my score or the length of time i have managed credit. this is not a true representation and is hurting my score and causing me to have problems getting a mortgage. they need to fix this so the length of time is not a couple of years. this puts me in the same group as a teenager just starting out in life.

Checking or savings account,This has been going on very continuously the past 6-7 mos. I never signed up for overdraft. I have locked my debit card for over a month now. With regions lock it. I have been charged {$36.00} numerous times. If there is even 1 cent in my account they have paid for things as silly as a {$1.00} membership to some app then charge me {$36.00}. If the money is not in the bank I cant withdraw from an atm. Or use it anywhere. So how is it legal for them to choose what they want to pay for.? I'm so fed up with regions bank. If I were to go back from the time I opened my account til now it would be over {$1000.00} in fees. Then if its negative already and then charged and charged I am just too the point I feel robbed. They have changed the type of checking account I have with no notice of monthly fees that would be charged. I will not pay another penny to them. Because of all the money they have robbed of me they should have plenty to cover whatever amount it is today they say I owe now. I dont even use this account anymore. I go from having {$41.00} in the bank to within a few days - {$130.00} then two weeks - {$250.00} how is that possible when I personally have not used the account and it is supposed to be locked. I have cancelled everything. And they still find something to mess me all up over and over month after and I have had enough. If they want to report it to credit. I dont care. It will be worth not to see another dime of my money to go to that bank. I'm changing to a new bank. New start. Regions bank is horrible. Any bank that takes your money when it is not available is ridiculous. I never signed up for protection. So therefore it should of never happened.

Mortgage,"Based on the open case with Specialized Loan Servicing Account number XXXX. The vendor mentioned in their response that they sent a "" Notice of Default and Notice of Intent to Foreclose '' On XX/XX/ 2019 I received a package from Specialized Loan Servicing LLC informing me about the compliant I filed with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) with regard to the servicing, reference case no XXXX and XXXX. Specialized Loan Servicing mentioned that they sent me this notice "" Notice of Default and Notice of Intent to Foreclose ''. The letter was found buried in the stack of papers which consisted of a Mortgage Assistance Application. 

The issue I have is, I never received the letter "" Notice of Default and Notice of Intent to Foreclose : '' When Specialized Loan Servicing mentioned the fact in the CFPB Case No XXXX and XXXX. I fully understand that there is no limitation on fraud, based on the grievance and the noted fraud committed needs to be addressed by Specialized Loan Servicing LLC, why? because the fraud started with the Originator XXXX XXXX XXXX, which the fraud continued to the second, third and now fourth interloper, which is Specialized Loan Servicing LLC. Since Specialized Loan Servicing feel that they not nothing to do with the fraud, based on my overstanding, Specialized Loan Servicing inherited the fraud, by buying the Deed of Trust, which was separated from the Mortgage and sold on the stock market. 

In addition, since Specialized Loan Servicing believe they had nothing to do with my grievances, I want them to know that Clause 20 of the Deed of Trust require me to send a notice of grievance prior to judicial action, and to give the Note Holder a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action. As you are the recent servicer and agent for the Note Holder, if the grievances are beyond Specialized Loan Servicing ability to correct, I would like for them to forward my request ( Grievance ) to the owner of the securities. 

The package received on XX/XX/XXXX, is entirely too large to scan and upload. if you want to see what was sent to me, with the "" Notice of Default and Notice of Intent to Foreclose : '' dated XX/XX/2019, was hidden in the XX/XX/ 2019 package, which was place there, so I wouldn't have a chance to respond."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","To Whom It may concern. XX/XX/XXXX I made a big mistake in XX/XX/XXXX. I had let some credit cards get out of hand, and I was looking at paying them off. 
Somehow, I got a message from XXXX XXXX about that time, Erase your credit card debt. I made the mistake of contacting them. They were talking about a "" negotiated settlement, '' which sounded pretty good. When they told me to stop making payments, I told them that would ruin my credit. They said that no one would negotiate unless the account was delinquent. They said that it would be very easy to clear my credit rating when they finished. 
Im sure you have heard this story before. I ended up with a high-interest loan for what they paid on the credit cards. Then I got a XXXX Tax form ( Earnings statement ) from the credit cards for the unpaid balance, and paid tax on it. I could have paid off the cards for what it cost me. 
I have endured the consequences for 7 years because I felt that I had created the problem, out of my own ignorance. 
It has been over 7 years, and I am still paying exorbitant interest rates, except on my VA loan. 
You can see that I am paying all of my debts on time, and I can lower the balances, if I can lower the interest rate. Currently, I see nothing on my credit report that I can protest. 
Please, just point me in the right direction to resolve this problem.

On XX/XX/2019 at around XXXX XXXX someone finally picked up the phone after 5 minute waiting. Their representative made me aware that the call is being recorded, so i decided to record the call as well on my end and made her aware of it. Then she told me that i did not have permission to record the call. I asked her why was it ok for her company to record the call while I was not allowed. She put me on old to speak to her manager and came back to tell me that it was their company policy and hang up on me. I was not able to get someone on the phone after that.

Based on the company 's transaction records, my first payment was made in XX/XX/XXXX, 16 months after I started the account. 

My first statement of record was XX/XX/XXXX, which I have enclosed and it shows a payment due of {$260.00}. 

On the XX/XX/XXXX statement, which I have enclosed, you see a payment made on XX/XX/XXXX of {$260.00}. None of the payments that are on the pdf statements on XXXX XXXX website are in my digital transaction history, also on their website, which I have screen shot and enclosed. 

I am including the most recent statement for your review, which shows of the {$4000.00} financed, payments and credits are {$3800.00} and I still owe {$3900.00}, which is basically the balance I started with. 

I did not pay on time each month, but tried to double up to keep up with the account. I went on XXXX XXXX website to pull XX/XX/XXXX statements, and as you can see, they show nothing due on the XX/XX/XXXX. I believe my balance per their pdf statement files do not match their digital transaction records, which means there is a chance I am being charged more finance charges than I should be. 

Even though I realized there was no finance charge for 2 years, I do not understand why no payments are shown in the attached transaction history. 

I have included the XX/XX/XXXX statement to show how all of the fees were billed at that time which amounted to thousands of dollars. In addition to that, I am being charged {$95.00} per month in finance charges on top of the amount due. 

I contacted XXXX and the representative only wanted to know how much I would pay, even when I pointed out a problem on my account. 

I need help to make sure this billing process is correct and fair, and to get a true transaction statement on how much I paid in XX/XX/XXXX, since the bank shows no payments in XX/XX/XXXX on my transaction history. 

I also want to confirm that it is legal for me to have been charged 28 % finance charges, as I have been over charged as a woman of XXXX, in the past, by other banks, and was notified by the Federal Trade Commision ( i.e. XXXX XXXX auto loan ). 

I want to be sure that the high finance charges of {$95.00} per month are lawful.

Checking or savings account,I added my son to my NFCU business account as an authorized user about 2 years ago or so. He was added with no problem. Today XX/XX/2018 my business assets are frozen because he owes them money and they blocked me out of my own business accounts. Apparently he owes them over {$5000.00} and they restricted my account because according ti them they can do that. My son went into a branch as was grossly discriminated against and treated like a criminal when I sent him to get a cashiers check. He has called in several times with me and they have been rude and We have been hung up on and when trying to speak to a supervisor I am advised that there is no one working that someone will return my call in 24 to 48 hours. According to what I know these accounts are from XX/XX/2010 and they are declining to forward information to validate the debt. On the recorded line the rep insisted he say that He acknowledge that he owes the money after repeated attempts by the rep in their recovery she hung up and became rude. By them restricting access to my buainess account it will cost me a total of about XXXX to XXXX in fees and other legal costs because of that. My business should not be responsible of them not verifying his information when I added him over 2 years ago. They should have said no of instead taking opportunity to try to collect on a business account that frankly he is only authorized to go when I am not available. I feel that these actions were initiated as a retaliation because they made me go through hoops about a code word on the account and because I stated that I would report them to the proper authorities.

No legally required notorized verification was provided to me showing that these items are mine nor proof from the lenders, which is required to be sent in the 1st 45 days of a dispute and then the bureaus must be sent to me with notorized proof they are mine.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a Paypal Cashback Mastercard from Synchrony Bank while I was going through a difficult time. This was in XX/XX/2018. I had just been evicted from the house I was renting and didn't have much money. They gave me a very generous credit limit, but due to certain obligations while I was staying with family, it quickly got whittled down to almost nothing. I was making the minimum monthly payments with no problems at first, but soon I noticed they started to increase my minimum monthly charge a little more each time. Some months it was as high as {$97.00} - higher if I couldn't afford to cover it. XX/XX/XXXX charge was {$73.00} and last month 's was also {$73.00}. I cancelled the card last month because I couldn't deal with it any more, paying that much every month and only the barest scraps were being applied towards my overall debt with the rest being eaten up by unreasonable fees, charges, interest, etc. I asked if they could reduce the amount due to my hardship but they refused, stating the fees, interest rates, APR, etc. were all pre-set at a certain limit. The card is no longer active and they are still charging me ridiculous amounts even when I can not use it. The last statement I got said I owed {$73.00}. I paid that, but only about {$20.00} of that went towards the whole amount ; the rest was interest on purchases ( XXXX for purchases and XXXX for cash advances ). My current APR on this card is 28.99 % which is ridiculous and I think they themselves know it and just took advantage of me due to my poor credit history. These people are predatory and should not be allowed to trap people into financial slavery like they do."

Despite repeatedly requesting by phone and by email not to be contacted with non account related email, I continue to receive marketing offers inviting me to "" save money on my mortgage '' and "" download the app ''. As an XXXX XXXX  with experience in digital financial products I can confidently attest to the fact that the content of these emails is only pretextually related to my mortgage and it is marketing garbage. What is especially concerning is that JPMC has passed on personal, private information about myself and my mortgage, including email, interest rate and mortgage balance to XXXX. I am appalled at their disregard of my privacy."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Vanderbilt has been the worst mortgage company by far that I have ever worked with. They have given me nothing but problems and false reporting throughout the entire relationship. I am so glad that they sold the load to XXXX. 

Back in the XXXX, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX time frame that had a totally random faulty reporting of late or missed payment on my credit report. When I saw it ( only because I was closing on another property and the lending company saw it ) I called Vanderbilt and they sent the attached letter apologizing for their mistake and promising to remove it. As you can see from my current report.. .they NEVER actually removed it. A late payment from spring of XXXX is STILL on my credit report. 

In XXXX there was a hurricane in XXXX Florida which is where this property is located. Vanderbilt mortgage pro-actively reached out to me to suggest a disaster relief plan that would have me defer three months payments. They told me to skip three months payments and then on the 4th month they gave me a new amount that I would be required to pay for 6 months. ( this amount represented my normal monthly amount plus an additional amount to make up for the three months by spreading it out over 6 months ). I did everything that Vanderbilt told me to do. I skipped the three payments and I set up by automatic bill pay with the bank to pay a higher amount for 6 months and then resume with my normal monthly payments. 

I was never any days late. 

I heard that sometimes when they set up deferred payment deals that they plan on marking you as 30 days late, even though in my conversations with them before agreeing to do this.. They assured me that there would be NO negative reporting on my credit report. 

They did report me as late.. .however, I never missed nor was late on any payments with Vanderbilt mortgage. 

Very predatory lending practices by Vanderbilt. I hope to never have to do business with them again. 

Their predatory practices prevented me from closing on a new home which was to be my first home owned primary residence since XXXX.

They claimed to have send me out a letter but I have not received any letter at all bearing my signature or showing that I have any contract with them or any copies of HIPAA authorization. I am guessing that they are unaware that an itemized document or a printout of a bill does not constitute verification.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","on XX/XX/XXXX, I started a Identity theft claim and all fraudulent activities were removed. aout 6 months later a creditor put the debt back on my credit profile.

BMW is billing someone else name under my social security number and I have sent all the information that is reequired. My latest call was to XXXX Customer service Fraud department.

Mortgage,"I currently have a LTV of 78.00 % on my current home mortgage. I have requested the private mortgage insurance to be cancelled. The loan servicer, ( Chase Home Mortgage ), the PMI company ( XXXX XXXX ) and the loan holder ( XXXX XXXX ) are requiring me to get a BPO ( Brokers Price Opinion ) which costs {$100.00} for determination that my house has not decreased in value. 

Per the HPA ( Homeowners Protection Act ), when a homes LTV reaches 78 % of the original mortgage amount the loan servicer has to request the PMI be cancelled. Chase Mortgage will not request the PMI to be cancelled unless a BPO is obtained. I am being penalized by paying extra on my mortgage to get the PMI cancelled earlier than the predicted amoritization date of when my LTV would be 80 % which was predicted to be XX/XX/XXXX. 

Furthermore, if i had not been forward thinking and not checked on this my PMI would have been automatically canceled in XX/XX/XXXX, however my LTV would have most likely been around 70 % at that point. I would not have received a refund on the PMI that was not required to be paid based on I reached a LTV of 78 % in XX/XX/XXXX. I would have paid approximately an extra XXXX on PMI that was not required and that should have been cancelled automatically when my LTV reached 78 %."
Checking or savings account,"SunTrust a few weeks past sent my wife a new card. She was inconvenienced and let in a bad situation because she couldn't get gas when she learned it was canceled. No text or email notification was sent. Now they sent her a new card and did the exact same thing. 

They have our email, text, phone information, any method of communication they need to reach us, but make no effort to assist and communicate. 

Then when I ask why the card was canceled they claimed a merchant compromised but would not provide any information about the merchant. 

Some things not right and the process need to be changed. My wife could have been at a restaurant when this happened."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Kia Motors has charged me taxes for the whole XXXX year for my previous lease with them and are also charging me taxes for the whole year of XXXX for my current lease. I should only be charged for taxes for the amount of months in that year that I owned either car. However they are charging me for the whole year for both. 
I calles them to dispute this, they said I need to pay the full amount and ask for a refund of each extra tax they charged me. They will then process this and refund me. I was given conflicting information about this when i paid the full amount of taxes for the first car, was told that I would only be charged for the prorated amount for the new car. However that was a lie and I am being charged the full amount for both cars. 
I dont think this is right. I shouldnt be charged the whole amount if I didnt lease the car for the whole year. They should only charge a prorated amount no matter what the town charges them for taxes. What about people that are not aware of this process?! They pay Kias taxes for the car that they didnt even lease for the whole year."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I attempted to send payment to my landlord via XXXX, which I had done five or six times before without a problem. The transaction was scheduled for XX/XX/2019, and it reported as successful on my end. The money never arrived at my landlord 's bank. I re-sent my rent, again via XXXX, and it went through, but now I have been double charged for rent and have not been refunded for the initial missing payment. My landlord and I have both contacted his bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and they have no record of an inbound payment. I have contacted my own bank, Ally, several times. They closed the ticket the first time after giving me some confirmation numbers that were of no help. I contacted them again twice, with no resolution. They say they are reviewing it and that it can take up to 90 days, but I'll be missing {$700.00} from my account while they pass around my third ticket in their offices with seemingly no recourse. 

Summary : I sent {$700.00} from Ally Bank via XXXX to my landlord. It never made it to him, but it was deducted from my account. I want my {$700.00} back."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Information used to verify identity over the phone is outdated, misleading, and an effort to discourage and deny a copy of my consumer report that I am entitled to. 

Specifically asking trick questions of what neighborhood I lived in 25 years ago and that is no longer on my report. The options were XXXX XXXX instead of XXXX XXXX causing me to fail that question. 

Asking the specific amount of a current loan that was financed within hundreds of dollars apart making it difficult to say with out having a credit report in front of me causing me to fail that one. 

Asking about a county I lived in in 1989 ... 30 years ago Who do I know that lives in a city I have never heard of. 

This outdated, misleading, and trick questioning is unreasonable and causes an undue burden. This is considered to be done willingly and with malice."
Debt collection,"Midwest Recovery Systems reported a collection debt to my XXXX Credit file on XX/XX/XXXX for {$300.00} medical bill. I never received a 30 day disclosure of any collection activity. When I called them on XX/XX/XXXX after finding out this debt was placed on my credit file by XXXX monitoring service, I was told this was a medical office debt with XXXX XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX and that the debt was sold from another collection agency ( XXXX or XXXX? ) to Midwest Recovery Systems. Midwest Recovery Systems has violated federal law by not sending me a 30 day notice to validate the collection to my address on file with XXXX. This caused my credit score to drop XXXX points and I intend seeking full restitution and damages if this is not removed from my credit file immediately. If the debt was originally occurred XX/XX/XXXX then it would make the debt 6 1/2 years ( six and half years ) old now which I knew nothing about. This is an illegal practice of debt selling and manipulation that violates the FCRA. Furthermore it can not be reported beyond 7 years. If a collection company can report to a credit bureau then they sure can pull my current address to send me a letter regarding a debt. This item needs to be removed immediately from my credit file."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I recently lost my job and was struggling to find work, 3 creditors closed my credit cards because I had some monthly payments being reversed. Capital one ( 2 credit cards were closed with HIGH interest and late fees applied ) XXXX credit card and XX/XX/XXXX credit card as well. All 3 of those creditors closed my accounts and I am not sure why, my only guess can be the payment reversals from my bank ( XX/XX/XXXX ). XXXX is no longer my bank as I recently was a victim of a scam and fooled with a fake check. I have been undergoing extremely stressful and unfortunate situaitons and my credit score just last month ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) was in the 620s and it has dropped SIGNIFICANTLY for reasons I cant even understand."
Vehicle loan or lease,"To Whom It May Concern, As a borrower of Santander Consumer USA, I have reached out to the company with my concerns about the auto loan account that I have open with them. I have addressed the fact that I, as a low income borrower, was not aware of the 27.99 % APR on the auto loan, which exceeds California 's usury rate. In fact, they exceed the rate by 17 %. I've been a borrower of theirs for over two years and have not yet paid half to the principal, and have reached out to them with major issues to break down into detail about where my own money was going towards. I have politely asked for refinancing options as well, but was denied this. I have asked for Extended Payment Plan, which they had charged an additional 5 % without notifying me, and the representative over the phone never clarified to me. I have tried my best to keep up with the payments, but feel that I will need to reach out to those of higher authority to help alleviate some stress. My auto loan borrowed was initially {$12000.00} to finance for 60 months. Beginning XXXX of XXXX, I have only paid less than {$1000.00} towards principal which doesn't make any sense, for I've made payments on time prior to my recent financial struggles in the past year of XXXX. I've closed my credit accounts to pay for this auto loan that is clearly a depreciating asset, but none of my money has gone towards the principal of this car. I've kept in contact with Santander about my situation in hopes that our business could become better, but I honestly feel a deep disrespect from the lender as I've tried my best to be cordial. On XX/XX/XXXX on a Thursday evening, I've called to manage my past due balance to bring my account back to current, and was told by 2 separate representatives an amount of {$620.00} made before XX/XX/XXXX would bring my account back up to current. I was not told of any other late fees that would be charged onto my account. Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to confirm this amount and was actually charged an additional {$260.00} onto my account, which was only three business days, and after speaking with a representative and a Supervisior who've clarified the additional charge. I asked to be waived of these extra charges because I was not given this information, and was again denied. If there is a reason for my default, I believe that Santander is in exploit of that. I am not satisfied as a consumer and would like to report this scandal. If Santander strives to be a company of prosperity and respect, they wouldn't dig a deeper threshold for their own consumers. Files will not be included until I receive an e-mail via CFPB. Thank you for your time!"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My husband, XXXX XXXX, and I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, OH on or about XX/XX/XXXX. This was a two year lease, expiring on XX/XX/XXXX, so we traded it in to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX in exchange for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. We made our last payment for the XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and paid the amount owed for the XXXX at trade in ( see the bank statements, attached ). 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, we received a bill from GM Financial for payments on the XXXX allegedly owed in XXXX and XXXX of that year. We contacted our salesman at XXXX, sent in the vehicle return receipt to GM Financial, and believed that the dealership and GM Financial had worked things out. We didnt receive any more bills after that. 

As you will see from my attached letter, they had not resolved this billing issue, and our credit scores dropped approximately 50 points over the XXXX holiday. I filed a dispute with XXXX  in XXXX of XXXX. The balance was changed to {$0.00}, but issues remained. 

Ultimately, I filed a second dispute in XXXX since our scores did not recover, and I still had late payment status showing on my credit report ( attached ). 

This dispute was not corrected, and this issue became known in the course of applying for a home equity line of credit from XXXX XXXX this week ( also attached ). I  contacted XXXX today, they confirmed that these amounts were past due, and they ultimately sent me to GM Financial. GM Financials Loss Prevention rep ( XXXX ) reviewed my account, confirmed that they were still looking for these two payments, and directed me to the dealership. My question to both was how is it possible that we could owe payments on a vehicle that was in legal possession of the manufacturers dealership/ financial arm? I had sent both parties evidence of our non-possession of the XXXX in XXXX, yet this report stood. In both cases, the parties pointed me elsewhere. XXXX was unwilling or unable to help me beyond that point. 

I then left a message for the general manager at XXXX XXXX hours ago, with no response so far. 

Please help. At no point did any of these companies take any accountability regarding this mistake that one of these parties made, and it is negatively impacting us, despite our best efforts to be as fiscally responsible as possible. 

Thank you so much for reading this complaint. If you have any questions, please call. XXXX. 

Best, XXXX XXXX"
Debt collection,"XXXX sold their XXXX  accounts to Citibank. When I saw the notification in XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX and told them not to automatically renew the membership on that card as I did not want a new credit card or company as I was living overseas and did not need the XXXX membership anymore. ( I was home stateside on holiday when I saw the mail notification and called immediately ). I told the customer service rep that I did not call the number to activate the card and was cutting it up as we were speaking and the gentleman told me it was taken care of. The account would be closed. When I returned to the States in XX/XX/XXXX, I see in my junk mail pile envelops from Citibank. I opened one assuming it was the standard "" come back to us '' bulk mailings and saw it was an outstanding bill for the {$60.00} XXXX renewal in XX/XX/XXXX plus interest and late fees amounting to a total of {$280.00}. I immediately called XXXX customer service who told me they could not help and I had to call Citibank. I called Citibank and they said I had to write the dispute department ( US mail or Fax only ) and they they would NOT have anyone reach out to me as it was my issue to resolve. The gentleman ( XXXX ) at the call center ( XXXX XXXX in XXXX ) was very rude because, even though I gave him ALL my personal information, I could not verify the account number because I no longer had the card ( I destroyed it back in XXXX ).

Two weeks later, I received a notice that my Citibank account was sold to a collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I called Citibank back about the pending dispute and they would not discuss it with me or confirm they had any record of my previous calls. I called XXXX 'XXXX Collection branch XXXX  and, once explaining my situation to the woman, she said she understood and would mark the case as a disputed claim and that I would get a follow up from them within 2-4 weeks with instructions as to how and where to submit the dispute information. Instead, I got another notice in XXXX asking "" how can we help '' you with a payment schedule. Another phone call, another explanation and another registering a dispute. XX/XX/XXXX, I get a letter from XXXX  with a copy of the Citibank letter saying they sold the account but nothing from Citibank referring to any dispute discussions I had with them. This is the first piece of mail or communication where I am actually privy to the account number that was assigned to me over a year ago. Finally my credit rating has been changed to "" in dispute '' but there should be no issues with my normally outstanding credit rating if not for this account. 
Issues : - I never authorized the use of this account anywhere in writing or with signature. 
-the credit card was never activated - XXXX ignored my request to NOT renew my XXXX account - XXXX renewed my membership without my approval on a credit card that was not activated - Citibank was no help in resolving the situation and "" sold '' my account to a collection agency within 1-2 weeks of receiving my call for a dispute resolution - Citibank refuses to talk to me about an account that no longer exists with them - Citibank refused my request for a transcript or even acknowledgement that our phone calls transpired even though "" this call may be monitored ...

Student loan,"Navient continues to send me emails about the payment they expect from me in XXXX. They claim that my school didn't report to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I logged into the database and it says that I am a full-time student. Therefore, there is no reason they should be sending me emails expecting payment. Their website gives you the run around when it comes to filing forms online and contacting them by email. They say if you log in you can email them. It becomes one giant circle of going around from page to page without finding the information you are entitled to. 

They keep everything under wraps and do not inform their customers of anything. This is predatory student lending or debt collection at this point. My student status was updated on XX/XX/2019. There is NO REASON they should be asking me for payment now. But they are and I'm sick to death of their terrible customer service and harassment. If they aren't doing their job and checking the database, then that's not my issue. Something needs to be done about this. They have helped my old school to rip people off, they took my money and I got nothing in return but they still have these loans. It's bad enough I have to go back to college to try and get where I should have been in the first place."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2018, I used the XXXX XXXX app to transfer {$200.00} from my XXXX XXXX checking account ( debit card ) to my sisters XXXX XXXX   account. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the transaction still shows pending. The recipient ( my sister ) has still not received the funds. We have made four phone calls to XXXXXXXX XXXX, each call taking between XXXX minutes to XXXX hours, and each time have been told it will be another XXXX hours for XXXX XXXX   engineering team to fix the problem in their system. Today, I was on the phone for XXXX minutes and was told yet again they are working to fix the problem but cant tell me when. In my mind, XXXX has stolen not only my money but also my time which is of even greater value at this point than the formentioned funds. XXXX XXXX needs to be shut down. They are misleading consumers and are not able to live up to their terms of agreement. After XXXX weeks, I label this as theft and fraud."
Debt collection,"Ms. XXXX called me XX/XX/XXXX, trying to collect a debt from XX/XX/XXXX. She would not verify herself, her company, and she did not verify me. She did not read the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' nor was i on a recorded line. If i was on a recorded line, she did not notify me. She told me I had ONE hour to pay. I told her I needed time and needed to research this before paying. She then somehow called my boss 's mobile phone, was rude to her, and this was extremely embarrassing to me at my place of work. When I called her back ( I called her on an XXXX number, she answered "" hello '', she did not answer with a business name ) to tell her it is illegal to contact my boss, and it is also illegal the way she handled the entire call. She became irate, unprofessional, and told me to "" quit stealing money and I should know better '' then she became threatening, and told me to "" just wait '' There are SEVERAL Fair Debt Collection Act violations in this scenario, and I can not find any information on "" XXXX XXXX '' there is also a XXXX number she has called from."
Student loan,"I attended XXXX XXXX University from the fall of XXXX to the spring of XXXX and graduated with a BS in XXXX XXXX. After graduation I accepted an industry position and began my new career in XXXX of XXXX. After an automatic deferment of six months on my loan repayment I entered an income-based repayment ( IBR ) plan that allowed me to make payments while supporting my wife and twin sons, all without incident. When it was time to renew my XXXX in XXXX I followed the same process but my payment status was left unresolved for several months despite regular attempts to contact the company to resolve the matter. By XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving notices that Navient required payment but would not accept my XXXX application with no explanation as to why there was an issue. By approximately XXXX of XXXX my IBR was approved and I began payments again, but Navient had placed XXXX day late payment marks on my credit report during the time that my payment plan was in process. I worked with the credit reporting agency and Navient to resolve the issue, and eventually Navient agreed that my lack of payment was due to process errors on their end, but for some reason they have only removed the marks for the 30 and 60 day late payments on my XXXX report. Please see the attached document showing a 90 day late payment in XX/XX/XXXX but ( document titled 'XXXX Navient Payment, ' red highlight from me ) but no payment issues on XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I have been unable to retrieve documents from either XXXX or Navient showing the previous status, but credit reports don't generally show a random 90 day late payment mark in an otherwise satisfactory payment history. I have contested the 90 day late payment several times with both XXXX and Navient, while the XXXX staff have been friendly they appear to be unable to do anything more than contact Navient as part of the dispute and receive a form letter that says that late payments have to be noted on credit reports. Please see the attached document labeled 'Navient Form Letter ' for the last of these letters I received from Navient while disputing on my credit report. That is literally all of the contact I have been able to document from their organization. At this point I can't even log into their system to find historical documents and can't receive customer assistance in any form."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","At the beginning of XX/XX/2019 I pulled all three credit reports and found two issues on them that tanked my credit score. One account is not even mine, the other was paid off and closed years ago. I first disputed on-line with no success. They returned results that stated "" all information correct and verified with reporting company ''. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don't open accounts on-line???!!! 
So I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX stating once again regarding the same account - "" Information verified with reporting agency '' and nothing more. That's it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to "" confirm '' that their information is correct, but don't they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!! What more can I do as a consumer to have this addressed/investigated properly??? 
The other account that I am disputing flat out refused to accept the letter that I sent them certified. Now what? I've filed written dispute as well on this response, but have not gotten a response yet from any of the Credit Bureaus. 
I need assistance immediately in addressing XXXX  and their investigation processes. Both these items need to be removed immediately as neither of them have provided any type of proof/verification of accounts."
Debt collection,"I have been contacted repeatedly by the company, Asset Recovery Services. They have informed me that if I do not pay the debt that they claim I owe then civil lawsuit action will take place.They claim that this debt is over seven years old and when I inform them that they can not legally sue me for this debt they become increasingly agitated and unprofessional. They have claimed that they will come to my place of business but have not stated their intentions for that. I have requested that all communication be in writing and to no longer call me and they have refused this request. I have attached an email, the only thing in writing that I have received so far. In this email our discussion is referenced and the term settlement is used. At no time did I admit to ownership of the debt nor did I agree to pay any amount."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have one existing Capital One Card. About 2 years ago, I called the credit card company and asked them to lower my Interest rate. I believe that my credit score was in the mid-700 's. At that time, I had two Capital One cards and had paid off these cards a few time with large sums of money paid. I believe that this company has been discriminating against me for some time. When they refused to lower the Interest rate the first time, I had that Bank canceled one of my cards. After I canceled that card, I began to get harassed by this bank in regards to my online activity where I would pay the amount owed. The Credit Card online account on numerous time had my password being changed, and I had to wait long periods to get it taken care of. I filed a Banking Complaint against them more than once. What can you do to assist me?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I once had a joint credit card with my now ex-husband ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) with XXXX   and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, PA. Per our marital settlement agreement filed in XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX County, PA, my name was to be removed from this account in some manner by him upon our divorce ( which was granted in XX/XX/XXXX ; see attachments ). Currently, my Equifax credit report shows this account as having closed in XX/XX/XXXX. However, I recently noticed that my credit scores dropped considerably, due to the creditor having reported a negative change in the account 's payment status and an increase in the balance. For example, per XXXX XXXX, my XXXX  decreased by 41 points on XX/XX/XXXX due solely to the increased balance of this account ( see attachment ). 

I filed a dispute about this information in early XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX. The first two credit reporting agencies have closed my dispute and have made no change to my report, claiming that the account information is correct. I simply don't understand how this is possible -- my name has been removed from this account per court order and the credit bureaus themselves all list this account as closed. I do not bear any responsibility for this account as of the date of my granted divorce decree, and yet both XXXX and Equifax have refused to remove this negative item from XX/XX/XXXX from my credit report."
Debt collection,"On or around XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from XXXX at C & M Associates claiming to be trying to collect a debt from a credit card from XXXX. I was threatened with a law suit, liens on my home and bank account. I got angry and he hung up on me. I felt bad so the next day I called this company back and spoke with a gentleman named XXXX XXXX I explained to him that I did not have the money to settle this debt, in the amount of XXXX, so I was offered a settlement amount of XXXX which I thought was something I could do given some time. XXXX asked me if I could pay XXXX and that would lock in the settlement amount, and that I would have until XX/XX/XXXX to pay the remaining balance of XXXX. I reluctantley gave him my checking account information, stating to him that I was not comfortable doing so, he promised me that no other monies would be taken out of my account without my ok. I was told that he would keep in touch to see where I was financially. I spoke with XXXX again on XX/XX/XXXX at which time I was thinking that I would have the money in the bank, but was not 100 % sure ... so he said he would call me the day before it was due, which would've been XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX had contacted me, at which time I told him that I did not have the money in my account, he informed that by not settling this case I would be sued, I would have a lien on my home, on my bank account ... and I told him that unfortunately I would have to take that chance I had not realized that they money had already been deducted from my account ... he acted as though he had no idea. On XX/XX/XXXX a deposit had been made into my account, which I was using for my mortgage payment. Low and behold that on XX/XX/XXXX I went to the ATM to make a small withdrawal, it was rejected stating there were insufficient funds, I then looked at my account on my phone and saw that on XX/XX/XXXX a payment of XXXX was withdrawn and sent to C & M Associates. I was livid, this left my account with XXXX in it, which in turn my house payment bounced. I called XXXX at C & M Associates and he told me that is what my agreement was, that I was told that the payment was due on the XXXX, and that I postdated the checking information for that day. I told him that I did no such thing, I told XXXX on the XXXX that I would not have the money for XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore they took the money out of my account without permission, they stole my money ... .I have tried to email them, but it comes back stating access denied ... ..I am at wits end. I have contacted the District Atttorney 's office in XXXX County. I have also filed a complaint with the XXXX ... ..I will pursue charges if forced too."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",OnXX/XX/2019 I pulled my XXXX  credit report. I noticed two collections on my report from a Phoenix Financial Group a collection agency claiming to be collecting for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. One was for {$160.00} and one was for {$160.00}. I was completely unaware of owing any of these two groups any money for any services provides. I disputed these on my credit report and on the next morning XX/XX/2019 I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they could not find anything on me owing them any money that had not been paid. I then contact Phoenix Financial Group and the lady insisted on me giving her my social security number. I was hesitant but she stated she could not look up anything with out it. So I did and she told me she could not find anything in her system that they had reported. I asked well why is there two collections on my credit report. She just stated on don't know. dispute it. I then asked her if she would send me an email that stated they have no collections reported on me. She stated send you an email that I have nothing in my system or in the office on you and I said yes. She just laughed and said she could not do that. Here is a group that is unconcerned that they have fraudulently posted a negative entry on someone's credit report and had no desire to correct the mistake.
Mortgage,"XXXX XXXX bought my mortgage and i can not log into my account through their website. I previously filed CFPB complaint number XXXX and received an inadequate response. It stated that since they can log into my account i can too and i don't have a problem. This is comical because i would hope a company servicing billions in home mortgages can log into their own software account ; however, just because they can log in doesn't mean i can. I have called the respondent o my complaint, XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX compliance department have have received no call back from multiple voice messages."
Student loan,"XXXX College is known as a scammer school that shut its doors on its students and left everyone in debt. 

I transferred out of XXXX College a year before it closed down due to the fact that I didnt believe they had given me the education they promised, they didnt train me properly, and they promised I would be finished in 2 years, which I absolutely wasnt. Nor was any of my peers. 

A year later they were shut down and I am stuck paying back {$100000.00} in student loan debt with no degree or certificate to show for it. I am struggling to make ends meet while still trying to get an education at a better school. 

I believe it is completely unfair that I was promised a good education by a scam school that eventually closed down and forgave the student loans of the students currently at the school. I was smart enough to leave to not accrue MORE debt, however, I am still paying back the loans caused by this school. 

I would like forgiveness of my loans from XXXX College or a giant percentage taken off at a better rate so I can pay back at least some and get this horrible school off my of record and off of my mind."

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XXXX XXXX I sent a wire for XXXX XXXX from my Wells Fargo bank in Georgia ref. numberXXXX to an agent who worked for XXXX XXXX XXXX who were sending a consignment ( to one XXXX XXXX ) from out of the country. The agents name was foreign sounding XXXX XXXX and I knew nothing about him except that I was to go through him for XXXX XXXX to get his consignment so XXXX XXXX could pay me back the previous loans he had gotten from me. The day the wire was sent it was confiscated by US Treasury Dept. specially the OFAC ( a terrorist division ). They have held the money since then. They demanded to know XXXX XXXX 's passport, id, etc on this man I was told worked for XXXX. I could tell them nothing. I have been making huge payments per mo. on this loan account numberXXXX of {$720.00}. and still owe over $ 30k. My bank told me I would get the money back with interest but it has not happened. They tell me they can not help me any further. I have written 6 letters and made calls to the XXXX but they do not respond. I need my money back so I can pay off this loan.

Mortgage,"My refinance took longer than expected. Flagstar charged me 3 times @ {$30.00} for payoff quotes that I did not request. To the extent I did request quotes, I did them by mail to avoid their excessive and unfair fax/electronic fees. My presumption is the request came from the title company, but Flagstar did not reach out to me prior to fulfilling the payoff request to gauge whether there was a rush need that required electronic versus mail. Instead, they fulfilled these electronically and charged me a fee. This is an unfair and deceptive practice when it is cheaper to generate electronic payoffs than it costs to mail. I have no way to prevent it from occurring as I am not the source of the request. Moreover, I wonder if Flagstar provides payoff figures to their internal sales team when their customers refinance with Flagstar rather than a competitor. 

In speaking with Flagstar, they were unconcerned with this practice and told me to take it up with the title company that incurred the costs on my behalf. 

Separately, I tried to reach Flagstar in XXXX to talk about Loss Draft funds related to Irma, but they'd switched insurance vendors. There was no one available to talk to me after repeated attempts. They took my number and never returned my calls."
Mortgage,"I took a refinance mortgage with Quicken Loans Inc on a condo unit I owned in XXXX about two years ago. I was making a payment of {$620.00} a month. On XX/XX/2019 I received an email notifying me that my taxes on that property were paid, which was odd because I always receive the bill from the City and pay my taxes. I contacted Quicken Loans via email and they told me that they received an undelivered mail from the city that prompted them to establish the escrow on my account and pay the taxes and also increase my monthly mortgage payment. I told them that bill must have crossed in the mail and I also told them that I went ahead and made the payment in full on the taxes on the city website. I provided them the receipts of the payment via email as asked them to removed the escrow as it will mess up my online banking. I provided them the contact number of the City of XXXX and told them that the clerk confirmed to me that Quicken could verify my payment with a phone call. All they need is the account number associated with the property. They got back to me and said they could not do this and the escrow will remain on my account because they have the right to establish it. I asked them to put my account in dispute and to provide me with the proof that they have the right to establish an escrow account and increase my monthly payment without my knowledge but they never did. I also ask them to provide me with the agency they use for arbitration but they got back to me and said there is no process to dispute this via arbitration or any other way. A few weeks later I started to receive late notices stating that I was delinquent on my loan even though I was making my regular $ XXXX monthly payment 30 days in advanced and I have never been late. This payment was automatically setup from my bank account to go 30 days before the due date and it is still going out every month. 
I tried several channels including calls, emails to try to resolve this issue but no one at Quicken seems to make any effort to resolve this issue. Quicken has been reporting me as delinquent every month since XX/XX/2019 because of the shortage from the escrow account they established. My credit score dropped more than 100 points when Quicken started to report me as delinquent. They also keep charging me every month a late payment and sending me notices of foreclosure on my condo."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I am an American expatriate living in XXXX XXXX and working for a XXXX XXXX XXXX. My employer recently changed direct deposit policies so that the balance of my monthly pay was sent directly to my XXXX bank account rather than my U.S. bank account. Knowing that this change was about to occur, I set-up international wire-transfer instructions with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ), and sent a test transfer to to XXXX XXXX, XXXX to ensure that my data was correct. Within 36 hours my test was successful and I was confident that I had provided proper information to the bank. When my salary was deposited into my XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX, I utilized the wire-transfer profile I had previously set-up and wired the balance of my salary to my Chase account. It is now XX/XX/XXXX and my wire still has not been deposited into my Chase account. I have contacted XXXX and paid for a trace on the transfer, which they performed and confirmed was received and acknowledged by Chase Bank. Chase Bank still denies any knowledge of the incoming transfer and my full monthly salary is still missing.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for the Chase Freedom Account online and I was approved. I received the card in the mail with instructions on how to verify the card. When I logged on to verify and activate the card, I was unable to do so. Instead I was told to call. I called several time each time connected overseas and no one knew why I could not activate my new card and told me to call back. I kept calling back. I still have no idea what is happening or why I can not activate the new card. One of the reps said something about the account being closed, but could not say why.

I am elderly and can't understand what these people are saying on the phone. They talk way to fast for me and they are not taking the time to listen or explain to me what is happening that I can't activate my card."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Apparently there is something negative on my Equifax report. I requested it at the XXXX and received XXXX and XXXX without any issues. There is nothing negative on either report. Equifax system was down and it said, basically, ask for one by mail. I logged in to the Equifax site the next day and requested it. It said "" we are unable to process your request at this time '' and gave me a phone number to call. I called the number and went through the prompts and received the email attached below. Notice that it says "" Equifax credit file failed {$0.00} ''. I then called two or three more numbers and the agents in each case said I had to wait until next year to attempt it again, however, they could provide me one right now for {$10.00}. They are running a complete scam over there. I haven't requested one of these in five years. I believe Equifax is deliberately making it impossible to get a free credit report in order to squeeze money from individuals."

For a number of reasons I believe this determination is unjust and inappropriate for my current financial situation and the current guidelines in place by XXXX XXXX to remove a cosigner. No where in the application does it state that I must have a certain dollar amount of income yearly to be approved for the cosigner to be removed, even with that being said I make a very decent amount of income for my age and debt- very easily making monthly payments. According the cosigner release form the guidelines to be met are of the following : I must complete the entire application, which I did. I must meet the age requirement of 18, which I have. Provide graduation completion documentation, which I did. Be a US Citizen, which I am and forever will be. Provide proof of income, I provided my recent pay stub along with my W2- with a very reasonable income. Be current on my service loans and with in the past 12 months, which I have been in repayment for over a year now and have never missed a payment. The next is demonstrated a satisfactory payment history for the last 12 months. And finally no student loans in hardship or forbearance, which I have never had. They did state they would run a credit report the support the fact that I will be able to assume full responsibility for repayment of loans and to make sure there are no signs of bankruptcy, open foreclosure, student loan default or delinquencies. So at meeting all these guidelines and applying, I had no concerns of having my application not being accepted. Then when I received the form on XX/XX/XXXX stating my income was unsatisfactory, I strongly disagreed. On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a form from transunion to dig further into why I may have  not been accepted. The same time I had called and spoke to XXXX XXXX about it and the representative told me that I had no grounds to dispute the subject. I am currently awaiting a response from TransUnion on the grounds that they used my old income to calculate the report versus the W2 I had submitted. I have a decent credit score and steady income, currently I have no assistance from the cosigner on my loans and am making payments in full."
Checking or savings account,"I open checking account in Citibank in XXXX and when I was opening the account I was told I need to have one direct deposit and one bill so I can avoid monthly XXXX $ fee and so I have setup my direct deposit and my bills. Recently I was reviewing my statements as saw Citibank is charging me monthly XXXX $ fee over a year at least from XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I was talking to a representative on Citi Mobile app 's chat and she told me my bill should be and I am quoting "" Qualified bill payment is Automated payment services that can be set up at financial institutions. The customer need provide the bank and company with debit information and bill are withdrawn automatically out of a checking account and reported monthly statements '' and I told her that exactly what I did and she said let me check and never responded, so called them and told I have a bill and direct deposit and they told me they have a policy of returning only last 60 day not more and it is my fault because I did not check my statements previously ( which is correct If I check my statements I would have noticed ), but that does not change a fact they charge me incorrectly and they are refusing to return it."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX XXXX prepaid card, you filling dispute and then realizing next day I will was wrong calling to withdraw my dispute I was told by Disputes Dept Rep and Supervisor it indeed was cancelled and my card would remain active. This was in XX/XX/19 On XX/XX/19 called customer Services at XXXX XXXX I wanted to know why my card and account was blocked and my XXXX benefits were for on this day to unblock the card. Find out they never cancelled the dispute as I asked, their the account was suspended and that I would have no access to funds until I received a new card. Explaining to them all if this was to be taken care of 1st time  in XX/XX/XXXX, I kept hearing from them they can't do nothing. Then after being persistent I was allowed to only withdraw XXXX as courtesy. But yet I was charged XXXX ATM fees, and they won't expite my new card unless I pay XXXX and they won't keep my original card open as I was told would happen several times."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I purchased the car in XXXX at a purchase price of less than $ 10K. XXXX repossessed the car in XXXX and reported to the credit bureaus that I owe a balance of more than $ 10K. The car was auctioned off in XXXX. There is no way that I owe over $ 10K on a car that I had for 5 years and the purchase price was under $ 10K. XXXX needs to provide the signed loan documentation with the purchase and interest agreement. The balance reported to the credit bureaus is inflated. The documentation provided to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a computer print out and does not prove the amount owed coincides with the loan documents I signed. XXXX also sent email payment confirmations to my email address that was a link to their site but I am unable to access payment receipts because my access to the account was removed.

I called the company to find out what this was about and they would not give me any information. They said I needed to send them his death certificate. I told them that I was not going to do this because I had no idea what this was even about and then they hung up on me.

Mortgage,"Recently I purchased a property and locked the loan through PNC Bank XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( Mortgage Loan Officer ) - NMLS ID : XXXX. I quoted the loan with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018 and he promised it can be closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought it is perfect timing because my lease ending date is XX/XX/2018. However, it is a mistake to decide to work with XXXX and XXXX. Their irresponsible promise and carelessness service made me into very stressful situation and caused me a loss of {$960.00}. 

Starting XX/XX/XXXX I begin to submit materials requested. The loan processor I worked with is XXXX XXXX, NMLS # XXXX. For any materials he requested, I submitted to him promptly. He promised the close date is XX/XX/2018 until XX/XX/2018, he told me because the confirmation of my XXXX status, he could only submit he project review on XX/XX/2018 and my loan would be delayed to be closed on XX/XX/2018. 

At that time, I already give notice to the landlord which means I must move into the property on XX/XX/2018. 

However, I trusted him I can still move into the property though it is inconvenient to me. In addition, my parents is visiting me from XXXX and we planned to be on vacations during holidays. 

After that, he kept on telling me everything is on track and we would be close on time until XX/XX/XXXX, he disappeared. He responded the next day and told me the bank wouldnt close the loan and the bank would not be responsible for any expense of hotel. He kept on lying to me he could cancel the loan or the loan would be close on this date and that date. 

Because his dereliction of duty, I have to pay {$120.00} a day to live in hotel for a total of {$960.00}. 

The delay ruined my entire holiday plan. I canceled the trips to south California because the loan wouldnt be closed. I would not go with PNC if they have told me the timeline in the first place. I think the whole practice is against UDAAP. 

Besides, XXXX promised to provide the project review copy but he did not. He again lied to me."
Debt collection,"I have been receiving threatening phone calls where the person impersonates a warrant officer.

Debt collection,"Zwicker & Associates did not notified me of a pending lawsuit until I was served papers. When I contacted them, I explained that the debt was business debt and not personal debit. The agent refused to listen and started threatening me with more legal action if I did not pay them. The amount they wanted way way out of what I could afford. They told me to quit paying my mortgage and to shut off utilities to give them what they wanted. I gave them money out of fear. I have since lost my house due to their tactics. 

They had no legal grounds to come after me personally for a debt under an LLC. They had no legal grounds to pierce the vale of limited liability. A quick search online will show the amount of complaints and unlawful tactics the firm uses to scare people into giving them money. 

I have also not received any notifications about payments being processed or that the debt is paid off, which it should be. This firm is out of control and using predatory and illegal tactics to scare people into paying them."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I put a security freeze on all three credit agencies. I needed to lift it temporarily, and had NO problem with XXXX  and XXXX. Experian, apparently, sent me a PIN number in the mail, which I do not recall receiving. I answered questions it asked online, but the company would not life my freeze and wants me to send in a copy of my drivers license, bills and other proof of who I am, and will not lift the freeze or allow me to use a verbal identification over the phone with SSN, former addresses, and other proof of identity. I'm ticked off, because they make is so difficult to lift my freeze and can not make it reasonable like the other two services. Meanwhile, because I can not get the freeze lifted, I'm losing {$600.00} by not having my credit approved in time. 

We have no choice to be able to remove them from our credit services. I'm frustrated and feel that they should be sued for restricting commerce."
Mortgage,We previously filed a complaint on this site requesting that Fifth Third Bank accept the short sale offer we had on our home. This was back in XX/XX/XXXX! Instead we have been caught in retention option XXXX. I have written emails to XXXX XXXX ( COO ) ; XXXX XXXX ( COB & CEO ) ; XXXX XXXX ( CFO ) and XXXX XXXX. The ONLY response I EVER received was from clerks who had no authority or power to make a REAL decision on our request. I was told this week by yet another clerk that my hardship application was discarded because the bank wants us to accept their retention proposal. We are NOT in the position to continue to pay this mortgage. Over this 10 year history we tried 8 times to refinance this mortgage. If they would have offered a serious retention option even 5 years ago we wouldnt be in this situation.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a credit card with Citi Bank that I would use at XXXX. I received by bill in the mail every month and promptly paid with a mailed check. In XX/XX/XXXX, I did not receive a bill and therefore did not notice until I received a telephone call in reference to collecting a bill. The company told me that I had agreed via email to online billing and should have paid the bill on line. I DID NOT agree to online billing, as it has caused me problems with two other companies in the past.

I told the company that if they would mail me a bill, i would pay for all items I had bought, but would not pay late fees or interest because I believe they fraudulently switched me to online billing. I then cancelled the credit card. 
I have since paid for all items bought, but have received two paper bills demanding late fees and interest, which i refuse to pay. 
The last two mornings, I have received two telephone messages demanding that I call them about this account. I will do so today, after filing this complaint"

The attached letter is dated XXXX. The letter goes on to say that if I pay this collection, the client will cease further collection efforts. This is a scam and a completely unsubstantiated collection. I have not now, nor in the past, used XXXX. I do not have a XXXX account. This attempt to collect a debt I do not owe could cause serious issues with my credit reporting. I have contacted Convergent to resolve this matter however, I have not been successful. I respectfully request that an inquiry into Convergent be launched and any collection proceeding against me be stopped immediately."
Student loan,"I have made several payments that have been deemed ineligible towards PSLF by fedloan servicing. Fedloan servicing has reported that there is "" No Bill Being Due. '' I completed a privacy act request and got all my loan records from Department of education from XXXX-current. I uploaded these documents which showed that I made the payments and they were processed by the previous loan servicer. Fedloan servicing said that they reviewed the documents on XX/XX/2021 and closed the case without adjusting the count. Additionally some of the dates that say "" no bill being due '' were times when my loan was being transferred between servicers or my annual IBR payment was being recalculated. Is the phrase "" no bill being due '' a catch all for payments that the servicer can't figure out because of poor record keeping? Additionally, just because a bill was not generated does not mean that those payments don't count. Currently during covid-19, bills are not being generated and the monthly payments are counting as long as we are employed in XXXX XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I just received a denial letter from XXXX XXXX. I called to discuss the reason for denial with the bank. I was told there are 2 negative items on my XXXX credit report that determined there decision. The first item is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have disputed this with XXXX and transunion and it has since been rectified and deleted however XXXX is still reporting it. I have stated many times I had multiple loans with XXXX that were all paid in full. They were combined loans and it has been satisfied. This has been an ongoing issue over 2 years now. The next item was XXXX XXXX XXXX that as well has been deleted and removed off XXXX but is showing on XXXX. There were numerous fraudulent charges on that credit card. I have reported it to police over 4 years ago. I tried contacting XXXX by phone to discuss this and dispute it again but I cant speak to a live person.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/2018 I contacted Bank of America to pay the balance on my credit card and close the credit card account. The reason I gave BOA for closing the account was that I no longer used the card. XX/XX/2018 a charge occured on the card for an annual magazine subscription. XX/XX/2018, BOA shows a 30 day late payment on the account. XX/XX/2018 BOA, shows a 60 day late payment on the account for all 3 credit reports for both myself and my wife. 

I have kindly asked BOA to remove the late payments from all of my credit reports and my wife 's credit reports. I paid the disputed charges ( {$77.00} ) plus interest despite the fact that the account should not have been active or open for such charge. 

My family is facing financial penalty and hardship due to a BOA error concerning {$77.00}. I believe BOA has made some effort to resolve the issue but upon speaking with XXXX this morning it is obvious they have not reached out to all parties.

I am still 3years later not able to write the interest off on my taxes continuously see years worth of fees being allocated to me fraudulently!

Credit card or prepaid card,"My husband and I traveled on a XXXX XXXX cruise in XX/XX/2018. Based on a program offering 12 months of no interest, we purchased two fairly expensive watches from XXXX XXXX, a company based in New York. We were informed that as long as we made 12 equal payments on time no interest would be charged. I made every single payment on time as agreed. My last payment was made in XXXX and was only {$26.00} because we had paid so much down already. I was shocked to receive a bill in the mail for all interest that would've been due had I not made any payments. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the day I receive the bill to figure out why I am being charged. They basically explained that even though the last payment of {$26.00} was not due until several days after it was received ( I paid it before the due date ), the 12 months no interest program expired a few days before the payment was actually due. So basically I got charged over {$570.00} for a {$26.00} final payment that was paid early. I have excellent credit and strive to always pay my bills on time. I have never filed a complaint or had an issue with a 12 month no interest arrangement. This was extremely deceptive.

They charge more than 300 percent in interest which is against the law to the consumer regarding a loan. Ally Bank acted like they were going to refund my money did a dispute and no money was received lost over {$2300.00} in unauthorized charged which I called the bank and advised them."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Under Rule 5000 FDIC guidelines, a debt can be classified under two options, standard and sub-standard. Sub-standard debts are debts placed into a charge off status, and that takes place on secured debts as posting for 180 days late. As this dispute proves, the dent showing as a charge off status has never been more that 60-days late. Accordingly, the charge off status is fraudulent, and must be removed. XXXX XXXX XXXX has an obligation under its subscriber agreement with the three major credit bureaus to abide by the rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the guidelines under the FDIC Act, which gives strict guidelines pertaining to sub-standard debts and charge off status requirements. The charge off status must be deleted permanently."

This took about 2 plus weeks. 
How could my NEW mortgage company not know my address. I recently sent the re-issued check and I need it signed immediately so I can pay the contractor that fixed my roof.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There are two issues with XXXX XXXX on my report that are concerning.

First, I was a customer of XXXX XXXX   and I see that they pulled a report in XX/XX/XXXX. I was a customer for a few months but they were new in Montana and they service was sketchy, they promised to port my number ( business phone ) and could not for many months. the is a note attached to that activity : Permissible Purpose : XXXX XXXX XXXX/written authorization/investig fraud. I feel this is very strange and I did not authorize this nor did I commit fraud. I feel this is a negative commentary that I don't deserve.

about 6 weeks ago, I received a box from XXXX XXXX and opened it to find that XXXX XXXX had sent me 2 brand new in the box XXXX XXXX. I did not order, I was not a customer of XXXX, and I did not really know what to do.

I called XXXX but they kept asking for my SSN -- and since I have no way of knowing to whom I am speaking, I did not provide it, and they can't find an account by my name or address ( again, I am not a customer ) I took both phones to XXXX  in XXXX. I asked for the manager XXXX, and he helped me, he took both phones and sent them back. I have copies mailing documents that XXXX said indicated acceptance of the phones. I also have a recording of the entire conversation between XXXX, XXXX, and myself on the day I returned the phones. XXXX said it was the 4th set of phones returned in the same manner.

Today, I got a letter from XXXX  Reference Number : XXXX  saying [ dated XX/XX/XXXX] about the time that I that I was not approved for a phone in accordance with a recent credit pull ( I never requested it ) and I am concerned about this repeated activity and no assurance that XXXX is taking this seriously nor acting on my behalf. And, seemingly, they appear to be making my credit report with negative commentary. This is not fair to me.

Please note that the identifying information they provided in the XXXX  request on XX/XX/XXXXhas my name and address but the number is not mine. Never was mine, and is an apparent indicator of fraud and a possible link to the perp.

Furthermore, I believe XXXX  sold me phone that had a number from Idaho originally and that the phone was not new as it should have been. Why eles would there be a XXXX number assigned to it?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have reviewed my credit report and noticed that my name was misspelled, have incorrect addresses and inaccurate accounts. I have sent out numerous disputes to remove this inaccurate information and accounts on my credit report. Please remove this inaccurate information and accounts that can not be verified. 

Here are the following date disputes was sent, XX/XX/2021."
Student loan,"I consolidated with XXXX XXXX in XXXX to take advantage of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) plan, when I realized that I was not eligible for this benefit while my loans were with XXXX XXXX. ( I have worked for the same non-profit 501 ( c ) 3 organization since XXXX. ) As soon as I learned of the PLSF program, I aimed to learn the rules of the plan and submitted all of my paperwork in XX/XX/XXXX to consolidate from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX was terrible about communicating the rules of the program, but I did my research online and followed the guidelines. After making two payments under the standard repayment plan, I read online that only income-based repayments are eligible for PLSF. I submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX for IBR, which took months to process, and I got on the IBR plan beginning XX/XX/XXXX. My loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX ( now defunct ) to XXXX in XXXX, and then to Fed Loan in XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that my payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF )  program were miscounted, resulting in approximately 16 missing payments from my eligible payment count. I have tried for months to work with FedLoan Servicing to rectify this issue, but I am very unhappy with the progress of this review. I have asked repeatedly, both by email and phone, for a full history of the student loan payments I've made to all 3 servicers. Both the Department of Education Ombudsman Group and Fed Loan verbally confirmed the payments I made over the telephone, but they refuse to submit this to me in writing. Fedloan has sent me 3 different cryptic, disorganized documents that do not in any way show a full payment history, and they truly lack any semblance of reason. One document had transaction codes with no legend/key for the codes and 50-75 different transactions, many in the amount of {$0.00} or other random small amounts. This is completely unacceptable service for a student loan company to offer a borrower. 

Furthermore, FedLoan has advised me that nearly a year of payments I made in XXXX cant be counted toward PSLF because I was on an "" administrative forbearance '' at this time. I have proof that I was billed during this time, made hefty monthly payments, and I did not request any type of forbearance on my account for those months. I would have never made the financially crippling payments if they weren't being counted toward my loan program! This is obviously an administrative error and must be corrected. 

Fedloan has also advised me that some payments I made could not be counted toward PSLF because my payment was one cent off from the actual amount due. I have sent them records showing that my monthly amount due was indeed the amount I paid. A few other payments were a XXXX or a few dollars off because I paid a few dollars extra on a month prior when I would sometimes round up to the nearest dollar when making a payment. Beyond this, there were several other payments that Fedloan says do not count towards the PSLF program for one unfair reason or another. I work in public service, and I have struggled to make these payments. I've paid around {$30000.00} of interest only payments to date. My original loan balance was around {$47000.00} ... with compounding interest each month, my balance has increased to {$60000.00}. My only hope for ever ending this overwhelming debt is the PSLF program. Fedloan is making unfair, inhumane decisions with regard to PLSF and it is very evident that they've grossly mismanaged my student loans. I have never made a late payment and have held up my end of the contract as the consumer. Fedloan has breached the contract with me, the loan holder, by not keeping proper records of my payment eligibility, and by never informing me that being paid ahead by even a XXXX could affect my status. ( This information is buried on their website, but in the emails I get each month about my bill it actually gives encouraging tips about paying ahead! ) Furthermore, it is completely unacceptable to not fulfill my request for a full payment history in 3 months time when I am currently making monthly payments in the amount of over {$410.00} to this company! 

I have followed the PSLF program to the letter, frequently certifying my employment for the program. Ive read online about people who werent with the right loan servicer for PSLF, or in the wrong payment plan for years and who are now upset that their payments dont count and have appealed for inclusion in the program. Meanwhile, I did my research and properly followed the program, only to have XXXX instruction or accountability from XXXX XXXX and then my payments mishandled and incorrectly counted by FedLoan! This program is supposed to reward people for work in the public sector. Its become a cryptic, unfair game that is impossible to navigate and has resulted in an insurmountable level of debt! I have a young son, and our entire future rests on me completing this program as soon as possible. I have already been working with the FedLoan Ombudsman group for 3 months. The staff is abrasive and unsympathetic. Please help me rectify this injustice and help me communicate with this organization."
Mortgage,"3-4 years ago my mortgage was sold by XXXX to a company called Seterus. Since then I have so many payment problems. My bank has sent them a mortgage payment 2x,  both occasions the payment was never received!! I get hit immediately with penalties. I have paid several times through their online payment system, again these payments failed and I got hit by penalties. Always penalties. The only way to pay my mortgage is to actually call them up every month and authorise same day debit from my account. Always so many extra fees ... I have reached out through social media and found hundreds of people suffering the same way. 

We now realise that Seterus are scammers, just looking to frustrate mortgage holders to screw extra fees every month. This is a consumer racket, and the public is being fleeced. I am a member of this XXXX page - https : XXXX. Please investigate them, they are fraudsters"
Mortgage,"The complaint I have is two fold. I am currently trying to save my home BECAUSE I was connected with a Mortgage broker who had me sign papers but never explained to me how the XXXX renovation process went. Everyone I worked with redirected to someone else. I have emails upon emails regard people telling me to go to different people up until this point I have been told that I don't qualify for a modification because I have only been in my property under a year. I will be calling and writing Washington BECAUSE what has happened to me is CRIMINAL and I WONT lose my home due to negligence. I have phone conversations, emails and texts of me asking for help or trying to understand the process all on my own. My ISSUE is I was told that there was assistane to help cover my living expenses during the XXXX process but I was NEVER told the request for these funds needs to be included in the work scope prior to closing. I am in a financial crisis now which partly my fault because I tried my best to handle this on my own. I havr maxed out ALL my credit cards. My credit is ruined and as a result of late fees and insurance increasing I can't afford to pay my mortgage. I'm in the process of applying for the HOME SAVER Grant and I really hope they can help me. But never the less this issue that I'm now in partly has to do with how I was TREATED during and after the mortgage/closing process. I signed documents and asked more then one time for help before deadline approached and was advised that everything was ok. I would like to see if you could offer any assistance with this matter before I move up the chain of command. On my part I have waited a long time with the hope of trying to resolve this on myself and I should have NEVER done that. I'm now facing losing my home and I have not even been there a year. It's sad and stressful but I know someone can help me I just have to keep looking and writing and start to hold people accountable ( this includes me ) for there actions. Please help me save my home."

Mortgage,"I refinanced my home loan with NationStar XX/XX/XXXX. Upon closing, without notifying me or bringing it to my attention they removed my Flood insurance from my escrow account ** ( per CFPB they have to disclose this information at closing. They never did ). In XX/XX/XXXX my flood insurance was due and did not get paid. I received notice of cancellation and immediately called Nationstar. They told me it was not a part of my escrow and if i wanted them to pay it I needed to talk to the escrow dept. So they transferred me to Escrow. I asked for them to pay my flood insurance and they said they would. * ( this didn't go smoothly there was a lot of back and forth ). Two months later my flood policy was cancelled due to non payment. Then I received a letter from Nationstar telling me they purchased lender placed Flood Insurance for me, which was 3 times the amount of my policy thru XXXX. According to my research with CFPB Subject to the requirements of 1024.37 ( c ) ( 1 ) ( i ) through ( iii ), if not prohibited by State or other applicable law, a servicer may charge a borrower for force-placed insurance the servicer purchased, retroactive to the first day of any period of time in which the borrower did not have hazard insurance in place. I had my insurance they spoke to XXXX. I could not believe it I lost my Grandfathered rate which was {$1400.00} annually and now my insurance is over {$3700.00}. This mess has made my escrow account so low that it has raised my monthly payments over {$500.00} a month.so high. I am a single mom with XXXX growing children. This was not in my budget. I fell behind when my payments went up and by XXXX XXXX  my home was in Foreclosure.

With the help of 1 agent who actually listened to me and started to dig into my account I was finally able to breath. She escalated it to her supervisor and who eventually my account was with Customer Relations VP and I thought I was finally going to get this resolved. By XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed me a deal where Nationstar dba MrCooper was going to offer me a modification where I still have to take the hit. and my payment was still over {$1500.00}. WHAT how is that helping me. Then I turned to CFPB and an attorney and that is when they offered to pay me the difference on my flood insurance policy for 5 years which is over {$11000.00} and they would modify my loan doing a partial claim. ( still don't know why I am having to take the hit ) and my payment was down to {$1200.00}. But that does not include Flood insurance. I wanted to think about it this was a big deal to me and I was so confused ( still am ). I reached out and called MrCooper to talk about the offer and the agent I spoke to had no clue what I was talking about he just kept telling me I had to either pay the Trial payment or I needed to pay over {$19000.00} and bring my account current. I sent a request to have my credit fixed and that was denied. No help at all in fact it made me so angry because I felt lied to i felt like I had been taken advantage of and scammed. Every time i spoke to someone it was something different but no one knew about the deal XXXX had offered me. I was so angry how could this still be going on.

With fear that I was not going to have a home I decided I would take the offer. I called and they said no sorry you did not accept the offer it has been denied. So I tried for a modification and i was denied since I did not take the last offer.

How is this okay. How can anyone expect me to trust this offer without getting answers to my questions and after I have been to XXXX  and back 5 times over. I have lost all good standing on my credit. My credit card limits gone. Credit cards cancelled. Phone calls, flyers about bankruptcy and foreclosure. I have not been able to eat, sleep, I have even started to see a counselor for my anxiety. All I am asking is for anyone reading this is to take a minute and think about what you would be feeling if this happened to you I never imagined this could ever happen. I thought with a phone call I could get this fixed its been 2 years I have lived this nightmare. I need someone to realize this is not easy for me to write this, I don't like conflict and I certainly don't know what else to do. I don't have money to keep paying a lawyer. Which it seems you have to do in order for big companies to actually listen. PLEASE HELP ME!!!!!!!!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Several issues here : Issue # 1 : I submitted payments latest one being XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$1500.00} to Discover via the android app. My payment was taken from my bank and applied to the card but the card did not reflect the payment. I called discover to inquire about this and they said they had to "" call the bank for verification the funds were sent '', I have an outstanding payment history with Discover and have NEVER missed a single payment. I use my credit cards to avoid Fraud potential issues on my bank card. When they lock my card down for 8 days ( to call the bank ) it creates hardships as I am scared to use my bank card at gas pumps. I have never heard of a company having to call the bank to get fund transfer verification. This has happened twice now both consecutively. They refuse to unlock the paid amount with the first tech and I always have to ask for a supervisor. I have NEVER seen any credit card company do this. This happened previously in XXXX, after 4 days I had to contact Discover to find out why my card was still locked, I was NOT waiting that long this time. If the money cleared my bank the funds should be available. 

Issue # 2 : When I originally opened this card with Discover it was secured due to poor credit history from my ex-wife. I was told my card would graduate in 7 months if I had a great payment history which I do. on the 7th month I called in to see if it graduated, I was told the initial graduation was 8 months. I called in XX/XX/XXXX which was the 8th month, they told me it was 7 months and did not graduate. I have made every single payment, sometimes 2-3 a month on the card, it has been 10 months and I am still on a secured card. I see many complaints online in regards to them not releasing deposits back to people but still qualifying them for a {$5000.00} un-secured card. When I inquired about paying off my account and closing it I was told it would be 70 days until my deposit would be refunded. If I have the account paid in full, deactivated where no more charges can hit it and I met my contract obligation my deposit should be released immediately ( yes I know it could take a couple of weeks to write a check and mail it ) but they are refusing. I feel like this is fraudulent actions on Discovers part as I was not notified of these things during the initial setup of my account.

I asked for a corporate number to Discover and was denied such rights. The customer retention department was very short and did NOTHING to calm the situation except offer to cancel my account as they said they were sorry to see me go ..."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX City/ State/ Zip : XXXX, DE XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXXXXXXXXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). 

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in theXX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at XXXX. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. 

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s.

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. 

I intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. 


I look forward to hearing from you, Thank you."

This process started back in XXXX with a simple request of a Loan Modification due to the fact that I was facing a Hardship.At the moment of my Hardship, I advise Select Portfolio with help because my company was experiencing an extreme Hardship and I could no longer afford my payments. To make matters worst, my husband, became XXXX and was forced to retired. His income no longer became available to the house and forced us to stop making payments. After being reviewed from XXXX to XXXX, they finally agreed to approved me with a trial payments that started from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. When I was approved, I had a problem with the second payment which they could not withdraw on time but they did not tell me anything about it until XXXX. In XXXX, a representative told me if I send both XXXX and XXXX payment together, I can comply with the trial. On XX/XX/XXXX, I executed the payment. Once the payment was withdrawn from SPS, they decided to send me a denial letter that they denied me the Loan Modification based on the fact that payments were not received on time. I feel like I was scammed by SPS by them advising to send the payments and then decide to deny me once they receive those payments. Thats when the real problem began. Ever since that denial, SPS has reopen many times a Loan Modification and then Denied me because the Investor XXXX XXXX   XXXX XXXX advises they dont want to move forward with the Loan Modification. Then they send me a letter stating they can help save the house, we reopen a case and month later they denied the Loan Modification based on investor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX denying the Loan Modification. They have done the same process for about 5 times. I dont understand how a company can reopen the case, send me letters that we would like to help you save your house through a Loan Modification, and then deny the process. Until last year, they approved me for a repayment plan. The approved me on a balance to be paid back Monthly of over {$5000.00} a month. If they knew that I could not afford this, specially since my previous payment was {$2400.00}, how did they expected me that this would be better. they mentioned that's what the investor approved me on, or else sell the house in a short sale. I could not afford this and the approval was denied. This year, I decided to see if I can even tried to get a repayment plan but just lowered because I want to save my house from Foreclosure, and they advise of a denial that Investor does not want to participate in any program, only a short sale.This is just not fair for me because I been fighting this case for the past 9 years and I feel like no resolution from SPS has been accomplished. I really want to save my house in a loan modification, I do not want to sell my house nor do a foreclosure against my property but I need your help"

We started to fall behind on our mortgage is XX/XX/2017. During this time we faced a tragedy. My husbands father was kidnapped and XXXX XXXX going into XXXX. We had to fly to Texas which is where his mom and sisters live to help them through this difficult time. He was found one month later in the XXXX XXXX desert XXXX and XXXX. Being the oldest we had to help his mom and sisters get through this tough time, helping them get back on their feet and paying for the funeral expenses as well as other miscellaneous things. Coming back home was tough, we came back to bills piling up. Trying to provide for our daughters while continuing daily life and catching u with everything else, to say it was difficult is an understatement. We had been trying to come up with the funds once the NOD was submitted but we found ourselves in a much deeper hole than we anticipated. During the time we were first trying to reinstate I was diagnosed with reoccuing XXXX XXXX. Our lives went from what we thought was tough to what we are faced with now. I am still currently undergoing treatment but despite that our goal was to reinstate our home, in case anything happened to me my daughters would at least have a roof over their heads. We set up a XXXX page where we were able to raise {$43000.00} and I was able to get a {$6000.00} loan from a relative. A few days before the sale I requested a reinstatement quote so that we could see how far off we were. They stated that they could not provide one because it was tooo close to the sale date. I continued to try to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX but they refused to speak to me. The day before the sale I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX  in hopes to postpone the sale as the funds from the XXXX page where not readily available in my bank account but would be within 14 Days. XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to postpone the sale. I once again asked for a reinstatement quote which they finally provided on XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX the day before the sale. The day of the sale we were persistant in trying to postpone the sale, but even after showing them that the funds would be available soon they went forward with the sale. Today it has come to my attention that the 3rd party buyer was a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, well I looked them up and it just so happens that their DBA is XXXX XXXX XXXX.our lender. That to me seems lik, e a conflict of interest and something that needs to be looked into. They sold it for exactly what was owed and now they can evict us and make a profit on it.

Mortgage,"Our mortgage is serviced by Ditech ( ditech.com ).

We carry a flood insurance policy on our home voluntarily. We are not required to carry flood insurance as part of our loan agreement.

When FEMA issued us a new flood insurance statement this year, they also sent a copy to Ditech. We are listed as the payer if we choose to pay for flood insurance. Ditech took it upon themselves to add the optional flood insurance policy to our escrow account, making it no longer optional.

I spoke to the flood insurance program on XX/XX/XXXX to ask if Ditech had the right to add the policy to my escrow and pay it automatically without my consent. I was told that Ditech is not listed as a payer on the policy and they only received a copy of the statement.

I spoke to Ditech on XX/XX/XXXX to request them remove the flood insurance policy and under no circumstances pay it, that we are the payer of the policy and we would pay for it directly if we decided to renew. I was told by Ditech that I had to fax them a letter stating I wanted it removed, because it was the law that if they received a statement for insurance they had to pay it.

I faxed them the requested letter on XX/XX/XXXX to the two fax numbers provided by Ditech. I followed up with Ditech on XX/XX/XXXXand was told they did receive the letter but it takes up to 10 days to process the request.

The next day the wired a payment for the flood insurance in the amount of {$2200.00} making my escrow account go into the negative that amount. By this point I had already renewed my flood insurance policy for a lower amount. I contacted the flood insurance program again and was told that they would not issue the policy twice so any payment Ditech sent would not be accepted.

I contacted Ditech back and told them that they sent that payment after I requested that they remove the account from my escrow, that they had no right to make the payment in first place, and they even sent the wrong amount. Their response was ... tough if the payment gets returned to them then they would credit my escrow account back.

Status as of XX/XX/XXXX, my escrow account is still negative from the {$2200.00} wire and the flood insurance policy is still listed on my escrow, now updated to be paid again next year and again for the wrong amount.

Our escrow is scheduled to be recalculated in XXXX  and this issue is going to become a lot bigger if it is recalculated before our escrow account is credited back the {$2200.00} that should have never been sent out in the first place.

By Ditech putting the flood insurance policy into our escrow and paying it without our consent, they are effectively making a voluntary insurance policy and non-voluntary insurance policy.

Ditech has been no help, they just send you from on department to the next without changing anything."

To have received my first notice that anything was amiss 20 months (! ) after the increase in payments began strikes me as ridiculous. While I am upset about the increased payments which I did not know about ( made worse by the fact that I spoke to US Bank numerous times before I had to register my car in Massachusetts in XX/XX/XXXX as I needed several documents from them to register the car and they never mentioned anything about the increase in payments ) I am much more angry about that fact that by sending a delinquency notice US Bank has negatively and quite unfairly impacted my credit score. It is  clear from the fact I sent every one of my XXXX lease checks to date on time that the only reason I did not pay the incremental {$50.00} amount is because I was not aware of the increase in the first place. 

US Bank 's actions appear to be a sorry attempt to extract late fees and interest from me at the last minute before my lease expires. Worse, they have no compunction about hurting my credit score on the way to doing so. I am writing the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to assist me in getting this demerit off of my credit report. My account number with US Bank is XXXX. Thank you, XXXX XXXX"
Vehicle loan or lease,"I bought a car from buy here pay here, I paid on the car for so long and was on time and they seen that I was a great creditor always paid on time and sometimes more, I was told that my long was being turned over to a bank, so I signed the papers thinking that that would help my credit but it was turned over to a finance company, my interest rate went sky High and turn to a upside down loan on the vehicle, then the vehicle was no longer drivable, as long as I was with the company they would fix it because they wanted their money, but once I was on my own with the finance company, I was stuck with a used vehicle that had been bought from an auction, It finally costed me a little over {$1400.00} to fix it and it costed me {$1400.00} to pay it off, so I requested that they come and secure their property there was no way that I could fix the vehicle and make payments at the same time so the best thing for me to do was to ( surrender ) relinquish the vehicle, they sold the vehicle for {$300.00}, I had {$800.00} worth of tires on the vehicle because I kept the maintenance up I want to road ready, brand new starter, brand new battery, all the whole works brand new rims, brand new rotors all the way around, they never contacted me to negotiate how we could resolve the issue they just sold the vehicle and I was stuck with the balance and I didn't sign up for my vehicle to be sold to a finance company I thought I was with a bank and I would have went the whole 100 with them."

I told him I have a limit of {$800.00} to pay for the repairs and wanted a written estimate 'before any work was to be completed. Instead, the owner went ahead and done the work "" without prior authorization according to Florida Statute when a written estimate is asked by consumer ( me ). I received a phone call from the owner stating the repairs was done and the bill was fraudulently written to cover the {$800.00} limit. By me stating I had a {$800.00} limit "" doesn't give authorization for the work that wasn't authorized by my signature or no document was signed by me giving my authorization of any repair that amounted to exactly {$800.00}. I wasn't given any written estimate or document from the owner that gave him permission to do work that amounted to the {$800.00} the owner stated I owed when I went to the shop to get my van. Instead, I had to pay the full amount {$800.00} ( {$500.00} on bank card wells Fargo ) and {$300.00} in cash which I had to withdraw from my checking account. Otherwise the owner would impound my vehicle until the {$800.00} was paid in full. I only had a {$500.00} daily limit on charges with my bank card and had to swipe the debit card from my checking account. Then pay {$300.00} cash in order to get my van released. There was no documentation presented to Wells Fargo Bank from XXXX XXXX XXXX  owner "" XXXX '' to prove I authorized the repairs made on XX/XX/XXXX, nor was a written estimate was provided by the owner "" as requested by me which all consumers have a right under Florida Statute "" to receive a written estimate prior to any work being performed by any licensed automotive repair facility. This repair shop violated this right that is guaranteed by Fla. Stat. When I file my dispute, "" I could only dispute the {$500.00} charged to my debit card, "" because the {$300.00} was paid in cash.

Then the argument I had to pay the unauthorized charges in order to get my van out of impound "" so i can return to work. The van was used for business and was necessary to keep working. I submitted complaints with Wells Fargo and the XXXX XXXX XXXX based on fraud charges and not following state statute which Wells Fargo refused to submit a proper complaint with Visa so they can do a proper investigation of my claims.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/19 I purchased 2 plane tickets on the American Express Travel web site using all the American Express loyalty points I had available ( XXXX points ). The purchase with the points was confirmed ( see attachment ). I had contacted American Express Travel after the purchase to ask when the points will be applied because they were not immediately removed from my points balance. The rep stated that it could take a few days before the points are applied. 

On XX/XX/19 ( 20 days later ), I noticed that American Express had taken the next payment scheduled from my checking account and it included the full amount of the plane tickets that were paid with the points. 

On XX/XX/19 I called American Express and explained the problem, the rep had to transfer me to another rep at American Express Travel. I was transferred and explained the problem to the new rep. I was placed on hold for some time ( about 1 hour ) while that rep was following up on the issue. Eventually she came back and stated that there was an internal error applying the points and that I had to be transferred to a supervisor to rectify the problem. I was then placed on hold for some time and after a while the rep stated that I can continue to wait or get a call back. I agreed to the call back, but I never got a call back. 

I called American Express Travel that evening XXXX XX/XX/19 XXXX and had to start over explaining the situation to a new rep. I was then told that I again needed to be transferred to a supervisor. The rep took my call back phone number in case I got disconnected. I was then placed on hold for a long time ( over 40 minutes ) and no answer. I had to hang up because I had an appointment to go to. I never got a call back. 

I called American Express Travel again on the morning of XX/XX/19. I got a new rep who again took my call back number and after I explained my situation, he proceeded to transfer me to a supervisor. Again, no answer after waiting on hold for 45 minutes. I had to hang up. No call back. 

I am certain you would agree that I should not keep calling to get nowhere, I have attempted three times already. This is why I am filing a complaint. I had decided to book my plane tickets with American Express Travel in order to use my points. I even paid more for the tickets ( about {$200.00} more ) than if I had booked them with another agency. Not only did American Express fail to use my points ( even though I have a confirmation ), they proceeded to take the funds from my checking account for the full amount of the tickets.

The Corporation has a good XXXX and XXXX and Capital One without authorization or notification pulled a personal credit file. 

Furthermore this hard pull was completely unnecessary as I have been a customer of theirs for over 4 years. They could have just as easily seen that i have NEVER had a late payment. They could have done a soft pull to satisfy their own curiosity if needed I need to reiterate this was a Credit Card issued to a business. A corporation and not an individual by any means. I did not sign a personal guarantee. 

There was absolutely no justified reason that this should have happened.

I never got any bills from XXXX, I called them and they admitted that the bills were coming back 'undeliverable '. Yes - I have no mailbox there. So they sold the debt which went from {$51.00} XX/XX/XXXX to {$320.00} in XX/XX/XXXX ( late fees, etc. I suppose ). So I found this out in early XXXX and filed a dispute with XXXX. I also contacted XXXX, which I am a member. I got no where. I contacted Resurgent on XX/XX/XXXX and they sent me an affidavit, which I promptly signed/notarized and sent back.

Ive called once a week and have been told the investigation is pending. No one has ever called or emailed me to investigate the case. Please note : when Barclays paid my XXXX card balance off twice they put my new Barclays card almost {$15000.00} over the limit. Why would they allow my new card to go over its limit? Why would I request a payoff of over {$29000.00} on the XXXX card when the balance was under {$14000.00}? In addition to being charged an erroneous fee of {$260.00} due to their error, Ive also been unable to use the card because its so high over the limit.

Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/2019 I logged into my credit card online account and scheduled a single payment for XXXX dollars. Two listings in the scheduled payments queue appeared. Each listed scheduled payment as the ability to click on it individually and cancel it. I intended to cancel one of the two scheduled payments, with no explanation of why the two listings appeared after only one payment was scheduled in the first place. Both listings of the scheduled payments disappeared. This left me with no scheduled payments pending and I was left to again may a second attempt to enter a scheduled payment. Again two separate listings appeared, this account was rather new to me and I made the determination this must be how the website lists a payment schedule in its pending payments section so I tried to make no further attempts to fix this. I had faith only one payment would process and this is just a programing graphic glitch. The next day two payments processed to my original concerns. I called the credit card company immediately and was told that one of the two identical  payments would be refunded in 24 hours, Saturday. No refund appeared and I checked again on Monday with nothing having taken effect. I called again and was told the last agent I spoken to on Friday was very incorrect and it would take three weeks. I told the agent that was way too long to wait for US Bank to correct their programming error and get back my XXXX dollars. I was then told I can call my own bank to contact US Bank to expedite this, then I asked what information do I need to refer to my bank so they knew how to proceed. I was placed on hold for a long time and then told to forget that original set of instructions. That there was no need to contact my bank because that is not part of their internal processes. I would just have to wait three weeks as originally told before being placed on hold. I told them I wanted to cancel my card and make payments on the balance for the rest of the term that I had an introductory zero APR. I was told if I pursued canceling my credit card that my introductory zero APR would end. I complained that US Bank really made some huge mistakes beginning with their website and their process for fixing them. I was told if there was nothing else they were going to end the call on me.

We sent the individual the payment in full through XXXX directly from the Chase Mobile app. The individual confirmed that they got the payment and even followed up with asking for us to pay for a "" COVID Crate '' for the puppy to travel in on the flight.

When reached out to Chase I was told that this type of transaction is not protected and that I the only thing that could be done is ask for a "" Courtesy Refund '' which basically requests a payment reversal through XXXX, but the scammer has no obligation to accept. 

It was unbelievable to me that a company ( XXXX ) who uses banks to track these transactions are not willing to track down and persecute known fraud or even offer any assistance to me. This should be defined more clearly through the XXXX app and warnings should be issued when sending money to a new contact - instead the money was transferred instantly and is now gone forever."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from wells fargo fraud dept. notifying me there were possible fraud activities on my account and to call them. When I called they notified me that there were {$2500.00} in cash advances taken out on my credit card in CA. I live in Ohio. There were also charges of {$50.00} each of two item transfers. There must have been some other fees because the total balance was {$2600.00}. I told them to immediately close those accounts.

Shortly after that I received two checks from Wells Fargo. One was for {$1200.00} the other one was {$71.00}. Attached to the check was a note stating that I had not fulfilled my obligation to Wells Fargo. 

Due to the fact that when I called the fraud department several times and they refused to give me any information on the account, I am assuming that the money they sent me was from the accounts that were opened that not been used by whoever opened at the accounts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that because I closed that account they can not reverse the online transfer. Therefore, there will be no adjustment made to my bill and the claim is now closed. 

I have now closed all of my accounts with wells fargo including the new credit card they sent me because of the fraudulent charges on the old card. According to this letter they are holding me responsible for {$2600.00} for all of the fraudulent charges that were made on my credit card account. 

Wells Fargo notified me that there were fraudulent charges on my account while before I even received a bill for them. I had not used this credit card for at least over a year. After them notifying me there was fraudulent activity I received the monthly statement proving that they were correct in telling me that there was fraudulent activity. Obviously, the bank realizes that I did not make these charges but yet are putting them on my bill and making me pay for them. 

When I closed those accounts I was not notified that this would affect the fraud claim. The reason I closed those accounts was because I was afraid there would be more fraudulent activity."

After that I called them multiple times over the years to ask how much I owed and for them to send me statements by mail. However, I was told that they didn't ; have to send me any statements. 
Recently, I contacted them because I wanted to pay-off my bill. Consequently I received a letter from them, just stating that I owed them {$14000.00}. When I called them and asked them how could that be possible, They told me that it was due to accumulation of interest. 
I then requested a breakdown and the account Representative didn't know how much did I owed when they bought the debt. They told me that they did not have that information. They bluntly told me that I owed them {$14000.00}, They took my payment of {$40.00} a month for ten years totaling {$4800.00}. Where did that money went. I am willing to pay the correct amount and that is the correct amount.

My payment was posted and applied to XX/XX/XXXX, so I reasonably assumed that my loss mitigation documentation was received and processing, since my check was received and deposited. I have sent Loancare a copy of the tracking information for the mail that was sent, along with a copy of the application. Then on XX/XX/XXXX I initiated an electronic payment from my XXXX XXXX Checking account for XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that the payment was received and I was told by a representative that the payment was there, but that it was being rejected because it was not enough. I told her I would wait for it to reach my bank. I inquired about my loss mitigation paperwork and she said she did not see it. When I called on XX/XX/XXXX to check the status of my payment, I spoke with a young woman who told me she did not see an electronic payment and that my paperwork was most likely shredded and that I should resubmit. I asked her if it was the company policy to shred misdirected mail, she said she didnt know and I should just resubmit the paperwork. I called back several times to look for my electronic payment and on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with a very rude gentleman who also said he did not see the payment. He told me to email my bank statement to XXXX, which I later discovered was an invalid email address. On the same call, we contacted XXXX XXXX on a conference call and spoke with XXXX who advised that the payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and should have been received by Loancare by the time of the call. The gentleman said okay thank you and did not ask for a tracking number or anything. I interjected and asked XXXX for the tracking number and confirmation number so that I could have proof that the payment was sent to Loancare. She provided me with a confirmation # of XXXX and trace # XXXX. At that time, the gentleman told me I would be receiving my refund and nothing further was needed. Towards the end of the call, he read a note in his system that was posted at XXXX stating the payment would be rejected. The telephone call that I made to Loancare was at approximately XXXX XXXX and lasted over an hour. I asked him why he kept me on the pone for so long if there was already a note about my payment entered into the system. He ignored my question. I asked for a supervisor call back and never received it. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with several representatives that could not help, but only offer a supervisor call back which I never received. 
I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX. She works in loss mitigation and told me she did not see the payment and advised me that my loan had just gone to foreclosure. She went further to advise me that if I had called yesterday ( which was a Sunday ) they could have offered me an in-house payment plan. I explained to her that no one ever mentioned an in-house plan as a step before foreclosure, and that I should be able to take advantage of it since all of the representatives that I spoke with were clearly negligent by not educating me about my options. In the midst of that, I had already resubmitted my 2nd loss mitigation application and was waiting for further instructions. Ms XXXX advised that she would document the call, but that should could not help me with a payment arrangement. She transferred me to Collections where I demanded to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with a young lady who said my payment was sent back to me and gave me the confirmation and tracking number that was given to me by XXXX XXXX. I explained to her that the numbers she gave me were not for the return of the money, and that whoever input the note did it incorrectly as several reps had tried giving me that same number and telling me it was for my payment being sent back to me. After waiting on hold for quite a while, I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX on the west coast, agent ID XXXX. He listened to my concerns with perceived compassion and assured me that he would research the payment. He also gave me the confirmation that was listed in the notes, but it was the same confirmation number that was given to me by XXXX XXXX. He said he would research and follow up. 
I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a rep that was able to instant message XXXX on the west coast. She relayed a message from him saying that the cashiers department needed proof of payment in writing. At that point I had become furious because 6 days were wasted. I could have requested that while I had the XXXX XXXX representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX. I became IRATE and was placed in the manager queue. A manager answered the phone and as I began to yell out of frustration, he disconnected the call. I called back and was finally able to speak to a manager in Loss Mitigation named XXXX. At that point I was severely stressed and hypertensive and needed to ask my XXXX year old daughter to get out of the car and go into XXXX so she would not have to see me having a nervous breakdown. XXXX was able to calm me down and told me that I can be placed on a payment arrangement where I would pay half of the past due ( 5 months ) and the remaining amount would be split up over 5 or 6 payments. She said I would need to do this through the Collections Department. I thanked XXXX for caring and helping me and told her I would call Collections the next day. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Collections and asked for the payment plan and was told, very rudely, that XXXX was wrong. I explained that I was very frustrated with the handling of my situation by SEVERAL reps and that someone should be able to help me. The young lady came back to the phone and said her manager would make an exception and accept 4 payments by XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that I should be given what I was originally offered and she rudely told me we are making an exception for you because this is the first time this has happened. Her tone was rude and condescending so I asked for her manager. Unfortunately I was on my lunch break and could not hold because we have to punch in right at XXXX or face penalty points. I called back later that evening and demanded to speak with a Team Lead or manager in Loss Mitigation. I was able to reach XXXX who listened to me very attentively and agreed that XXXX was wrong, but said he would do what he could to help me. I told him I DO NOT WANT A MODIFICATION and I just needed time to get a lump sum together to get out of foreclosure. He gave me the email to request the reinstatement amount and suggested that I follow up with my bank for proof of payment of the {$1000.00} that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX. Because XXXX was able to listen to my concerns, I asked if he would ask someone to research ALL of my calls and review the timeline of events in an effort to offer some kind of consideration or discretion since I feel that Loancare was very negligent in presenting me pertinent information that could help to save my house. XXXX said he would review everything. 
Because this situation has caused me a great amount of stress, I waited 9 days to call back. I called back today and spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation. She said she would have XXXX call me back with the status of his research. I have not heard anything as of XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, the writing of this letter. 
My loan is 5 months past due and I currently have 2 and a half payments that I can send in, but I need to be assured that they will process towards payments. 
Loancare has also told me that they dont take payments when a loan is this far behind, but if you review my account, you will see that they have. 
Loancare has not even investigated my original Loss Mitigation packet that was mailed in on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed a copy of the receipt with tracking number that was sent to zip code XXXX and reported as received. I understand that the Loss Mitigation Packet was sent with the payment, but I find it very hard to believe that it is the companys policy to shred anything that is not a payment. 
I sent a complaint to Loancare several times between XXXX and now asking that they review EACH AND EVERY PHONE CALL so that corrective action can be taken immediately to help me save my home. Furthermore, I NEVER RECEIVED A BREACH LETTER FROM LOANCARE. 
I spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation on XX/XX/XXXX. He assured me that I was in good shape and that my account was being reviewed by the underwriter. After over a week without any communication from LoanCare, I called on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and was told by a representative that my Loss Mitigation Request was set up for trial payments in the amount of {$1000.00} for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that I would receive documentation by XXXX or XXXX in the next few days. On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX, I called LoanCare and was told that I was denied. This is yet another instance of LoanCare giving me incorrect information, furthering my distress with this matter. 
I called XXXX for clarification, he said he would reach out to the underwriter and get back to. As of the date of this letters update ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I have not heard from XXXX. My account has now gone 6 months past due, and this could have been prevented at the 4 month mark. 
On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Loancare that had been forward y an attorneys office indicating the payoff amount for my loan. However, I requested a REINSTATEMENT amount back on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, the payoff letter expired XX/XX/XXXX, but I did not receive it until XX/XX/XXXX. Also, when I got home that night, I received a letter from LoanCare address to me and XXXX XXXX regarding a pre-foreclosure sale. I called LoanCare and spoke with XXXX and asked if there was any information in my file that LoanCare had received my complaint. XXXX indicated that I could call XXXX and file a complaint. I called that number and left a voicemail. 
On Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX AFTER XXXX Eastern Time and the recording stated they were closed. The previous recording stated there hours were Monday through Friday XXXX to XXXX Eastern Time. I called Loancare and spoke with XXXX in Loss Mitigation who advised that I would get a supervisor call back the same day. I never received the call. 
LoanCare is NOT interested in me keeping my home, but only in taking it from me so they can profit. They have stalled, lied, miscommunicated and misrepresented information on NUMEROUS occasions throughout this ordeal which has caused me a significant amount of stress. I have called numerous times over the past 7 weeks and been given inaccurate information on numerous occasions. I have NEVER received a follow-up call from a supervisor and at this point need this situation ESCALATED to HIGH MANAGEMENT. 
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS : LOANCARES REPRESENTATIVES FAILED TO INFORM ME DURING SEVERAL PHONE CALLS IN THE IN THE MONTH OF XX/XX/XXXX THAT I COULD DO AN IN-HOUSE REPAYMENT PLAN AND I WAS TOLD ON XX/XX/XXXX THAT I WAS ONE DAY LATE AND MY HOME WAS SENT TO FORECLOSURE. IT IS BECAUSE OF LOANCARES NEGLIGENCE THAT MY HOME IS IN FORECLOSURE. I AM REQUESTING ALL TELEPHONE CALLS BE PULLED AND INVESTIGATED TO PROVE THAT LOANCARE IS AT FAULT FOR MY LAON REACHING THIS LEVEL. I HAVE 5 PAYMENTS THAT I CAN SEND IN BUT THEY ARE REFUSING AND DECIDED TO PLACE MY HOME IN FORECLOSURE SO THAT THEY CAN PROFIT FROM IT. 
PLEASE REVIEW THIS INFORMATION THOUROUGHLY SO THOSE RESPONSIBLE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND I CAN RESUME PAYMENTS ON MY MORTGAGE."
Mortgage,"I started a inquiry online regarding a Rr-fi on our existing mortgage with Quicken Loans. I was then contacted via phone to proceed with the process. I informed them that my main goal was to obtain cash with the re-fi for debt consolidation etc. after going through the processes of sending them my financial information, income debt etc. I was called back and told via the phone that they could provide us the requested amount XXXX, lower our interest and lower our payment as well. I gave a verbal approval to continue. I was told that I needed to pay for the APPRAISAL which would be XXXX ( and we did ) The appraisal process was quick and came in at the amount that the preliminary numbers would need to be able to have enough difference to give us the cash etc. We signed the online forms to get the process to progress. When I reviewed the forms online, I saw that the cash was only going to be XXXX and not XXXX I sent a email the Representative that was handling my account and he quickly called me back. My email was asking if we are only getting XXXX. During the phone call, he mentioned that no everything is looking ok and we will be getting the money. After waiting over a week and a half, I checked online and now the money I would receive was only XXXX?? I called, the customer service to verify what I would receive and I was told that Yes the XXXX is all you would be getting. I emailed and called 2 different numbers with my contact and NEVER received a reply. I submitted a complaint online. The next day, we received a call from someone else that stated "" maybe we can look for another title company to save you some money to get the amount closer to your request. Several days later, we received a phone call from another person that stated our loan has a MAX of XXXX  cash available and NEVER would be possible to get XXXX with that type of loan!! I was extremely disappointed and upset. I requested him to pull the tapes on the phone calls to see that I was being told LIES. He stated they would pull the tapes and review the issue but was continuing to tell me that there is no way we could get XXXX. It has now been 4 business days ( he said it would only take a day or so ) and I have heard nothing again. I checked online again and now the cash is down to XXXX!!!!! I feel that all of the processes that this company ( Quicken Loans ). is deceptive. I am NOT a banker and I have to rely on the company to be honest with me etc. I also noticed that the XXXX was NOT for the appraisal as mentioned but for the XXXX earnest money! They NEVER told me that the XXXX was for earnest money!! This is still a on going issue and I am seeking help on this PLEASE! I feel that their practices are VERY deceptive, dishonest and in my opinion could be illegal!"
Debt collection,"I received a notice on my credit report that is not mine for the amount of {$480.00}. I kindly called the company to advise this isnt mine and that I need some type of proof of this bill. The company advised me they would send me the right documents to prove this is my bill. I received a letter with all different types of dates and balances that dates back from all the way to 2015. I have contacted all 3 credit agencies ( Transunion, XXXX, XXXX ) and disputed this charge. It cant back verified with NO PROOF a week later! which is a violation of my rights .This is nothing that shows I owe these bills. Due to this not being the correct documentation to send showing proof of collection I am requesting that this medical bill account number XXXX be removed from my credit file immediately."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have notified all 3 credit reporting bureaus of my formal dispute of the same account appearing on my reports 10 different times totaling {$570000.00}. These accounts do not belong to me. I notified XXXX XXXX   3 different time through signature required service receipts separately attached. Disputes were sent on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX all requesting for required verification and supporting documentation under the rule and guidelines of both the FDCPA and the FCRA. All 3 times XXXX XXXX violated Federal law. Further none of the information meets the required standard of Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) : Information to be disclosed. Advisory opinion to XXXX XXXX   stating, "" In sum, it is our view that a CRA that always scrambles or truncates account ( or social security ) numbers does not technically comply with Section 609 because it does not provide "" accurate '' ( and perhaps not "" clear '' ) disclosure of "" all information '' in the file ''."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been a victim of identity theft, accounts had been opened in my name so, I'm requesting these information to be block from my credit report in accordance with the FCRA.This has cause a great damage to mi ability to get a better job as well as get fundig .Please remove these items, any none account holding inquiries and any address other than my current address to prevent any further damage to my credit report.After you have remove items please send me copy of updated report. 
An FTC had been filed and a police report will be filed. 
Thank you."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Today XX/XX/XXXX went online to dispute the incorrect personal information and it says This request can not be processed online
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX academic year. I got excellent grades and I transferred to a school with a better reputation for better job prospects. Around lateXX/XX/XXXX I began receiving bills from XXXX XXXX XXXX in the amount of XXXX dollars. I called the school to determine what the charge was from. I was told that my account was not settled and that they would refer my account to collections. When I asked what the charge was from they said it was my tuition. I told the school I already paid the tuition in full, and that was how I was able to transfer my transcript to my new school. 
It is common policy in American academic institutions to not release a students transcripts without paying their bill. I thought nothing of it, but the school referred the matter to a collection agency without telling me what the charge was for. When I kept getting collection calls, I called the school and a representative at the XXXX office told me that the charge was due to an "" unnoficial withdrawal. '' I told them that I paid all the tuition and fees for the year that I attended and that this charge was unfair but they demanded that I pay it. I was a XXXX XXXX XXXX and had no money so I did not. In XX/XX/XXXX I passed the XXXX XXXX XXXX in New York State, I needed my transcripts from schools for job applications. When I called XXXX they said that there was a hold on my account and that this charge for "" unnoficial withdrawal '' was sent to a collections agency. After a lengthy pleading process for leniency the Registrar, XXXX XXXX, agreed to remove the hold and forgive that charge. The annual tuition at XXXX was around XXXX dollars and we both agreed that charge for Unofficial Withdrawal, which I had no idea about at the time of transfer seemed unnecessary, petty and unfair. I did not withdraw from school, I transferred. Now the credit reporting company has reduced my credit score, and apparently noone was notified that my hold was released."
Mortgage,"I contacted my mortgage company approximately XXXX of XXXX to state that I had noticed I was being charged for private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) when I received my 1098, even though my principal owed was below the required threshold. They indicated that they would be removing it from my loan at that time. This year, I have received my 1098 from them and observed that I am still paying PMI and my payments would be increasing according to my statement. This is only noticeable when these statements are sent out at the end of the year because throughout the year, these items are not discernible, due to the fact they are all inclusive and listed solely as "" Tax & Insurance '' in the monthly statement. I have since contacted them again on XX/XX/XXXX to dispute my need for PMI and was told I would be receiving something in the mail in the next 10 business days but they didn't know why I was being charged."
Student loan,"I have been trying to work with Navient the past two years in trying to get my payments lowered on my account, I have over {$150000.00} in debt and they are no help. When I first called about the situation all they did was just tell me to get a forbearance because they said thats all I could do .. I called a couple of months later and they in XX/XX/2018 and the told me I could get lower payments after I made 3 payments of {$530.00}. So I set those payments up and in the process of it they brought my account current with a disaster forbearance which they have done multiple times and with request to remove them They said they couldnt do that ... I then called almost everyday to see if I needed to keep the payments on file or would I be on the program or I dont, I was told multiple times that I would be fine and in the program and every representative I spoke with told me it was fine because I had other bills and expenses to pay. When I came off of the forbearance I was not in the program and they told me that it was my fault and I didnt do the payments they told me to. I told them to review the accounts and the calls and they told me they didnt which I know they didnt because they claim I havent talked to anyone which I know I did and my fianc has been with me every call I even spoke with a manager. I do not feel as though my situation would be as bad if they would have helped me from the beginning. They have called me 6 times a day before harassing me everyday and I could be on the phone with someone and here they go calling. I have been giving forbearances when I advised them I cant afford the payment and they tell me thats all they can do .."
Debt collection,"I received a notice from Transworld Systems Inc on XXXX stating that I owed a collection debt from the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I knew nothing about this outstanding violation so I verbally disputed it on XXXXI asked TSI for proof of the debt, I have had an active XXXX XXXX account for many years so I should not have received any toll violations. I did not get a response. As a side bar, I moved on XX/XX/XXXX and all of my mail was not forwarded until XX/XX/XXXX. ( I have proof ... the actual XXXX envelopes with the forwarded date ) In this forwarded mail I received the toll violation notices from the XXXX. I then tried to dispute these fees with the XXXX in XXXX but at this point they were in collection so I was told to contact TSI again. I reached out to TSI on XXXX and spoke to XXXX XXXX. She said that there was no new information regarding my dispute from 4 months ago. This is unacceptable. I paid the actual toll amount to her on the phone of {$8.00}. This collection company can not validate this debt. They are threatening to infere in the renewal of my car 's registration. I asked to speak with her supervisor and was forwarded to a voice mail for XXXX. I should not be required to pay a {$100.00} fee to this collection agency for 3 reasons - I disputed this fee immediately upon receipt of their notice and it's 4 months later and the have not responsed -I had and have an active XXXX XXXX account -I did not receive the XXXX notices in a timely matter due to my move and my mail not being forwarded by the USPS Please assist me in this matter."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I'm filing a complaint against Equifax and XXXX  regarding my credit report. Both companies have failed to provide any proof that I gave these lenders promission to pull my credit. I never gave these companies any consent to inquiry my credit report. There was a hard pull from XXXX XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/2017 and another hard pull from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2017. I need a signed application stating that I authorized these inquiries. If the credit companies can't provide these signed documents, please have these two hard pulls removed from my credit report. 
XXXX  file # XXXX and Equifax file # XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX I placed an online order with the company XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX using my American Express Credit Card. This order was "" supposedly '' delivered to me by merchant. When contacted XXXX to dispute transaction they never respond. Only once was I contacted about this on an email that stated the situation was being escalated, never heard from them again. My credit card company received the dispute on the charge directly by me, and after a month they now decided to side with this merchant and their excuse stating the goods were delivered to me even though, me nor anyone in my household ever sign and acknowledged the arrival or delivery of purchase. There is a man office located at the main entrance of my apartment complex, my apartment complex is also a gated community. If the delivery driver saw the opportunity to skip the main office were this packages should be delivered to, and thought was easier to just enter with no code or authorization to my property was the wrong call. Left a package stranded on some random door, cant even confirm it was my apartment and now don't want to refund my money or at least offer to send merchandise I paid for. I already provided the main office contact info to both the credit company and the merchant to confirm procedure for package deliveries and to prove neither I or management received this goods still no resolution. I don't have my money, no one seems to care about it, at the end of the day is just {$200.00} for them ... pocket change for these corporations run by billionaires whom don't care about us the nave population."
Student loan,"I have had a loan with a principal balance of {$64000.00} since 2013. It is now over {$70000.00} due to accrued interest. Interest has been a nightmare for me and I am sure plenty of other students. I was tipped early on to pay attention to interest and pay it down while in school, and I did so. I even paid some of the smaller school loans off in full before my loan went into effect in 2013. From the get-go, I have always been on an income based plan. At that time, there was no way I could afford rent, utilities, daycare, etc. along with a $ 700+ school loan payment each month. When I was first applying for the income based plan, I spoke to a representative about it in general. He explained to me that the payments are lowered but only low enough to cover interest. As such, I was always under the impression that the payments were only as low as the interest that accrues each month. Otherwise, what's the point? I do not like to let interest accrue. I do not want to risk having any accrued interest capitalized. I would not have agreed to this if I knew better. I feel I was misguided. Anyway, I started the plan. I set myself up for automatic payments. I went on with life until I felt I could start paying down my loan. After some time, I noticed the balance on my loan jumped from XXXX to over 70k. How did my balance increase after I have been making payments on it regularly? I called to question it and learned that it is due to {$6000.00} of accrued interest! My payments are less than the amount of interest accrued each month, so it has been racking up without my knowing. Who knows if it has even been capitalized. I keep trying to find documentation to figure out so, but I can't find anything to help me much. The rep says it isn't capitalized. So here I am ... ready to try to tackle some of my principal, and I can't, because I have a ton of accrued interest to work on before I can even touch principal. I feel helpless. What's the point of having an income based or other plan when you are struggling financially? All you are doing is paying and/or accruing interest ... never touching your principal. I thought the income based plan lowered payments yet still applied to a portion of principal and interest in a pro-rated fashion to what the regular payment amount would be. This is not helping us!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have direct deposit on my NetSpend card and I lost my NetSpend card and canceled it and I have been trying to transfer the amount allowed to another NetSpend account and have been trying for three days now with no success because they keep giving me a hard time and i have called a total of 14 times in one day alone and getting some recording 4 times in a row saying they could not hear me and it was my phone that was having difficulty and each time was the same voice and same exact message pretending to speak to me when it was just a recording. also they went from giving me different information each and every time i called about how much money i was allowed to transfer and each time i was getting told the amount went lower and lower at the very end i was only able to transfer XXXX dollars, which makes me feel like i am being deprived of my own earning and they have complete control over my money. in the end i asked to speak to a manager or supervisor with the last 3 reps i spoke to and each time they were hesitant and made me wait more then 45 min each time to then lose the call when being put on hold, so i decided to wait another 45 min one last time and finally i was able to speak to management which also gave me a hard time. so they went from me being able to transfer XXXX in the morning to XXXX dollars by XXXX XXXX  a total of 1 hour and 45 min i think is not fair or comforting plus they would not give me contact information on anyone above them to contact and kept telling me that they would send an email to them and i would be contacted in two days. lastly it has been more them 2 months that i expedited my order for a new card which i was charged and was to get in the mail within 2 days and never have recieved it and i have called many times about the matter each time being told that they will send a new one and cancle the last one ordered so that why i have to keep transfering money to a new card each time and being charger XXXX dollars for each transfer which is robbery when they are failing to meet my needs as a customer. this is my hard earned money and they are holding and keeping it away from me."
Student loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with Sallie Mae about my loans, indicating that I want to qualify for the PSLF program, and was told that I had the correct type of loan for forgiveness but none of the forms were created yet for the program as you need 10 years to qualify. I was told that being in forbearance wouldn't hurt, as it is a type of repayment plan multiple times then and until XX/XX/XXXX. 

My loan was transferred to Navient when Sallie Mae was defunct. I called them when I was transferred, and they assured me that utilizing income sensitive repayment options and/or the lowest payment amount, which at times was XXXX $ a month in forbearance, was fine for the PSLF program. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, after re-applying for income sensitive repayment again, I called again, and indicated that I could afford some payment and did not need a full forbearance, and they told me that I qualified for forbearance, and so that is the best thing for me to do. I asked what would happen if I sent payments anyways, and they said, basically nothing, because the balance and interest was so high that sending XXXX-XXXX $ a month wouldn't do any good, and wouldn't change my plan. At that time I was first told that I was not in a program that would qualify me for the PSLF program, and that in order to qualify for that program, I would have to re-consolidate my loans and have my husband co-sign them. She indicated that she was only telling me this because now she was "" legally obligated to do so. '' She indicated that once I reconsolidated I could get into the right program but it would be 10 more years before I qualify, and as it has been 2 decades since my first set of loans, she didn't recommend it as I would be at the 30 year mark anyways. 

I have worked for public agencies with lower pay than public agencies, in public service, since XX/XX/XXXX. I have no idea how many "" qualifying payments '' were made, as often the forbearance was the only option given to me. I suspect that I made roughly 6 years of payments in plans that don't qualify me for the program, and my debt is now over 200,000 $ and my interest rate remains over 6 %. I have been unable to get any clear information about what plans do qualify for the program, and any information from Navient. I don't understand why my husband would have to co-sign my student loans in order for me to qualify for a program that I should already qualify for due to my years of public service. There is no where to turn for answers as Navient is not doing their job."
Debt collection,"To whom it may concern, In approximately XXXX, my wages were being garnished for a student loan debt by debt collectors of Eaton Group Attorneys. XXXX of XXXX I contacted Eaton Group and spoke to XXXX ( XXXX ) to inquire about this debt. I was notified that they had a 2nd garnishment for a XXXX credit card that they were then collecting on. I was not notified of this at all. So XX/XX/XXXX I received payments from Eaton Group in  approximately over {$800.00} for overpayment. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was sent a judgment letter against me rewarding XXXX XXXX   {$4500.00} for this XXXX credit card account. I once again never received court documents until they were supposedly filed against me. I notified Eaton Group Attorneys that I was seeking legal advice and needed more information on this debt. I always inquired about the statutes on this credit card since it was from XXXX, and the account was closed. In XX/XX/XXXX I received more documents where their was a court date and I was not notified. The supposed judge issued a wage garnishment for this account from XXXX. I sent a written correspondence to Eaton Group requesting more information and why wasn't I notified of a court date. I also advised them to submit all info regarding this to my attorney. I heard nothing, but my wages began being garnished on this 20 year old account. 

After contacting XXXX regarding this issue, they had no knowledge of the account being open and were no longer collecting. After carefully looking over my credit report, this account from XXXX is open without my knowledge with an credit limit of {$3500.00} in which I did not authorize this account. XXXX credit bureau could not give me any information or had no knowledge of this account. So I have a 20 year old account where my wages are being garnished and a open credit card account I did not authorize. Eaton Group Attorneys has failed to submit information from XXXX."
Checking or savings account,Ally bank. I opened a account and deposited a check. They locked my account with asking me. The reps on the phone don't help and they said that's it fine. I lt happened last Wednesday. I called multiple times and nothing happened. I need the money and it's disgusting that they lock my account and nothing happened.
Checking or savings account,"The Bank of America has decided to close my account without giving me an appropriate response. I spoke to the Bank 's account closing department and they pointed to a customer agreement and they said they took a business decision to close the account and they are not required to provide any reason to me. 

I am operating this account as a joint holder along with my husband since XX/XX/1999. I have been the bank 's customer for over 20 years. I work with a reputed organization and earn annually $ XXXX. I also have a brokerage account with the bank 's brokerage arm ( XXXX XXXX ) with net funds invested over $ 300K. 

There was not a single incident of violation reported on my account from my side in last 20 years. I am a law-abiding permanent resident of the USA. Such an abrupt closing of my account without citing any reason makes me feel the bank has discriminated against me. 

Please look in to this as soon as possible. 

Thanks, XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have sent multiple letters to Equifax I have called them multiple times Im now filing a complaint today I spoke with an agent at Equifax who yelled put me on hold for over an hour came back on the line and said goodbye and hung up. I found my identity theft report and it is terrible to be victimized by identity thieves and then again by Equifax. I sent Equifax my proof of identity including state ID Social Security card bank statements and utility bills they are also aware of identity theft report they continue to write me saying they can not find a file on these which is not true as I have a copy of my Equifax report. None of the documents I sent Equifax contain my middle name nor did any documents have my middle initial but when Equifax sends me bogus letters saying they cant find my file they always include my full name including my middle name if they cant find my file how do they have my middle name I feel like this company Equifax is not honest and they do not care about the consumers I have the right to an accurate credit report free of errors due to no actions of my own. It has been over 45 days and Equifax refuses to acknowledge their error. There is an item on my credit report that shows a charge off account the creditor is listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have never had an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX I have never authorized an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX I have never been in the military there is another era that is listed as XXXX XXXX and shows an original predator as XXXX XXXX XXXX the same applies here I have never had any financial dealings authorizations or use of XXXX XXXX the XXXX XXXX account shows That it was opened in XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX shows opened XX/XX/XXXX Equifax is getting paid by these financial institution and it seems as though they work for them and do not care who they harm were their erroneous entries. I have not authorized in anyway any of these accounts and I feel like Im just a number to Equifax and they are damaging me causing me to be denied lower interest rates or financing because of my in accurate Equifax report please help in this situation contact Equifax. 
Respectfully"
Mortgage,"Fifth Third sent me a letter saying that my property insurance expired and instructing me to submit proof of insurance. They dated the letter XX/XX/XXXX, which is the actual date that my insurance policy expired and was renewed. My insurance company renews the insurance every year, and their notification specifically states that they will notify the mortgagee if they do not renew the policy. I believe that the insurance company additionally sends notification of renewal to Fifth Third every year, probably on XX/XX/XXXX when they renew it. 

My complaint is that it's inefficient and bothersome for Fifth Third to send me the same letter every year on XX/XX/XXXX, without even giving the insurance company a few days to send in the mortgagee the renewal notification. Additionally, Fifth Third knows that I've renewed the policy every year and that my insurance company can easily provide proof of renewal directly. Third, the insurance company has promised to send Fifth Third notification if I fail to keep insurance in force. Fourth, most mortgage companies have sophisticated communication systems with major insurance companies ( like mine ) and can more efficiently verify insurance by contacting the insurance company. This is often done with direct communication links and doesn't require anything out of the ordinary. Fifth, before Fifth Third became the servicer for this same mortgage, there was a different servicer who did not engage in this wasted effort. 

It is simply a waste of time and effort for everyone for Fifth Third to send the letter to me on the renewal date instead of waiting ten days or so. It wastes my time locating proof of insurance from my insurance company and sending it to Fifth Third. It wastes my insurance company 's time and energy providing the proof of insurance to me even though it was already provided. It wastes Fifth Third 's time in reviewing my proof of insurance this way even though it would be more efficient to do in another way.

Fifth Third 's servicing procedure could easily be changed to wait ten days and then see whether or not my insurance company sent notice. Alternatively Fifth Third could easily contact my insurance company or safely rely on the insurance company 's agreement to notify them if the insurance policy does not renew.

Instead, Fifth Third sends me a threatening letter indicating that they will buy insurance on the property unless I provide proof of insurance immediately. This is just not a reasonable use of everyone 's resources. Also, the threatening letter is unnecessarily harsh and demanding, particularly since they don't even wait ONE day after renewal to allow time to receive proof of insurance."
Credit card or prepaid card,I have attempted several times to reach out to Citi for assistance as I am unemployed due to Covid and I as of XX/XX/2021 had my unemployment end. I have no source of income. I asked Citi if I can have my due date which is today moved to the end of the month and they refused. I asked for smaller payments and they also refused. I have been making on time payments since I opened the was opened. I dont want this to affect my credit but unfortunately due to Citi refusing to work with me during these harsh times because of Covid but they arent willing to help.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I don't know what actual route I need to take through the prompts are to get to the right place, so this is probably not in the right department.

I found out today that Experian has been charging me {$22.00} a month for something that I did not want and had no idea that there was any recurring charge, let alone the insanity that is {$22.00} a month.

I paid {$1.00} for what I thought was a 7-day trial so that I could see my credit score a single time. Apparently the 7-day trial is a 7-day period of a "" discount '' before the price goes up to $ XXXX/month, not a 7-day trial to check your score before you lose access to it as I think almost anyone would expect.

They pay to have XXXX  display them at the top when someone searches for "" free credit score '', then they actually charge you {$1.00}, which is actually over {$250.00} a year. This is not ok. We are held unjustly behind an unfair and unregulated credit score system, extorted to even be able to check it, then are hit with hidden bills like this. Seriously?

I was under the impression that stuff like this was supposed to be shut down. Isn't this the EXACT situation referenced in this article?

XXXX XXXX XXXX Thank you for any help on this matter and for doing the work that you do. It IS VITAL.

Additional information that I find egregious : 1. I have no email from them telling me that I'm being billed or even that I created an account.

2. They make it nearly impossible to figure out how to cancel future charges. I honestly don't know if I am opted out of the recurring charges or not at this point.

3. They hold customer service hours that make bank hours look like XXXX. I can't contact them in any reasonable way during any reasonable hours. I work. They know that. That's why they have such unreasonable hours. This is not right."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",The credit bureaus are reporting inaccurate/outdated/incomplete personal information.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax refuses to address a problem with accessing our credit report that only they can fix. We worked with five different difficult-to-understand agents, supervisors, and managers over a period of three long hours and none of them were willing to do anything but execute the same old script which required us to answer a number of computer-generated questions that our answers did not satisfy. A number of those questions were based on the content of our credit report. I believe the failed answers were actually due to incorrect content in the report, not our personal information. That is evidenced by a number of online attempts which presented a number of content questions that were obviously not from our account because none of them matched any of our mortgage or credit items. Not only did they carelessly allow hackers to steal our data a couple of years ago, they are now corrupting our report so badly that we can't even access it. They claim they are trying to protect our identity, and are requesting we submit additional information to prove our identity before they can allow us to access our account. But, why should we because they have already proven themselves to be untrustworthy and unresponsive? Besides, all a banker needs is our name and SS numbers to access our report, and we have already given them far more than that -- and it's our information! How long are we to put up with Equifax 's careless and incompetent handling of important and sensitive information? By the way, our credit reports with XXXX and XXXX are fine."
Consumer Loan,"i built a modular home on XXXX, fl. in XXXX county. triad financial handled to loan. florida law changed XX/XX/XXXX to allow titling of modular homes if XXXX criteria are met. it must be modular AND on a mobile home lot. zoning for the lot i built on does NOT allow mobile homes. i informed triad that it can not be titled. they did so anyway and charged me for the fee. i visited the dmv office in XXXX county. they told me it should not have been titled but was at XXXX. they assured me they could get it fixed and issue real property designation. they called later to tell me they can not do so while triad has a lein on the property. triad could transfer the lein to the land but will not do so. the home has been declared permanent by XXXX county and the state of florida. i can not refinance without real property designations i should n't even need to aquire. the home is permanently affixed to the land. i have n't been able to find anyone else that will finance."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Capital One continues to send me prepaid offers for a previous tenant, one who has  been gone for several years. This is creating a threat vector for this individual who could have his identity compromised by an individual (the new tenant, currently myself) who could use this constant barrage of pre-approved offers to the old address.I've sent pictures of the letters multiple times to privacy@ and abuse@ Capital One and there has been no response or change in their behavior.  In my opinion, they should not be sending pre-approved offers to individuals who do not live at the residence on file, especially if the postal service or the current tenant advises them that they are leaking possible PII and providing an opportunity for third parties to accept pre-approved offers unauthorized on their behalf.Please have them stop sending me offers for the previous tenant."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have a collection showing up on my credit report for an apartment I never lived at.

I noticed the collection in XX/XX/2019. Not sure if its because of XXXX data breach or not
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX has reported an account delinquency on a paid off account. I owe no balance on the account since XX/XX/18. They originally ove rcredited the account giving me a surplus balance which was intended for another credit card, same company. Both numbers were listed on the check and both payment slips were included to correctly identify the amounts. 
On XX/XX/18 I realized they had made a mistake and called to have it corrected. The XXXX XXXX employee backed out the payment and once again credited the incorrect account. On XX/XX/18 I owed nothing in XXXX they reported a 30 day overdue payment for the original amount {$57.00} plus XXXX in interest. I have had this happen with XXXX XXXX over a 13 year relationship a number of times and so am currently calling in my payments separately for each account but they charge additional fees for that. 
On XX/XX/18, I called and they rectified and backdated the payment to reflect ALL 3 errors on the part of XXXX XXXX,  and are sending me a letter with the specifics in the meantime I have a delinquency on my credit report and my score dropped about 20 points which could change my interest rates in other credit cards."
Credit card or prepaid card,Wells Fargo contacted me about fraudulent charges on my card. They then cancelled my card and told me they would send a new one. They have not sent a new one and I can not access my account online. I waited for my card as instructed for approximately a month before they called and said I was late on my payment. I paid and complained that they had not sent a card and had not given me online access. They also filed a credit report and hurt my credit and charged a late fee. I paid the owed payments including the late fee even though I felt it was unfair. I have been unable to pay because they changed my account number and have not sent me any information on my amended account. It has been a month or so since and they have still not sent a card and have not given me any online access. They have stopped being helpful on the phone and they are now hurting my credit more.
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Due to a lapse in employment, I was unable to pay this loan. After a phone call with the company on XX/XX/XXXX, I was under the impression that i would be able to make payments when I can over the phone. 

When I would try to talk to the company on the phone, i would be on hold for close to 1 hour. I have been hung up on multiple times with the company. I have sent multiple messages, to the company trying to make a payment arrangement and nothing would ever be set up. 

After filing a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX I was able to speak to a XXXX XXXX who was able to complete a liquidation request for my account, to use the money lion connected liquidation account to pay off my loan balance. At that time, I was not told of a liquidation lien for the payoff. That payoff was processed XX/XX/XXXX. 

After trying in vain to reach Money Lion, with the XXXX account website coming back as a 404 error. and the atlassian.moneylion.com email also coming back as a 404 error, and being taken through numerous hoops to finish paying this account, I now have a 90 day late notice on my credit report with XXXX XXXX for a payment that was made XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was then told by a customer service person that a liquidation lien was placed on my account, which stays on the account for 60 days. That would lead this loan to being 120 days late, for a payoff that was already processed XX/XX/XXXX. They did not tell me about this lien, and I personally do not believe that they are telling the truth with respect to this liquidation lien. I believe that XXXX is a criminal company, and should be shut down."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2019 I submitted a complete financial application for assistance with my mortgage. I had fallen behind after my mortgage payment ballooned from {$1000.00} per month to over {$3000.00} per month. My application contained all of the required documentation that was up to date including my bank statements from closing dates XX/XX/2019, XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019. Those three bank statements showed my rental income deposits. Since that submission PHH is stating the bank statements I submitted are too old ( over 90 days ). They are saying this after stalling on making a decision on my application since that submission date. Most recently they sent out a letter stating the bank statements are over 90 days old. I hired an attorney to assist me and the attorney keeps telling PHH they are required by RESPA Regulation 1024.41 to review application and make a decision. They are not allowed to continue to let paperwork expire and ask for it over and over again. That was the purpose of RESPA Regulation X. PHH continues to do this and evade reviewing my application. Under duress I have sent in an additional bank statement as of today."

I have notified the 3 credit bureaus last year and again this year and the response is that I can not dispute the same items twice. The credit bureaus are not abiding by the law when it comes to bankruptcy."
Mortgage,"I did recieve notice that my loan had been sold nor that servicers had been changed until months after my servicer had changed. After learning of the change I was 3 months behind on my mortgage which I was told if i set up automatic payments to be withdrawn by the servicer each month the late missed payments would be deferred and i would be made current on my loan payments. I set up automatic payment withdrawl but was notified in XXXX that no payments had been withdrawn and my mortgage was now 9 months behind and my home was being set for forclosure sale and would be auctioned on XX/XX/2020. The servicer, Fay Servicing told me to send in an application for Loan Assistance Modification. The servicer spoke with me on the phone and told me they would email me the information needed for the loan assistance application. I recieved an email that stated that the loan application was attached and to return it. The application Fay Servicing had provided was completed and returned. After multiple attempts to contact my loan speacialist and after waiting 10 days I contacted Fay Servicing and spoke to a customer service representative who verified my application had been recieved and was in his words "" complete except for the insurance declaration ''. It was during this call that i was told I was supposed to include a declaration of homeowners insurance with my application. I sent this in that day but recieved a letter from Fay Servicing days later stating my application for loan assistance had been denied due to an incomplete application. I explained that i had not been told in my email from my loan servicer that the dexlaration was needed with my application and that the the lender had obtained insurance on my home. I was told there was nothing they could do now brcause the 37 day prior to foreclosure date had past so a new application would not be accepted despite them providing incomplete information. I spoke to my loan servicer specialist who sent me the email lacking the complete application requirements and she said there was nothing she could do and my only option was to pay the costume mortgage payments an additional fees prior to foreclosure date. I then received another letter stating that Fay servicing have canceled the lender obtained insurance the day after recieving my insurance declaration. Now my home is going to be auctioned and i was not offered any services to avoid foreclosure because what i was offered was not offered correctly and this has resukted in my home possibly being lost due to this new servicer. Prior to the switching of loan servicers i was up to date on my payments and had no issues with my loan. Now im going to lose my home due to the new servicers errors."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax failed to open a dispute and subsequently investigate an erroneous debt collection for which I was denied credit including a mortgage. Equifax 's website is insanely difficult to use : there's no place to request a FREE credit report within 60d of being denied credit based on reporting agencies. When I tried to order one as the free annual one, Equifax claims that it can not verify my identity. Then Equifax emails that my order is ready for review, provides an ID # and a username and a DEAD link that does not go to a site so that I can enter the provided ID # and username. I hold a XXXX  in  XXXX, a XXXX  and XXXX  in XXXX but I can't navigate Equifax 's website! 

When I tried to dispute the debt again, Equifax then asks a series of questions -- NONE OF WHICH APPLY to me so when I accurately answered as such, Equifax once again said my answers do not match its records so use XXXX to request my report. 
The problem is when you click on XXXX it takes you right back to its website where it wants you to PAY for the credit report. 

All the other reporting agencies, XXXX  and XXXX have investigated ( apparently ) and removed the debt collection from my report -- the ONLY derogatory item on my credit report. With Equifax, I can't even order my credit report or submit a dispute. Not even by phone -- the phone tree dead ends so you can't talk to anyone. It just disconnects. 

Equifax 's failure to investigate dispute and non-compliance w/ state and fed law by providing a free report if denied credit w/in the past 60d has directly resulted in my being denied credit card accounts and a mortgage!"

I contacted Coinbase XX/XX/XXXX to inform them that my funds hadn't arrived in a timely manner and they told me it would take five days to investigate. Immediately after getting off of the phone, I received and email from Coinbase support stating that it would take four to five weeks for a specialist to review.

I was then sent a letter stating that the debt was to be paid THAT DAY by ACH transfer OR Credit card. Fearing that the company may in some way be deceptive ( Based on internet information available to me ), I stated that any payments would be made by XXXX   check. They then made harassing telephone calls to me at my office ( on a recorded line ), then two calls to me harassing me on my cell phone. Then I received a text message stating "" Should I call XXXX, XXXX or XXXX to get them to pay your debt ''. Those are my wife and children, not associated in any way with my business. 

I proceeded at that point to send an email with the following language : Harassing me in my office by telephone and harassing me on my cell phone are one thing, but sending me a text message threatening to harass my wife and children is unacceptable. I refuse to be on a phone call in which I am being yelled at and berated, hence the reason for my exiting the phone call ( all recorded ), but you have stepped way over the line.

Vehicle loan or lease,"I learned on XX/XX/2019, via mail that a vehicle had been purchased in my name from XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, NC, on XX/XX/2019. The vehicle was sold on a loan made by Bank of America for the principal amount of {$84000.00}. Upon discovering this loan was made, I immediately contacted Bank of America and they confirmed the loan had been made. On the same call, I advised Bank of America that this loan was fraudulent and that I did not make it nor authorize it and determined that my identity had been stolen. I was notified by the Bank of America representative on the call that their fraud department was closed for the evening and that I would need to speak with someone the following day. The representative advised me that I would need to submit a police report for the case. I opened a case that very evening. After contacting the XXXX XXXX ( GA ) Police Department ( my  local department at the time ), I was notified that I would need to open a case where the fraud occurred, but they did issue me an incident #, XXXX. I contacted the XXXX Police Department and opened case # XXXX. I then contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX the evening of XX/XX/2019 and notified them that the vehicle they sold was not to me and that I did not authorize the use of my name nor credit, and they had sold the vehicle to someone using my stolen identity. 

XXXX XXXX of the Bank of America Fraud Division contacted me the following day and informed me that she would send me paperwork asserting my denial of financial responsibility. I completed the forms, had them notarized, and submitted them via registered mail to the Bank of America office in XXXX, CA ( XXXX, XXXX XXXX   XXXX, XXXX, CA ). I was notified by Ms. XXXX on or about the week of XX/XX/2019 that she received the paperwork and that I would have a decision within 30 days. 

After a number of follow-up attempts with Bank of America, with absolutely no response from them via email or phone, I was finally contacted today by XXXX XXXX in the same department. She notified me over the phone that the loan was deemed a non-fraud case, which is an absolute farce, because I never authorized the loan. As importantly, Bank of America did not notify me, neither through phone nor mail nor email that the case had been resolved. I had to leave numerous non-returned voice mails before someone contacted my back on XX/XX/2019. Bank of America maintains that I owe them for a loan I did not make nor had any part of. This has negatively affected my credit and prevented me from obtaining credit. Additionally, Bank of America sent me a harassing letter maintaining that I need to register a vehicle that I don't own nor have ever seen in the state of Georgia, or be in default of the loan terms."

In XX/XX/XXXX, Experian allowed XXXX to put this back onto my report again (Only with Experian); this is fraudulent behavior and I've reached out to Experian, last year and again this year, with no response.  I've also filed a complaint with the AG's office about both companies: Experian & XXXX.  I provided the necessary documentation to successfully dispute and it's unethical at this point to ask me to 'find something' yet again!"
Debt collection,"In early XX/XX/2019 I noticed an entry from The XXXX XXXX on my credit report. I sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that letter was received on XX/XX/XXXX. In the letter I stated there was an entry for {$620.00} on my credit report and just to simply get this off my report that I would pay {$310.00} which was half of the debt that was mentioned on my credit report. In the letter I also stated that cashing the check the company would be agreeing to completely remove this off of my credit report with all 3 bureaus and not report this as a paid collection or settled account. The check was cashed by a Continental Finance and when I check my report the entry was completely removed. I was alerted on XX/XX/XXXX that a company by Continental Finance has placed a charge off on my account for {$310.00} which appears to be the other half of the debt that was reported on my credit report. This seems to be a sister company to XXXX XXXX XXXX. So essentially, my money was taken and XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed to the terms of deleting this from my credit report and did indeed removed but turned back around and fraudulently had a sister company list this on my credit report. If there was an issue agreeing to the terms then the check should have never been cashed and a verification letter should have been sent to me and it was not. I have never had any dealing with Continental Finance so I'm not sure why they even have this account and further they are also operating as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, so there appears to be 3 companies operating as one for this purpose. Since the company cashed the check they have agreed to have this completed removed from my credit report so it should not be there and I have kept all documentation. This company should be investigated to see how many consumers they are doing this to. In addition, they should be looked into to ensure that they are abiding by the SCRA ( Servicemembers Relief Act ) laws for XXXX XXXX members of 6 % percentage rate, I don't believe this company is following the law in regard to that and I'm curious how many other XXXX XXXX members are affected by that as a whole."
Checking or savings account,"Account shut down due to "" XXXX '' the CSR 's could not elaborate. I'm looking for answers. Where's my XXXX dollar account opening bonus, what was the XXXX reasoning ( too many new accounts, negative comment ) and lastly what will you be placing on my XXXX XXXX for closing reason. I am following up with the CFPB. The manager XXXX in the XXXX branch was the one that terminated my account, but she couldn't elaborate. She gave me the runaround and told me to contact the XXXX number in which they told me to contact the branch manager ( XXXX ).

I made a telephone payment on XX/XX/XXXX. My payments from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX were automatically deducted. Since additional principal payments were paid on my account, another payment wasnt due until XX/XX/XXXX.

HSBC said to ask them to validate the debt. XXXX can not validate the debt other than a charge off date ( XXXX ) and last 4 of the card. After speaking with Mrs. XXXX ( after they called at XXXX ) several times on XX/XX/XXXX. she sent my file to "" fraud ''. 
They called me again on XX/XX/XXXX robo message left om my phone, XX/XX/XXXX they called me again with no message left. XXXX another man calls me and is very abusive yelling at me that i don't understand what mediation is and he is trying to help me. He keeps saying that they are mediators, he would never admit that they are a collection agency, which is against the law! I requested him to mail me something and he said "" why would I waste my time mailing you something if you don't agree to my help '' He yelled the entire time, said that "" THEY '' are going to put a judgment against you and put this back on your credit and garnish your wages, then he backtracked and said that they can't garnish in my state. I asked for his supervisor and he said "" what part of "" director '' don't you understand in my title! I am the supervisor!! He hung up on me and I called him back. Told him that my only goal is to get information to validate the debt because i knew nothing about it. He accused me of lying saying it's been on my credit report. And that I would have to file a police report to dispute it, but no one is going to believe me in the court of law. I placed my complaint on XXXX with what my complaint was. They called called me today and said that it sounded like this debt collection agency purchased a really old file and they are trying to get folks to pay for things that are not even active any longer. XX/XX/XXXX I called back ( XXXX XXXX  ) today on the first numberXXXX as the number from the man was not good ( XXXX ) I got Mrs. XXXX and informed her I was recording the call. Asked her to validate the name of her company ( 4 times ), she kept saying hold on, hold on ... .I said that's a very simple request ... ..she then said "" XXXX XXXX and I do not give you permission to record this call ''. Bottom line, I did have an HSBC card that was included in a bankruptcy over XX/XX/XXXX years ago, so this should never be coming up and I should not be getting any calls from anyone. Told them never to call me again and she responded that she would let the case manager know."
Debt collection,I have submitted multiple disputes to this company to validate my debt. Every time i submit a dispute it comes back as verified but not with the supporting documents. I have used different methods to stop the illegal reporting of this account to the bureaus.
Debt collection,"I was summoned on XX/XX/19 for a pre trial mediation on XX/XX/19. The law suit claims that XXXX XXXX is the plaintiff but the documents show that Pollack & Rossen, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Florida, XXXX are the actual plaintiffs. The summons itself is a cut and paste document poorly done. Once googled they are notorious and have had class actions against them. By law XXXX XXXX would have charged of this debt in 180 days of non payment. I suspect they purchased the debt and by using XXXX XXXX as plaintiff is fraud, a practice for which they have been sued for in the past. 

I am no stranger to this tactic as a business owner for over 35 years. Mediation is to see what assets I have, such as homes stocks etc. which I have none. I am a XXXX year old retired single man living on social security. Their threats for garnishing wages, seizing bank accounts and property are disturbing to say the least. And I am sure violate best practices.

My counselor explained that it was not in my budget to do so but he continued to threaten legal action. My counselor asked XXXX if he or anyone else could take my payment of {$100.00} and he said no. He would not take my payment."
Mortgage,"I received a notice from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX that I was behind with one of my accounts and so I logged in and it was my mortgage company, M & T Bank. I had made all of my payments on time and even paid XX/XX/2019 payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I went through my bank statements just to make sure and yes, I had made every single payment, there just was not one listed for XX/XX/XXXX because I made it on XX/XX/2019. I emailed the company on their website listing dates and amounts that were paid ( I have attached a copy of the email and their response ) The XX/XX/XXXX payment was made on XX/XX/2019 for the payment amount of {$490.00}. The payment I tried to make early for XX/XX/XXXX was paid on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$560.00}. I paid extra to pay down late fees that I have incurred. Imagine my surprise when in the response from the bank, they told me that they did not show me making a payment of {$490.00} on XX/XX/2019. She asked me to fax the information over if I had proof otherwise which I did on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX, I am attaching the fax confirmation sheet. On Friday, XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from the bank dated XX/XX/2019 stating that they will investigate and let me know what they find. The letter states that I owe for XX/XX/XXXX ( which I do not ) and now it is XX/XX/XXXX and I owe for XX/XX/XXXX also. My credit report shows that I did not make a payment for XX/XX/XXXX, which is false, I sent them a statement from every month showing all of the payments I made. I also had a problem with my mortgage insurance and had to get new. My new company sent them the information in XX/XX/2019 to have insurance begin XX/XX/2019 and to be put in escrow. The company did not pay the bill for the escrow and beginning XX/XX/2019 raised my payment to include their insurance. My payment went from {$490.00} a month to {$780.00}. They would not accept payment for the mortgage only and did not pay the escrow for that. So I went back to the insurance agency and did a new policy that began in XX/XX/2019 but I still had to pay the outrageous amount of {$800.00} because they still did not pay the escrow and I had bounced a check so I added the {$20.00} to that payment, which I told the girl when I called that is what it was for, and yet it still shows I owe a {$20.00} NSF fee which I have attached a copy of my online account because it also STILL shows I owe for XX/XX/XXXX and now XX/XX/XXXX. As of today, XX/XX/2019, they have not paid my insurance to escrow and it will be cancelled on XX/XX/2019 if they do not. I have gone back and forth with this company and they are never willing to help even when it is their fault. I can't afford to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and so I will be going into default soon.

Student loan,"Currently to pay your loan serviced by Navient over the phone you have to give your full social security number ( SSN ) or your account number. The option of giving my full SSN to the employee that answered my call to verify the account means that this employee  already has access to my SSN and not an abbreviated version of it. It concerns me that people at this level of employment have access to this detailed information. In today 's society with security breaches that seek to steal peoples personal information and the ramification of these known issues gravely concerns me that Navient would open themselves and their customers to such a large liability. The amount of customer service representatives that have access to this information not only nationwide but globally is extremely concerning. I hope my concern gives rise to the potential damage to the more than 12 million debtors that Navient currently services. 

The only employees that should have access to this information should be at the point that they are in litigation about payment of loans. Trying to pay my loan which is reducing my debt and not adding to it should not have such revealing information attached to the process."

I got a total of 3 different rings for them. The 1st time my husband order online in XX/XX/XXXXand when the ring came in it looked a lot smaller than it was online. So we returned it to our local Zales Outlet Store in XXXX, IL on XX/XX/XXXX. 

We then purchased the 2nd ring on XX/XX/XXXX and when I was offered the promotion I declined it because I use to work for XXXX XXXX and they use to finance for XXXX XXXX once the 18-24 month of promotion would end they would get hit with anywhere from $ XXXX {$3000.00} worth of interest on their appliance so I rather pay the interest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we purchased the 3rd and final ring we bought. The young lady was suppose to do an exchange, however she stated that she had to do a return then buy the new ring. After she returned she was having some issues with getting me the new ring because Zales kept declining my card. Finally they stated they needed to speak with me when the young lady called the credit department. After doing some verification they finally let the sale go through. 

So if I went from paying interest to a promotion I was unaware of it until yesterday. Well I get a notice from one of my credit monitoring on yesterday that stated that one of my cards are over the limits. It stated Zales. Please find the statements attached. It shows that I was paying interest on the 2nd purchase but changed on the 3rd purchase  unbeknownst to me."
Debt collection,I recently filed a dispute with CFPB regarding NCC business Services reporting incorrect amounts on my credit report as well as re-aging the dates on my credit report. I also stated how NCC business service refused to respond to my validation request that was sent to them by certified mail. NCC responded stating that they reached out to the landlord and stated incorrect dates that were supposedly given to them by the landlord and that they did respond to my validation request which is also untrue. In my dispute I provided a copy of a civil judgement that was discharged listing a date and amount that is different from what NCC is reporting. According to the FDCPA a collection agency CAN NOT verify a debt only a creditor can. Im requesting that CFPB submit proof that original creditor verified the  accuracy of their reporting amounts and dates. NCC also claimed that I broke my lease in XXXX of 2013 but on my credit report it has an expiration date of XXXX of 2013. NCC stated that they in fact responded to my VALIDATION letter in which I attached a certified mail receipt proving that my letter was sent and received. Its only fair that NCC attach proof that they in fact sent me a response letter as well as a copy of the validation letter that was supposedly sent to my address. Im also requesting that NCC also submit proof that I gave them permission to even contact me regarding this alleged debt. Im also requesting proof that I gave NCC business services permission to use my PII to establish an account on my behalf-which can be a form of identity theft. i did send a copy of my drivers license and social to NCC which was after they placed this negative information on my credit report and created an account in my name without my consent. Im also requesting proof that NCC provided me with a 30 day notice before placing the alleged amounts on my credit report. NCC is not only violating my rights and the laws within the FDCPA but have caused me tremendous amount of stress but had also caused my credit to be damaged. I also request that instead of NCC sending me the proofs that Im requesting I would rather they attach with their response to this complaint.

They said they could not help me that it needed to post first. How could my bank let this happen to me. They are there to protect their customers. I guess it's not their money so they didn't care. We went to the police station right away to file a claim because now we don't have the money or a rental ( took us 5 hours to get there from where we live ). We had to scramble and try to find a rental which was not in our budget but we had no other option. Upon returning home, I called TD Bank and filed a claim. I was told that this would be taken care of and she apologized to me and said I would be credited back the money. She told me to get the police report and fax it to them. Two weeks later I was able to get the police report and faxed it to TD Bank. Three weeks go by and I still haven't heard anything. I called them today and they said there's nothing they can do. I told them it's their fault because I trusted their site and why would they have apps on their site that were not verified. They make me go through hoops when I'm out of town but yet they let anyone set up fake accounts and transfer money??? They are supposed to protect their customers but this is not the case. He rep told me to go to law enforcement and see what they can do for me. I already filed a claim with the MA police department as soon as this happened. This is ridiculous! I will no longer be doing business with TD Bank since they do not protect their customers from fraudulent transactions. That app should not be associated with their site at all if they can't verify the customers that use it."
Debt collection,"Around XX/XX/2018, there was were faulty plumbing, wiring, and heating unit issues in the property I was renting/leasing at the time. I was told by the landlord that it would get taken care of immediately. It never get taken care of, as a result, the electric bill for one month alone was over {$1000.00} due to these faulty issues. The landlord was supposed to pay this bill, since it was his fault. However, instead this was charged to me. I was not informed this would affect my credit, but since I could not get any hep from the landlord, I did my best to pay this debt anyway. I never received any notice that this would be transferred to collections. However, when collections did call me earlier this year, I still attempted to settle the debt by getting on a payment plan for the sake of my credit. They told me that this would not be reported negatively on my credit report if I began a payment plan. So I proceeded. I have discovered that that they STILL reported negatively on my credit report, and this is hurting me terribly. All this for a debt I do not even owe. I can not get any help on this matter from the company collecting the debt currently listed on my credit report CREDIT MANAGEMENT LP. I also could not get help from XXXX XXXX XXXX who initially charged me such an outrageous bill from a faulty home that the landlord was supposed to repair. I was never even notified in writing about the outstanding balance or that it would be sent to collections. I spite of all this, I am still on the payment plan and am working to pay off this debt I should not owe as agreed when promised it would not affect my credit report if I took action. With that said, I would like to please get this negative remark removed from my credit report ASAP. Although I wish I did not have to pay this at all, I understand someone needs to pay it and I know my former landlord will not. I truly appreciate any effort on this issue."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There are errors on my credit report that need to be removed.
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a query through XXXX XXXX for a cash out refinance. The first lender I spoke to was Supreme Lending who offered one of the lowest rates and also noted I would not need an appraisal, which was part of the reason I chose to work with them. I told the loan officer if they could match the lower rate that came through with another lender I would refinance with Supreme. After a day, he confirmed I would get the lower rate ( though he did not mention I had to buy down to that rate until a later time ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the loan officer emailed saying we didnt get approval not to do an appraisal. This was the first time it was mentioned no appraisal would require an approval. In that email, he also told me we would get the fee waived and if not hed make up for it. I paid {$720.00} for an appraisal that took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the loan officer told me to make up for the issues with no waiver my first payment would be pushed to XXXX instead of XXXX. He explained this would happen via a refund check through over payment of my old mortgage. 

I closed on XX/XX/XXXX and he assured me that morning prior to signing that Id receive a refund check covering my first full payment long before my due date in XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had no check and emailed asking the loan XXXX the status of my refund check since I received notice Supreme had already sold my mortgage. He called and stated I needed to wait until 3 full weeks from funding had passed and that would be XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX I still had no check. I emailed again. He told me he was out of office but looking into it the next day when he returned. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, he called to say he was escalating it and would update me the next day. On XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed asking for an update since I had not heard any update. I received no response and emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX letting him know I would be reporting and escalating the issue myself if not resolved before the XX/XX/XXXX holiday. 

After all the communication of the past two months ensuring me things would be handled, the loan officer then told me on XX/XX/XXXX, the day my first payment was due, that Supreme had to pay more for my old mortgage because the former mortgage company increased the pay off amount and there was no overage to provide me a refund That was not true as they actually decreased the pay off amount originally provided and confirmed that when I called them on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I emailed the loan officer the exact summary above on XX/XX/XXXX. He replied that he'd forward my email to the "" powers that be '' and has not provided any update. He has called but left no voicemail. He emailed to say to call him but provided no details. I informed him he could provide an update via email. He has not done so. 

The entire experience and misleading information around not needing an appraisal and then assuring I'd be made whole is deceptive practice by Supreme Lending to obtain business."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received in the mail an unsolicited and unwanted credit card, apparently affiliated with a timeshare. I did not activate the card. 
I was shocked to subsequently receive a billing statement in XXXX albeit with XXXX  due amount. I called the company to ascertain what exactly happened. I notified the company, Barclay bank that I neither was informed of any credit card application ; nor authorized ; nor signed any application. 
I spoke to five different employees, one twice ( XXXX ) in Customer Service, Fraud, and a Supervisor. I was appalled to learn Barclays perspective - that the timeshare company ( Wyndham  ) has the opinion I authorized the card. 
Not only have I received negative impact to my credit score by issuing this card fraudulently, cancelling it becomes another adverse credit event. This is unacceptable, and I seek your assistance to rectify this atrocious conduct."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, I went to use my XXXX XXXX card, the merchant refused to take my card stating it has been reported as stolen. I looked at my XXXX   credit report, which has dropped points on my report - and in fact, card shows stolen. I contacted the credit card company. They opened an investigation as it shows I has reported the card stolen. It told them that was not the case. As a result of investigation, they concluded that Equifax has reported the card stolen, put a 90 days hold in my account, and took points off my report. I submitted a dispute with Equifax, but because I did not chose to pay for their services, I am unable to retrieve my report. They keep sending me emails telling me to get my report. To my surprised, the site has been down for three weeks. I attached a copy of this. I called them to no help. They claimed they could not figure out who I was after their questions where not understood. Ex : you have a bank loan? I asked which loan - they said we can't identified you. I have more than one bank loan. 
I emailed them, they asked me to email a bogus email address, who stated they did not handle reports. Everyday, I try to enter the site and I still can't get my report. So this situation has created stress plus I continue to see incorrect information in my report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX came to my door to shampoo 3 rooms, and I let them. Long 3 hours went by, and I knew my credit would not be approved because I was not working, my husband is the only one. So, I said sure, run my credit. Well, a few min later, they said I was approved. I asked the salesman how, and he said they only used my info, but used my husbands earnings. Anyway, later that night, I explained to husband, he said nope, they jipped me. In the meantime, I was supposed to go on my email to sign the financial loan documents. I had 3 days to rescind and give vacuum back. I looked on my email, started doing paperwork, then I quit. I was asked on a form for my drivers license info, I actually never finished the paperwork. I also in the meantime tried to contact the salesman to please come back and get vacuum. I could not get him, his boss. I tried for over a week. Well, after that, one of the reps from XXXX said that XXXX XXXX needed my drivers license info, that I needed to call them or the contract was void. I never gave them info, and never actually seen a contract containing my interest or anything. The XXXX salesman had put all my info in the site and set me up for auto pay. Long story short, a couple months passed, I got out the owners manual to learn how to use the attachments. I found a copy of my credit app folded in it. The salesman had wrote in that I got XXXX a month XXXX!! Really!! Its such a ripoff all the way around. Please, please help with this"
Student loan,"AES Team, I was informed about the XXXX Loan Forgiveness program a few years ago by AES reps on several seperate occasions. However, I was not properly informed about all the features of this program ; specifically XXXX Loan Forgiveness Forbearance. I was not properly informed that during the 5 year period, you can annually apply for forbearance while completing the 5 years eligibility at a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told my only forbearance option was General Forbearance which lasts less than 1 year. Had I been informed of this during the initial consult with AES reps I would have immediately applied for this special forbearance annually. 

I am now finishing up my 5th year at a title 1 school and are ready to have my loans forgiven. However, I am requesting retro active forbearance for 4 years ( XXXX XXXX ) in which I was eligible for the XXXX Loan Forgiveness Forbearance but was not advised of my eligibility for it. The XXXX loan forgiveness forbearance was the BEST repayment option for my specific circumstance over the past 4 years and AES failed to advise me of that. As a result, I have 2 90 day late payments on my credit report that could have been avoided had I been given correct information by AES reps. 

I know AES is all about helping its customers whos loans it services have the most pleasant experience ; especially its XXXX who serve in XXXX XXXX XXXX where we serve children from difficult life circumstances. I know AES has the best intentions to offer solutions to make the repayment process pleasant. However, the ball was dropped in my circumstance. 

This retroactive forbearance would rectify the unfortunate situation of not fulfilling their duty to inform me the best forbearance solution over the past 4 years. I know this is an abnormal request. However, given the extent of the circumstances I think you will agree that my request is fair and something that I am more than eligible for and entitled to as a XXXX XXXX XXXX that was not properly informed. Thank you for your time. 

I have tried on several occasions to rectify this with AES directly to no avail. 

Forgiveness Forbearance A XXXX  Loan Forgiveness Forbearance can be requested while you are completing the 5 years of teaching service at an eligible XXXX XXXX XXXX. The forbearance will be applied in 1 year increments, so you must reapply annually."
Debt collection,"About a year and a half ago I purchased a membership to XXXX over Texas. I paid off the membership, and have provided proof to the debt company that it has been paid off. I have been harassed for months about this issue. I have issued verbal and written statements that they are not allowed to call me again, that the debt was paid, and that they have received proof of payment. They have acknowledged all of this, yet they continue to call, sometimes multiple times a day, and harass me at home and at school. They have used intimidation tactics, such as saying if I do not pay the debt in full they will destroy my credit. They have talked to my father, invading my privacy and causing emotional and social stress. They have not, as they said they would, sent me proof that the debt is owed. It has been more than 30 days. They are being fraudulent and negligent. They have reported it, falsely, and it is impacting my credit negatively and harming my ability to take out loans to pay for college and get an apartment."

Checking or savings account,"I opened an AnyDeposit Checking Account with Bank of the West on XX/XX/XXXX. There was a promotion of {$150.00} Bonus if I did certain requirements. {$100.00} for a Direct Deposit and another {$50.00} if I used my Debit Card to do 10 POS Transactions during the 2 months following the month I opened my account ( i.e. XXXX and XXXX ). It was mentioned that the payment will be issued by XX/XX/XXXX. Yet I received nothing. 

To be sure, I talked few times with the customer service. Once was on XX/XX/XXXX for some general questions about the bonus. Once on XX/XX/XXXX to confirm that I am eligible and that I am doing the right steps. Then once on XX/XX/XXXX ( after I fulfilled all the requirements ). I was told then that I QUALIFY and I SHOULD BE receiving the bonus by XX/XX/XXXX, On XX/XX/XXXX, I gave Bank of the West a call asking them if I will be receiving the Bonus in the next 2 days ( I've known people that have already received their bonus by mid of XXXX or a little bit after ). That's when a supervisor informed me that I don't qualify cause someone from Mid of XX/XX/XXXX until mid of XX/XX/XXXX claimed the same bonus living at the same address I am in ( I am aware of this fine print detail ) .However I have been living at the same address since almost 2 years and I've asked other tenants residing in the same address if they actually deal with Bank of the West , None had any accounts with Bank of the West. 

I am not sure how Bank of the West is claiming that someone residing in the same address collected the same bonus over the last 2 years. It is clear that they don't want to pay out the bonus. I stepped into a Bank of the West in XXXX to try to resolve the problem. This was on XX/XX/XXXX and I've spoken with the branch manager and promised to call me the following day after consulting with the office that is responsible for paying out the bonuses. Branch manager didn't call me. I went once again on XX/XX/XXXX, then I was promised that I will receive a call after few hours. Nothing again. Today is Monday XX/XX/XXXX and it's already almost XXXX XXXX  and I didn't received a phone call today as well.

It has now been over 60 days and I'm still fighting with Transunion to remove the items as they not correct. I spoke with Manager XXXX at Transunion and he stated he would remove the items again, but I'm getting really frustrated with the fact that each month I have to call and ask them to remove the items as they aren't correct and it's causing me many problems as I am the process of purchasing home.

I spoke to the Kohls representative inquiring about account status and was advised that I was 60 days delinquent as of that dayXX/XX/19. I was confused because the last payment made covered 2 months. I asked has this information reported delinquent to the credit bureaus and the Kohls representative advised they do not report 30 days and report the first delinquency at 60 days and since today is the 60th day if payment were received Kohls would not report the late payment. I said, are you sure? He stated yes, and I then provided my information to bring the account current. Before ending the call I asked if he could provide something in writing the account would not report and he said no, but I work for Kohls and this will not report as past due. On XX/XX/2019 I received updates from all bureaus that Kohls reported 30 days delinquent. I now see this as a deceptive inhouse collections practice used to collect a payment and probably a cash incentive. This type of practice is not allowed per FDCPA and based on his conversation with me I request the delinquencies be removed from all bureaus. I spoke to XXXX a manager in the XXXX XXXX office that says she is sending a request to corporate to remove the late reports, however she has no last name and did not sound confident in her communication.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, On XX/XX/2019 while checking out at a XXXX XXXX  store located in XXXX, CT, I was asked if I would be interested in the store rewards card. Assuming this was just a card that accumulated points for purchases in store, I agreed. 

However, when the cashier began to ask me for my social security number, drivers license, etc. I asked why she needed that information. She replied it was necessary for the store rewards card. As I believed this to only be a store card I provided the requested information. 

At no point in this process did the cashier indicate in any way that this was a credit card application. If she had I would have immediately declined as I had no desire for another credit card. When she informed me that I had been approved I was flabbergasted and asked why she had not told me this was a credit card. Her response was that she had told me it was a store rewards card. 

As this was a Saturday ; I contacted the creditor, Synchrony Bank, on Monday, XX/XX/2019 to have them cancel this card and asked them to remove this inquiry from my credit report. The representative was helpful and cancelled the card and told me he would forward my request to have the inquiry removed. I emphatically told him that I was intentionally misled and not informed that this was a credit card application. He indicated he would provide that information. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a response from Synchrony Bank, copy attached, in which they informed me that as I had provided the necessary information for their paperless credit card application they were not able to remove this credit inquiry. They went on to inform me that compliance is very important to them and they follow all applicable laws as outlined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). If that is so, then their employees should disclose to customers that they are applying for a CREDIT CARD and not a STORE REWARDS CARD. 

Additionally, they state in their letter to me that it was fully disclosed to me on the application that Synchrony Bank would access my credit file when processing my application. However, as this was a paperless application as they stated, how would I have known that? They clearly have contradicted themselves in this instance. 

As I was misled ; whether intentional or not ; this practice clearly is in violation of the FCRA in which a consumer needs to be fully informed of what they are applying for. Im sure I am not the only consumer that may have been impacted by this practice ; not only at this store. This may be their store practice to encourage their employees with incentives on accounts opened. 

I respectfully ask that this inquiry be removed from my credit report immediately."

Checking or savings account,"I opened an account with TCF called premier 50 in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. My account number ends in # XXXX I was not aware that they were going to charge these accelerated fees for nsf checks which they did me in XX/XX/XXXX, for over {$500.00} dollars. My account was only due a charge of {$35.00} or {$70.00} when I learned that I had an overdraft balance. 

I contacted the bank regarding this ruling asking for a reversal of this amount because I was not aware of this change. There were never any signs posted, nothing in the newspapers, etc that these accelerated charges were about to happen. Since most of the time, I used internet banking, nothing was listed to refer me to this change in policy. 

Also, there was no information regarding this change at the teller windows. It was almost as if it was hidden since I had opted for statements on line. During the same time I was complaining the television stations carried the story of the upset customers and claims were made to the XXXX   controller and Senator XXXX XXXX 's office. TCF still did not reverse these fees. I would have never agreed these fees or services.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My auto insurance agency notified me they were unable to review my coverage because TransUnion was providing address information contrary to all other records. I attempted to get a copy of my credit record via telephone ; after 10 minutes of pushing buttons and listening to voice prompts the automated voicemail system tells me it can't release any information because my data does not match theirs. It directs me to the TransUnion website, which I must register with to obtain any information. What was not disclosed was registration to the TransUnion website automatically sucks {$27.00} out of your checking account and signs you up at monthly membership rates. What I thought was going to give me a free copy of my credit report was a deception. The subscription fees may have been hidden in the fine print in the link at the bottom of the registration page, I certainly never found it. 

Short version : TransUnion created a situation with my car insurance that they refused to fix or even give any details about until they extorted {$27.00} from the victim of their misinformation. Being a XXXX person on a very limited income, I can't afford to let this slide."
Mortgage,"DITECH is committing mortgage fraud. DITECH is printing two invoices, from my account, in a single 30 day period with erroneous data. One invoice shows my payment on time and the second one does not. They use the second invoice to show the credit bureaus I did not make a payment, when in fact I have made the payment on time and in whole. DITECH is causing me harm and others like me. I want DITECH to provide to the CFPB what month I was late with invoices and bank statements, and I will show the bank statement and DITECH invoice that shows every single payment on time for the past 12+ years. Due to the fact, I have never missed a payment nor have I never not sent the whole amount as per the mortgage contract.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently submitted a request for investigation of a which you refused. I submitted enough information for you to carry out a reasonable investigation of my dispute, since you obviously did not investigate this account thoroughly enough the last time I submitted one. They have already verified one of these fraudulent accounts and has removed that account. They have stated when I have called them, that they have contacted your agency numerous times to have the other account removed to no avail, often noting unreasonable hold times to get through to the fraud department. XXXX  will also not allow me to do these disputes online. 

If you had investigated properly, rather than use your XXXX system, you would have known, that not only have ever been late on this account, but that I am not the owner of this account, though your company claims to have verified this. 

It is at this time that I will point out that in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX v. XXXX ( XXXX  ),  and XXXX v. XXXX, Equifax, et al, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldn't merely "" parrot '' information from the creditors and collection agencies ... that they have to conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and the honesty/integrity of the creditor/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the XXXX  system that does not even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

Additionally, the following accounts do not belong to me and have been removed by the other credit bureaus and deemed fraudulent : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  If you do not initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been in a dispute process since XX/XX/2017.

You have NOT provided me a copy of ANY original documentation required under Section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) & Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ( a consumer contract with my signature on it ) and under Section 611 ( 5 ) ( A ) of the FCRA you are required to promptly DELETE all information which can not be verified.

Even the dispute confirm what I'm saying and even I have phone to claim this, still the reports is showing this remark. 

- I requested a month ago to check a paytment it was done to the only loan I'm carrying, with XXXX, but Transunion has deleted the account instead show this paytment. I have check with XXXX, the creditor, and they assure they didn't take any action and that they are reporting all the paytments."

The credit reporting agency didn't responsibly investigate the account. Later I know that this account was opened by a person who has a similar name with me in the same apartment building. However, he has a different apartment number as me. Equifax mistakenly matched his data with mine. Equifax 's investigation didn't find this and its system still mixed my file with the other 's."

I explained that I did not agree to XXXX. I needed XXXX. 
They said well it's too late because the check had already been sent to XXXX. 
I tried again to explain that I did not agree to XXXX and I do not agree to your terms. 
I ask if the check had been cashed and they said no. So I asked them to place a stop payment on that check they mailed to XXXX on XXXX. 
They said the couldn't stop pay on a check until 21 days had passed after the date of mailings I tried to explain that that rule is for when a check had not been received. 
I was unable to speak to anyone in accounting who would know what a stop payment ment and how to implement that process. 
I sent letters, I called several times but all I got was a letter saying they had the right to choose the amount of credit. 
No answer to the fact they did not seek my approval for that amount and the fact I never agreed to their terms. 
I see this as a fraud. Get people to apply for a loan, give no info on the amount or terms and only allow them to speak to customer service who is not equipped to handle these issues. 
I wrote a letter, sent back the statements with notes but they refused to intelligently address the issue. 
What I need now is to have First Bank remove their reporting to the top 3 credit reporting agencies.FYIi XXXX cashed the check on XXXX"

I had already emailed her on XX/XX/2018, attaching my official Annual Report for 2018 that I filed with the North Carolina XXXX of XXXX XXXX showing that I was the sole member of the XXXX and requested her to remove said former partner from my bank account. 
This branch bank XXXX intentionally avoided removing my former partner from the company bank account ; then deliberately avoided processing new Bank signature cards that were signed on XX/XX/2018 that specifically showed that the former partner was Not permitted access to my company bank account. I am quite certain that she also infomed my former partner that I was going to close the bank account so he hurried to his local branch bank and made the illegal withdrawal. 
I hold both the banking institution and the XXXX XXXX liable for reimbursement of {$8500.00} plus damages that have occurred, limiting my business operations and generally causing a great amount of despair."

I've been using them for years for the same exact service. But this time it was very different. I sent the transfer on XX/XX/2018 ; the amount is {$480.00} directly deposited from my bank account. The company charged {$25.00} fee, so the final amount was {$500.00}. They withdrew the full amount from my bank account of Tuesday, XX/XX/2018. However, the transfer was not available for pick up till late night on Thursday, XX/XX/2018. When the receiver tried to get the transfer, it was declined for some unexplained "" security '' issues. I have to note one more time that I do this operation once a month for years, so if there were security issues they should have been cleared by now.

When I talked to an agent of MoneyGram they said that they will credit the money back to my account but it might take up to ten business days. 
So MoneyGram is working my money out in their own interest and don't feel obligated to return it. I just hope this issue will be resolved and other people will not have to deal with this problem trying to return their own money back.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My complaint is specifically with Experian. First of all it is impossible to talk to a human being, I tried several times and even tried a hack on the Internet ( pushing XXXX instead of XXXX ) and none of them work. I tried to temporarily lift a freeze on my bureau so I could apply for a loan. I tried online and it refuses to accept my User Name and Password ( I know it is correct because I wrote it down and place in my safe when I put the freeze on ). When I ask to have my user name emailed to me it accepts but I never receive the email ( requested XXXX times over the past 12 hours ). I call the "" Customer Service '' number and I get a machine. The machine permanently removed the freeze instead of temporarily suspending it. I tried to fix and since it is impossible to talk to a person I was unable to do so. This company needs to be put on your hit list to fine billions of dollars like you do the banks! At least banks have a customer service department that tries to actually help their customers. Credit Bureau 's seem to think they are immune to any sort of responsibility to their customers! This has got to stop!"
Student loan,"I took out my XXXX XXXX loan in order to go to college. I was told when I signed up that I would get the best customer service. However, ever since I have graduated in XX/XX/XXXX, I have had nothing but trouble from them. They immediately came after me for {$550.00} a month. I was able to get my account placed on a Graduate  payment plan, but once it ended, I still was struggling to make payments as a recent graduate. When I contacted them, in XX/XX/XXXX and requested assistance in the form of refinancing due to an increase in my credit score, they refused and instead they placed me on an interest only repayment plan for {$300.00} a month, despite the fact that my cosigner had amazing credit. After that, they would make disrespectful, harassing and occasionally threatening calls to myself and my cosigner, who was in the hospital during one of  these calls. While I understand that they are a business, these calls came when I was only two days late in payment, and when I had already called XXXX XXXX and informed them that I was waiting on a paycheck and then they would get their money. At one point, the person I spoke with talked down to me and told me that until I "" learned to pay on time, I would continue getting the calls. '' Again, this would occur when I was only two to five days behind in payment on a {$300.00} dollar payment as a recent graduate. I have never been more than 28 days past due, and every time I have been past due has been due to some reason I can't control and that XXXX XXXX refuses to work with me on. Now, after a year of these "" interest only payments '', my repayment plan is almost up and at the beginning of this year, my balance went up {$8000.00} and they expect me to begin paying them {$550.00} a month come XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. Every time I request some form of help due to being unable to handle the bill and support myself, they refused. I have no issues paying my bills, I am an accountant and I know bills must be paid.

I never thought to check the information but found out the hard way after my car was totaled out. Insurance then pushed me to get a new vehicle or be without a car or get a rental at my own expense. I spoke with the Avid Acceptance whom told me they would not finance me until my current loan was paid off. I had to go through another company to get a car for my family, clothes, place to live etc. XXXX has been calling my boss stating that I gave her as a personal reference apparently she gets so many calls she begged me to call him, and tell him to stop calling her. I was not made aware that I could make this complaint or even if something will be done about it. I just need him to stop calling my boss. I have tried to negotiate to get this debt taken care of but what I can afford and what they want me to pay are two different things. I can not even get on the website to make some kind of payment because he says he can not agree with it."
Debt collection,"I went to check my credit score on XXXX XXXX ( as I do several times a month ), and I noticed a significant dip in my credit score from one of the reporting agencies ( nearly XXXX points ).

The account stated that I owed {$690.00} and that the account was opened XXXX XXXX 2016. The collection account was reported to the credit reporting agencies on XXXX XXXX, 2016.

The assignment was supposedly executed in XXXX and the XXXX companies involved did not have the mortgage. The documents were never recorded in XXXX XXXX records until another mortgage company by the name of Aurora loan services bought the mortgage. Since it is supposed to be recorded in XXXX XXXX records within a certain amount of time in relation to the closing date, I feel these companies have acted fraudulently. The assignment of mortgage was allegedly signed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX. The assignment was not recorded in XXXX XXXX records of XXXX until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Where did this document sit for all that time? This document supposedly sat in limbo and then mysteriously appeared in XXXX, when Aurora loan services bought the loan. I feel there has been fraudulent activity and do not feel that the assignment of mortgage that was recorded is valid or legal. I would also like to add that XXXX XXXX Mortgage XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX are XXXX separate entities. So XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX would not have had the legal authority to assign my mortgage to XXXX and why would the recorded document be returned to Aurora Loan Services and not XXXX?"

I have never made a transaction against the account. My current account balance is {$790.00}. They have taken my money by charging me a {$3.00} per month service fee on the account ( 6 % of the principle every month ) for no reason whatsoever. The used the title of "" Online Payment # XXXX '' for these monthly service fees to disguise their nature. These were not online payments to a third party. They were UMB Bank taking money out of my account for themselves. They added this fee after XXXX opened the account for me. They also started, without my knowledge or consent, charging a {$1.00} per month fee for a paper statement ( statements which I never asked for but they decided to send ). This is just theft.

Student loan,"I have numerous complaints about my loan servicing company, Navient, and was only allowed to select one issue on the previous page. I can enumerate all of the issues below : Initially, I have always been a public servant when repaying my student loans, and have always attempted to be qualified for the public service loan forgiveness program.

1. I was given completely incorrect information regarding payment plans, payment amounts, and was not provided the right information regarding the lowest payment possible. For the first several years ( XXXX ) I was not making the lowest payment possible. I found out many years later that I could have qualified for payments under {$100.00} a month, but was paying 2 or 3 times that amount at any point.

2. I took out a mortgage on my home to pay down my balances. I made it VERY clear that I wanted the payment to go towards the principal balance. Yet, Navient ( around XX/XX/XXXX ) repeatedly applied the balance to future payments. For nearly 3 months I repeatedly called Navient to have them apply the balance to the principal. I am still unsure if they charged me interest on the larger principal balance during that time. 

3. I was told in XXXX or XXXX of XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not have to certify my student loans for PSLF until I had made 120 payments, and that Navient was keeping track of those payments. However, I recently found that many of my coworkers certify their employment on an annual basis, and that their loans are held by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted, once a month, for the last 18 months ( XX/XX/XXXX to present day ) to get information from Navient regarding any PSLF certification paperwork. They REPEATEDLY told me they would send me information via email or mail, and I would never receive this paperwork. Finally, I went online and did a search on my own. I have attempted to get documentation regarding my numerous phone calls and was told they do not email others. Further, I was told that they do not keep any log of calls made by borrowers."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2018 I was notified by XXXX  XXXX that there was a "" recent '' hard inquiry from a company doing business as XXXX XXXX XXXX that appeared on my Equifax credit report. I immediately XXXX this company to inquire on who they are. I contacted them on XX/XX/2018 to check into this matter because I did not authorize a credit check of any sort from this company or any other company in the past 9 months. XXXX XXXX XXXX apologized and claimed that these unauthorized inquiries happen often. They advised me to contact the credit bureau that shows this inquiry to have it removed. XXXX XXXX claims that they are not a "" creditor '' and are not able to get this removed. At that point, on XX/XX/2018 I contacted Equifax about this matter. Equifax told me that they are unable to remove this unauthorized inquiry and that I needed to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX to initiate the request for removal since XXXX is the company that pulled my credit report without my authorization. From that point, which was XX/XX/2018 I have spoken with several people from both companies and neither are willing to fixed this problem. They both continue to tell me that the other needs initiate the process to have that inquiry removed. At this point, I personally feel that Equifax should take the high road and remove this unauthorized inquiry from my credit report. My dispute confirmation number with Equifax is XXXX. I was never given a case or complaint number with XXXX XXXX XXXX as they explained to me that Equifax would have to initiate a case or claim on my behalf prior to their fraud dept investigating my claim of fraud. Please help."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2018 I attempted to submit a {$300.00} payment to USAA for my auto loan. But I received an error stating "" Currently we are unable to process your payment due to a system error. Please submit this payment later. ( XXXX ) ''. I reached out to USAA online support directly after receiving the error and they stated "" XXXX XXXX : Good to hear! I apologize you are unable to make a payment to your loan. We are currently experiencing technical difficulties. Our technical specialists are fully aware and are working aggressively to resolve the issue. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you. I do not have a timeframe of when this will be fixed, however, please check in within 1-2 hours to resubmit your payment ''. So the next day XX/XX/2018 I made a {$300.00} payment for my auto loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my bank account and seen two withdrawals listed on my account history for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted USAA to make them aware of the situation and provided them my external bank records to show the multiple withdrawals of {$300.00}. USAA stated initially they didn't see the payment, But then stated that they could see it, but it did not post to my auto loan. USAA called my external bank ( XXXX Convenience XXXX with me on the phone to get the tracer number ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for the {$300.00}. I asked USAA for a provisional credit the say no and they also stated they could not reverse my auto loan payment because it would make my account delinquent. On XX/XX/2018 I filed a claim with my external bank for the {$300.00} and I was credited the next day. But USAA reversed my car payment making auto loan delinquent. I didn't know they reversed my auto loan payment until USAA called me Saturday XX/XX/2018 asking for payment. I was transferred to executive resolutions where they stated they don't know why it was reversed and should not have been reversed. XXXX with USAA 's executive resolutions said she reached out to the back office and they researching to see where the funds went. Also stated that I could not get my money back until they see which department it went too. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called from USAA stating they located the funds in a back ledger and they were being processed back to my auto loan backdated to XX/XX/XXXX. She said it would take 24-48 hours. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX called stating that the back office is having trouble locating the funds and asked for a tracer number which i told her that its in their system because we called and got it previously. She quickly looked it up and seen the tracer number. She said she would forward the information for further research to the back office. I called USAA XX/XX/XXXX to ask about for a status update of the {$300.00} and was told they have no information."

We have tried negotiating with them sinceXX/XX/XXXX as we do not want the home to go to foreclosure but it has all been in vain. We have lost several offers due to them not willing to come to any terms and automatically close the file as soon as we submit a new short sale request. We don't believe that PNC Bank is negotiating in good faith and is neglecting to cooperate. It is customary that, regardless of the debt, 2nd lien holders get up to {$6000.00} which is what they are being offered. We currently have an active offer for {$900000.00}, we do not want to loose the buyers after all the work that has been done to help our clients avoid foreclosure and this is why we are turning to you for help as you are our last resource."

XXXX then sent the amount to the collection and every time I tell collection agency that it has been returned, they sell it to other collection agencies. 
I reached out to Transunion to correct the reporting but they reach out to XXXX who keeps confirming. Both TUC and XXXX are ignoring refund receipt. 

I have to pay a higher interest rate due to collection and more recently denied credit due to the collection on my report. I have called XXXX but they keep saying that the account is in the collection and they can not open my file. so I am in a vicious loop trying to correct a wrong item on my credit report. 
I want XXXX to call XXXX  ( phone numbers are there in the attached ) and correct the issue. Also, TUC should not report false items when provided proof of payment."
Checking or savings account,"whom it may concern : On XX/XX/XXXX the balance in my Savings Acct at the Bank of America ( B of A ) was {$80000.00}. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I signed in to my computer to pay my monthly bills only to find out that B of A had debited my account for {$80000.00} leaving me with {$500.00}. I called B of A at XXXX XXXX on the XXXX  of XX/XX/XXXX, only to spend the next hour on the phone with customer service with no success. During most of the hour, ( the last 15 minutes of which I was left on hold ), I was asked many questions about my financial history. Did I ever do this or do that etc. Finally, at XXXX XXXX I hung up from B of A and went across the street to the B of A branch, at which I have my account. The bank representative XXXX XXXX had not the slightest idea what had happened. After one hour and 15 minutes with no success, I left and left my number with Mr. XXXX so that B of A could call me. During the morning I received many calls from B of A, asking many pointless questions like if I had a business : if I had joint accounts at B of A etc. to help them determine what the problem was. At around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, ( 4 hours after this search started ), I received a call from B of A ( XXXX XXXX (? ) saying the debit was for an amount of money B of A had written off years ago. This representative was very sketchy on details and made many erroneous statements ( like arguing that the money was taken from my checking account and not my savings ) trying to justify this debit to my account. I inquired why I had not been contacted. He replied I would be receiving a letter from B of A soon. It is now 5 days and I have seen so such letter. How can a bank pirate a customers account of over $ 80K and there is no communication on the matter?. 
I am a retired senior. I am a twice  XXXX survivor who needs to take meds with a huge co-pay. In XX/XX/XXXX I had XXXX  XXXX and now require drops whose co-pay over {$100.00} per prescription plus a XXXX XXXX that requires an additional prescription with a co-pay of {$120.00}. Also I have to take XXXX XXXX XXXX pills daily. My mortgage and other direct monthly payments are funded from this account. I have XXXX  XXXX scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX. I have expenses associated with this. 
I cant believe that B of A, after being with them for over twenty years, would seize my money. My life is now in a total tailspin. To add insult to injury, the B of A representative said they left the {$500.00} in the account to save me the service fee that would be charged if the account fell below {$500.00} Thanks a lot, BANK OF AMERICA. Living up to your slogan, "" Life 's better when we're connected. ''"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been trying to reach out to this credit card company about my dispute that was made back in early XX/XX/2018. The credit card is through XXXX XXXX and is issued by XXXX. XXXX handles all their customer service support and XXXX XXXX is behind the scene, with no way of reaching them. After I filed a dispute, they did not provide a provisional credit, therefore, the interest on the balance continued to increase, therefore, I ended up paying my balance. A month later they asked for additional information via mail, which I responded via mail. I have constantly been reaching out for a status and they just continued to say they were working on it until today, XX/XX/XXXX, I get an internet response on my follow up question, stating that they did not receive any additional information that was requested. It is now almost 5 months later, and I am at a loss with my money. This is {$270.00} plus the interest that had been tacked on. 

I had a trip to XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/2018. We received a car from a rental company that continuously stalled on the roads during our first day of receiving it, therefore, was unable to use it. I am also going to mention that we received this car later than our requested time due to the car not being ready and shuttle pick up problems. We returned the car the next day upon their opening and was asked to wait a very long time for the new car to be provided to us. We booked the car for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. We ended up not accepting the next car due to the long wait and the wasted time that it caused us and booked through another company. Essentially, we did not get to use the car rental services at all because of this problem. I asked them for a refund and it was refused by the very rude XXXX. I am still pending status on this dispute with my credit card company until this day."
Mortgage,"I received a letter requesting proof of flood insurance, I followed instructions to upload the flood declarations page as our flood insurance is covered under our HOA. I also faxed it to be double sure since I have no confidence based on past terrible experiences with Roundpoint. A few weeks later I received another letter stating I didn't provide proof so I uploaded and faxed again. Now I received a notice of Lender Placed Coverage charging me over {$2100.00} and stating it's because I never provided proof of flood insurance. Today I called and was hung up on 3 times. I went on their online chat and was told to now email the declaration page to insurance@roundpointmortgage.com which I did. I followed up with a phone call and was on hold over ONE HOUR and then person told me the document I sent was not what they were looking for. However, I am the treasurer of the HOA and provide the same document stating proof of flood insurance for 15 homeowners and it is sufficient. In addition, I looked back at my emails and I had the same issue last year with them with the exact same declaration page with last year 's dates. I feel that I am being scammed and don't know what recourse I have to stop this charge."
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX XXXX has been reporting erroneously for years in multiple ways.

I had just lost my home of 28 years which I ended up paying off when it was mysteriously transferred to XXXX XXXXXXXX ( XXXX was soon taken over by the government and my life savings so to speak was gone forever. ) I was totally uprooted and having to drive more in relocating.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My credit score dropped drastically for no reason. I have e-mailed them and their response was that they would look into it and get back with me which they did not and I have e-mailed them since asking why. No response and crickets with nothing and no answer. My income has not changed, all payments made on time and no more debt, even auto loan paid off with excellent payment record on all cc and autos.

This incorrect reporting of me as an authorized user is harming my credit score and this line item needs to be removed from my credit report."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/18 I did a balance transfer with them and they did a double transfer on two of my credit cards that I wanted paid off. This has been over a month ago now and not resolved. I talked to a manager in late XXXX and she assured me it would be fixed in 2 weeks. Never happened. Talked to another manager in XXXX she assured me it would be fixed and she would call me back in 24-48 hours. Never happened and she never called back. Talked to another manager in XXXX and he said it takes 30 days to fix. Again, that never happened. Filed a XXXX complaint and was contacted by XXXX but I wasn't available to talk to her so she left her name and number. I called her back yesterday and today and left messages to call back and that never happened. Meanwhile the credit card that I have with them is over the limit and I'm sure will be reported and my credit score will be destroyed. On top of that the minimum payment that I was supposed to pay is much more than I would have to pay because of this mistake. Needless to say this is all very frustrating and I need help quickly before my payment is due on the 16th if at all possible. Thank you."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I requested a Fraud Alert be placed on my credit reports to prevent any further unauthorized/fraudulent activity. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$17.00} for a certified letter to Equifax containing a signed and notarized letter regarding the fraudulent/invalid information on my credit report. The certified documents were : signed and notarized, a federal trade commission identity theft affidavit and my drivers license. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received confirmation that Equifax received my certified letter and it's contents. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the credit monitoring website, XXXX, a fee of {$24.00} to refresh my credit reports with all three credit bureaus and I became aware that the fraudulent information with Equifax is still on my credit report. There are fraudulent/invalid addresses and an inquiry which are not mine and did not give permission to anyone as well. 

I have lived at my current residence in XXXX, Ca for over 10 years ( Since XX/XX/XXXX ) and I have never lived out of state. 

In compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Section 611, the credit bureau Equifax has 30 days to review and remove my ( consumer ) complaint. It has been 120 days with no solution or response and now I am submitting a request for help with the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau to resolve this matter as soon as possible."
Debt collection,"The CRA is showing a collections account for {$130.00}. 

I spoke with the company in XX/XX/XXXXbecause information appeared on my credit report that was new. I asked the company to validate the information but they refused I spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and explained that I DID NOT RECEIVE a letter and notice to dispute the account because the collection agency sent information to the wrong address. The collection agency failed to provide validation of the debt and continues to report inaccurate information to the credit bureaus. XXXX XXXX stated that there was another account with my name for {$530.00}. When I asked her where she had sent the notice she refused to state the date and the address that the notice was sent to."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/, my Chase checking account was fraudulently charged for the amount of {$200.00}. The transaction took place at a grocery store an hour away from where I live and attend school. Whoever responsible for the transaction made a small purchase and paid a fee in order to get {$200.00} in cash back, taking almost all the money from my checking account. I have never made a purchase in the city where the transaction took place and my Chase debit card has never left my possession. The morning after I was awoken by several calls from the Chase fraud department alerting me of the potentially fraudulent activity. I immediately checked my account and found that a charge had occurred without my consent. I contacted Chase and began the process of getting a new card, new pin number, and my funds back. This process was simple enough, I received a new card in the mail and went to a branch to assign a new pin to my new card. Chase quickly returned my funds to my account and I assumed the situation had been resolved. I was extremely relieved to have my money back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, the money was taken back out of my account by Chase due to a "" claim reversal ''. I immediately contacted Chase and got in touch with their claims department. I was told that I would need to fax proof of my location on the day of the transaction, and in 3-5 business days my money would be returned to me. I attended both work and class on the day of the transaction however on short notice I was only able to get documentation from my employer that I was clocked in on XX/XX/XXXX an hour away from where the transaction took place. The following day I went into a Chase branch and spoke with a banker who faxed the documentation to the claims department. The banker spoke to the claims department about my case and told me that he did not see any reason I would not get my money back after providing proof. He was informative about the ways that my information could have been stolen and used without my consent. I was told to contact the claims department in 3-5 business days. In the following weeks I contacted the claims department multiple times. I have been told that my claim is being investigated by an outside office and that it is out of the hands of Chase themselves whether I get my money back. The validity of the fraudulent transaction was being investigated despite Chase first notifying me about activity that had been deemed suspicious by their standards. My claim has been denied multiple times despite providing the document from my employer. I finally asked the representative to please connect me with someone who could give me more information. I spoke with an Escalation specialist named XXXX who looked at my claim and made notes of the extra information I gave her. She then submitted the claim for investigation again, which took another 3 to 5 business days. This claim was denied also. I have pleaded with Chase to please give me my money back, I even offered to provide more proof of the location of myself and my mother whose account is connected to mine. I was told that more documentation would not be needed. Without the further documentation, the claim was submitted again and today I received a letter saying that my case was closed and could not be reopened again. I do not know what else to do. The absence of this money set me back tremendously with bills right before the holiday season. I am a student, I work as a server for tips and {$200.00} is sometimes all the money I can make in a whole week. I did not travel an hour away between work and school to a city where I have never purchased anything and pay a fee to get cash back from a grocery store when there is a Chase ATM right down the street from me. My family and I will be closing our Chase checking accounts soon because we no longer trust them with our money and other than consulting an attorney we do not know what else to do about this situation."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I began to review my credit earlier this year and noticed several inaccuracies. Out of an abundance of concern, I requested that VALIDATION in accordance to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act be provided to me timely for my personal and legal review. However, after two separate requests made timely for this, the company has failed to provide me with this validation. 

I have contacted the bankruptcy court that the respective credit bureau is advising "" verified this information as belonging to me and my file. However, upon response, the bankruptcy court advised that this ABSOLUTELY FALSE,  and they do not provide, share, or report bankruptcy case filing data to credit reporting agencies, nor do we update information directly to the credit bureaus. THIS BUREAU HAS OUTRIGHT LIED ACCORDING TO THE DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED TO ME. I have sent the bureau a letter, certified mail with a copy of this letter, as well as a copy of my postmarked envelope as proof of receipt of this document. The certified tags are ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) was received by their office on XX/XX/2019. 
They have yet to delete this from my credit reporting file."
Checking or savings account,"I have had this problem several times but most recently XXXX. Northern Trust out of XXXX, IL processes check payments for a number of banks. I work in a shared office space with a single address but multiple companies. When Northern Trust processes checks they include all checks paid the same day to the same address in the same envelope regardless of which company it goes to. In previous cases, I would have a client send payment but the check would end up in the envelope of another company that received a separate check payment from an unrelated payee that day. I would never get the check. In this case, I received a check from a client and behind that check in the same envelope was a check from a different party to a different company in my shared office space. I would expect that this is not allowable for a number of reasons but especially because banking information from the checks is getting into the hands of a different party than who they were intended for. Northern Trust told me that that is just the way they do it. They said I could contact the bank that initiated the payment to change a setting but that was not possible."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/19, I received a letter from this debt collector about a bill that is not mine. My wife called the company and gave account number and name of the collection notice and representative for debt collector asked for my last 4 digits of my social and she refused ; stating that she had already verified by supplying account number and name. The representative stated he needed his social security number, he refused to look up account number. I do not owe this debt and believe it is fraud. I have no knowledge of this account nor never received any bills from this company."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony Bank sent me an email about my credit card saying, "" We noticed that after we sent you a new Sam 's Club Mastercard last year, you continued to use your old card. This new card replaces your old Sam 's Club Mastercard. The old card will be deactivated soon and you will no longer be able to make purchases on it. '' When I rec 'd a new card ( expires XX/XX/XXXX ) I cut up my old card. So I obviously wasn't using it, so this email immediately made me nervous, believing someone was using my account with the old expiration date/security code from rear of the card. 

I called Synchrony Bank, spent way too long getting past their automated answering system, which said they were experiencing long wait times. ( To me that means they either did something that caused a lot of their customers to call in or they are understaffed. 

When I finally got a real person ( who obviously did not speak XXXX as his native language ), repeated all the info I had already given the automated system ( Seems like the purpose of the system asking is to keep you distracted so you don't realize how long you have been waiting ) and told him the purpose of my call, he said no one was using my old card, Synchrony Bank had sent this email to ALL their credit card customers! 

I told him that was unacceptable to think it was ok to send a bogus email containg lies to customers that makes them think someone is using their credit card w/o authorization and I may as well be doing business with Wells Fargo. 

I asked for the name & contact info of the gov't agency overseeing banks & credit cards but he wouldn't. When I said it was the FTC & I would look it up, he suddenly "" remembered '' & gave me the phone number. 

Does the FTC allow banks to send such lying emails to credit card customers?"
Checking or savings account,"Ive opened a savings and a time deposit account with Chase bank around 3 years ago, as advised by the banker I open the savings account with minimum balance of {$300.00} that wont trigger any service fee. Couple months later I closed the time deposit account and keep the savings account without touching it for the last 3 years and today when I approach the branch to close my savings account and was told the balance remaining only {$190.00} due to monthly service charge of below minimum balance I was surprised I did not touch this account since opened with a minimum balance how came for charged? I was told theres a {$8.00} fee charge to my account one day which trigger the minimum balance lower, but that {$8.00} was refunded to my account a year later! But the balance still requires service fee. I asked since they refund the unauthorized charge of {$8.00} which meant my account should never falls below {$300.00} in the beginning they should refund all the service charge to me but they refuse the reason is because its too long ago. I totally felt I got fooled by a bank, how can I save money in an account resulted in losing money which I hardly conduct any withdrawal, no protection on consumer big bank like Chase make lots of money by eating on my savings. I was forced to close my account to avoid further loss with a remaining balance of {$190.00} only, lost 33 % but would strongly wish you can help me to get my money back. Today is XX/XX/2019"

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I was alerted through my credit monitoring programs that my credit score had dropped significantly. When I went to check on the reason I discovered that my {$3000.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX card limit had decreased by {$2300.00} making it only a {$700.00}. This in turn jumped my debt to limit ratio to 97 % ( I owe {$660.00} ) which caused my score to drop over 40pts. I  accessed my online account for the card and saw nothing indicating a change. I opened my statements and saw it was still showing {$3000.00}. When I contacted the card company they said that on XX/XX/2019 they changed the limit and then on XX/XX/XXXX, sent a letter. The claim was that they occasionally receive information from the credit bureaus and then make changes without notifying their customers based on that information. When they were asked to fix the problem, I was informed that I would have to go through a full credit limit increase application allowing them to pull and place an inquiry on my credit report which is now 40pts lower due to their changes so now I won't qualify.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am a victim of fraud
Credit card or prepaid card,"The problem with my account is that the bank has lowered my credit limit three times in the last seven months. 
When I opened my XXXX XXXX credit card through XXXX XXXX, I was agiven a {$250.00} credit limit which quickly increased to {$800.00}. XX/XX/XXXX the bank lowered my credit limit to {$750.00}. Again in XX/XX/XXXX the bank lowered my credit limit to {$700.00}. I have consistently paid on my account at least the minimum due so my account has always been in good standing. In XX/XX/XXXX I purposely made a large payment to bering my balance down below the 50 % mark of my credit limit in an effort to increase my credit score. Once again, shortly there after the bank lowered my credit limit to {$400.00}. 
The reasoning the bank is giving me is becasue there has been a significant decrease in my credit score. Well, ... 
Frist of all I bought a new vehicle at the end of XX/XX/XXXX and because of the financing and sending the app to banks, yes my credit score dropped. However, everytime this bank runs my credit they ding my credit score as well. Not to mention by continually lowering my credit limit you have now increased my credit/debt utilization which is lowering my credit score. So guess what, my credit score keeps going down or staying the same because of the negative impact this bank has had on it. My performance with this bank has been good. I have always paid on my credit card. I just don't understand how a bank/credit card can continually negatively impact your credit score in the way this bank has done so. I have looked and verified on my credit report that this has negatively impacted my credit rating. it's stating right on the report because of decrease in credit limit and increase in credit utilization you have been negatively impacted!"
Student loan,"Navient placed me into and Income Driven Repayment Plan ( IDR ) and kept me in an IDR payment plan without my consent or even an application. Also, according to my credit report, their website, and my account statements, there is a large disagreement on the outstanding balance which has the tendency to change by large amounts on any given month that are not consistent with my payments. Furthermore, the company is not putting any of my payment towards the principle of my unsubsidized loans, just interest. I was under the impression when I set up my auto-pay that I was entering into a standard repayment plan as I know that this is the most financially healthy option in the long run. The company is taking advantage of me and has placed me in a situation that is going to cost way more money. I have asked for a solution and explanations and I was told that someone would look over my account and I have heard nothing else. Why should I be expected to uphold my agreement, when Navient has not held theirs and has hurt me financially in the long run?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Now for the issue. For the last 6 months I have been aggressively working on my credit score in order to purchase a new car in XX/XX/2019. My credit score was 27 points from reaching XXXX. Then to my surprise I receive a notification that my credit score dropped 36 points. So first pull my credit report to see what in the world could be the change because I dont have any added debt and Ive been paying all my bills on time. The issue why my credit score dropped 36 points was because on XX/XX/2019 Navient reported to all three agencies that my student loan balance increased by {$3100.00} and then Navient on the same day reported that my student loan increased by {$2400.00} for a total of {$5600.00} in increase debt. So I call Navient and speak to Customer Representative # XXXX to see what was going on because I am not back in school and I havent taken any additional loans and the representative lets me know that I dont have any new student loans and there isnt an increase of {$5600.00} on my student loans there is only an increase of about {$300.00} and she doesnt know why Navient reported an additional {$5300.00} to the credit agencies. I have attached documentation reflecting the only change in my credit report. I also called all three agencies regarding the 36 point drop and each customer representative informed me that the change is due to an increase in my debt indicated by my student loan provider of {$5600.00}. I was also told that it could take months for my score to increase by the 36 points even if Navient fixes the mistake. 

Navient inaccurately report on my credit reports and why no one has caught this. The 36 point decrease has put me in a completely different credit score bracket with a completely different interest rate for the car I have been planning to purchase. This error affects me in the long run and my financial well being. I need a person to give me a call to resolve this. I would like a live person to give me a call and explain why {$5600.00} was reported to the credit agencies and what is being done to fix the situation."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","To Whom It May Concern, On XX/XX/XXXX I accepted an offer from Wells Fargo to be put on their "" Disaster Aid Relief Plan '' due to the fact I had been impacted by the two Hurricanes late summer. This plan required no payments while under the plan and also offered "" credit bureau reporting protection '' suppressing all credit reporting while under the plan. The plan consisted of an automatic initial 90 day period at when concluded would then convert to a loan modification to extend the payments that had accrued unpaid during this time frame to the end of the loan. The modification plan consists of me making three monthly payments beginning in XXXX and ending in XXXX at which point the loan would be permanently "" modified '' putting the past due payments to the end of the loan. 
Since XXXX when I accepted Wells Fargo 's offer to be put on this "" disaster relief plan '', I have on six different occasions been assured by my disaster relief reprsentative "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' XXXX that absolutely under no circumstances would any negative credit bureau reporting would take place as I repeatedly advised her that my credit was paramount and I most certainly did not want to be reported negatively to the credit bureaus. In fact she advised me "" NOT '' to make any payments during this process and "" NOT '' to worry about them reporting me past due to the credit bureaus assuring me with statements of "" Wells Fargo has your back '', "" We are there for you during this trying time '' "" what has happened to you is not your fault and that is why we have this plan to help you '' etc. etc. 
Additionally, I attempted to reach her on two occasion 's the past few months and I was referred to her Manager "" XXXX XXXX '' ( XXXX ) XXXX the manager over the department as she was out of the office. During the first conversation with Mr. XXXX he again stated and gave me the exact same assurance as Ms. XXXX had and since I was under their "" disaster relief modification program '' and not under a "" regular modification program '' absolutely no negative credit reporting would take place. 
The second conversation I had with Mr. XXXX consisted of him informing me that my "" disaster relief modification '' was approved and that my credit was "" protected until XX/XX/XXXX '' to allow for completion of my disaster relief modification. '' Again stating how they were going "" above and beyond '' to assist their customer 's during this trying time to take "" one less worry '' off of their customer 's worrying about their mortgage and to instead for me to focus on taking care of myself and my family during this "" trying time I was going through ''. 

On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I started receiving emailed credit alerts from all three credit bureaus advising me of a major delinquency suddenly being reported from Wells Fargo as over "" 120 days late ''. I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX and he apparently knew about the situation and was working to get it resolved. He advised that someone had incorrectly "" coded '' my loan incorrectly. He advised this should be a simple fix and should be corrected within a couple of days and would call me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX for an update. As understandably upset as I was, I mentioned to him if not, I would be taking action and filing complaints for immediate investigation.The following day Friday XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by "" XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo Executive Offices XXXX ext. XXXX '' to advise there had indeed been a mistake by them reporting me to the credit bureau as delinquent when in fact there should be "" NO '' credit reporting at all and the status on my report should be "" current paid as agreed '' as of XX/XX/XXXX as my loan was when I accepted and was put on their disaster relief plan on XXXX. She told me she was going to "" light a fire '' under the credit bureau reporting team and get back to me Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX as well to advise the correction had been done. When I arrived home from work that day I had a letter from Wells Fargo advising that my loan had been "" sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX '' and to contact them regarding my mortgage loan after XX/XX/XXXX. 
Tuesday afternoon came and after not hearing from XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, I reached out to both. I emailed XXXX XXXX and he called and left me a voice mail that "" the mistake was being corrected but had no date when it would be completed ''. I then reached out to XXXX XXXX. This time she was rude and advised me she was busy and had "" over 40 cases '' and had no updated information and would "" have to get back to me '' Friday XX/XX/XXXX. She went on to advise she was aware my loan was being transferred from Wells Fargo and if I had any questions to "" contact them '' after 3-1. 

I received no phone call from XXXX XXXX last Friday as promised and now she will not return my call. She had no sense of urgency or concern when I spoke to her about the situation last time we spoke. 
I feel that they are aware my loan is being transferred to another loan servicer in a matter of days and are not working to correct their mistake before this happens. 
I desperately need help in getting their mistake corrected as this is causing an enormous amount of stress for me as I am already XXXX with major health problems. I would so very much appreciate all that you can do to assist me and please feel free to contact me to provide more information if needed. 
I can be reached at XXXX or XXXX. My email address is XXXX. My loan # XXXX with Wells Fargo. 
This is the contact information for the Wells Fargo Personnel I have spoken and/or dealt with : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Disaster Relief Dept. Representative XXXX XXXX XXXX Disaster Relief Dept. Manager XXXX XXXX XXXX ext. XXXX Wells Fargo Executive Offices Thank you again for all of your help! 

Very Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX an autoloan with State Farm bank was obtained fraudulently on my name for the amount of {$24000.00} for a used car XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. VIN : XXXX. I came to realize about this loan because of an invoice of XXXX Toll service with a picture of this vehicle I never had - this invoice was I received at my address. The auto-loanthough, was obtained with a different address, a place I never lived in before. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to DMV and was able to obtain a Certified Title History of this vehicle. I realized then, this car was purchased on my name. I then called XXXX  credit Bureau to obtain a copy of my credit report. I confirmed this unpaid loan hurt my good credit history and created a fraud alert and requested a service for credit monitoring.I also filed a police report same day. I also disputed this loan and they confirmed it was deleted from my report. I also contacted State FarmBank and disputed this loan as well, I was in contact with an Investigator-State Farm Bank Financial Crimes, XXXX XXXX, phone XXXX. He sent me a Forgery Affidavit on  XX/XX/XXXX. I sent all documents requested including my Driver 's license and police report. I thought the problem was solved but then was told I had to file a dispute with all three credit bureaus and called XXXX  and XXXX  ; both came back with negative results about my dispute on the auto loan.

Mortgage,"I have been tryng to submit my Mortgage Assistance Packet to Freedom 3 times now. Each time submitted, I am sending via email and to two ( 2 ) fax numbers, all of which have been opened, per my read receipts.

Currently, I am in the hole with payments, and can blame really no one else but myself, as the don't care about my current situation. Per my previous complaint, I have stated that I can not afford the new monthly payment due to tax reassessment. However, no communication, nothing to show that they give a hoot. 
I am sending this complaint for several reasons : 1. To force someone to contact me via email, rather than postal mail, per my request in every note, email and fax I have sent them. Postal mail takes to long, and can be used to XXXX me out of deadlines. 
2. To create a paper trail, which is admissible in any court, showing that I am trying to get help to no avail from Freedom. 
3. I feel taken advantage of, as I am on a fixed income and can not make additional higher contributions to payment, at this time. 

Continued ignoring and lack of communication is a well known tactic, one that often results in a foreclosure. I will not have it, and that is why I am pushing the issue."

Checking or savings account,"I have had a checking and savings account for many years ( since they bought Washington Mutual ) with Chase Bank. My savings account was set up as a Basic Chase Savings account that required me to transfer {$25.00} per month to not charge fees for having the savings account. I just discovered they have been charging me {$20.00} per month since XX/XX/2017 when my savings account was changed to a type that required {$15000.00} daily balance. I escalated and spoke to three people there that all said they see no record of me changing the savings account type and they are not sure why that happened. 
They have now taken nearly {$1000.00} and have no record of me changing the account type. They changed back to Basic Chase Savings today and fees should stop but will not and can not refund anything over {$100.00} they said. 

So while they feel bad, they can not help me. Chase has done something under-handed here and I am guessing I am not the only XXXX. I do watch my checking but have been very busy and have not paid a lot of attention to the savings since I didn't expect any real change. And it can be a little confusing with the monthly transfer. I do not get paper statements. 

I feel they should refund the whole amount since they have no record of me changing the account type and they have practiced in a shady manner. 
The managers I spoke to were XXXX XXXX -very nice but could not help so transferred me to another manager XXXX XXXX . I believe they are in XXXX Ohio. ( Please remove names of Chase reps for publishing thought could be helpful for research is all ) thanks very much.

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Took out a installment loan which has, like most loans, a payoff amount which reduces the amount of interest that I pay out during the duration of the loan. For example, If I borrowed XXXX, @ 85 % interest my payment would be about XXXX. If I pay more than the XXXX, the extra funds go directly to the XXXX to reduce the loan amount minus the interest. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I took out an installment loan from Worth Finance, the business is located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Texas [ XXXX ] XXXX, I've been making all my payments on time. At times I've made bulk payments in the amounts of anywhere from {$300.00} to {$400.00}, figuring that the payments were bringing down the loan amount minus interest. Interest is added after the bulk payments has changed the loan amount. 
What Worth Finance has been doing, they've used the bulk payments as monthly payments, by doing that they have been collecting interest @ 86 % and never adding the bulk payments to reduce the loan amount. As you can see, if a customer pays out the loans early, they, Worth, losses interest. 
The contract that I signed makes no mention that they have the right to do that. If they would like to do such a thing I must be notified in writing, which I have not ever seen, much less received. It's in clear violation of the contract. When I approached the clerk, initials XXXX, I was told the computer does that they don't. Regardless it's not in the contract that such actions are being done with my or anyone else 's bulk payments.

Mortgage,"Our loan servicer was Guaranteed Rate ( GR ). We had missed over 90 days of payments and have been trying to set up a loan modification since XX/XX/XXXX  In XX/XX/XXXX we were approved for a trial plan, with payments being made XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. We completed the HAMP trial program. However, the only documentation we received from GR was receipt and application of the funds ( not to our outstanding mortgage however ). We found out in XX/XX/XXXX that a modification was approved on XX/XX/XXXX. But before documents were sent for final execution, our loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they had not received any documentation at all from Guaranteed Rate. About a month later, the original mortgage in default was transferred but no documentation at all related to the modification. I have repeatedly contacted GR ( and documented ) to request that modification information be sent to XXXX since XXXX. XXXX did not receive and to date has not received any information regarding the loan modification trial or approval we went through with GR. 
I have contacted GR on numerous occasions requesting that they send those documents, and they still have not sent those documents. Therefore we have been accruing additional interest and have not been able to get current on our mortgage. 
I wrote to GR on numerous occasions requesting they look into the matter. I received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and two weeks ago ( XX/XX/XXXX ) stating that they were researching the matter. However, there has been no further information. 
I also sent a letter detailing how they had failed to comply with C.F.R. 1024.35 describing the events above and in particular 1 ) Failure to forward relevant documentation and information related to a pending modification 2 ) Payment Errors : About a week later I received the same form letter, to that the matter was being researched. 
I spoke with a Guaranteed Rate representative on XX/XX/XXXX who informed me that the plan was approved and that this should have been sent to XXXX. The amount was {$4900.00} at 4.75 %. This is nowhere near our trial plan, which was {$4100.00}. Even our original mortgage was ~ {$4500.00} at 4 % which includes taxes, insurance and PMI. Since this was an FHA loan/HAMP, the payment/interest rate should not have been significantly higher than the trial plan. Regardless, none of this information was conveyed to XXXX. 

After we had completed the HAMP trial program, but before documents were sent for final execution, our loan was transferred to XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Plan was approved XX/XX/XXXX and transferred on XX/XX/XXXX. We reached out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they had not received any documentation at all from Guaranteed Rate. About a month later, the original late mortgage was transferred and no documentation at all related to the modification. I have repeatedly contacted GR ( and documented ) to request that modification information be sent to XXXX. As of today, XXXX XXXX at GR, via a representative informed me that documents were in preparation for modification ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when loan was transferred ( XX/XX/XXXX ).

Debt collection,"Let me first say that I spoke with The collection agency, and I was very displeased with the outcome of what was discussed. 
It is truly very unethical to continue to pursue an amount after the information I have and I feel I should have not been Liable for the amount of {$120.00}. 
Collection Company : AmSher WebSite : https : //www.amsher.com Debt Collector : XXXX Outcome : Pay {$95.00} in 1 month No real details were ever provided to me about how the charges on my credit report ended up becoming a debt collection. ( Very unprofessional in my opinion ) I never received any formal notice about this debt from the bank. 
Without giving my personal information I will explain what I told the collection agency. I became aware of the negative mark against my credit report for the first time on XX/XX/2019 and I contacted the collection agency AmSher. 
This is my first mark on my credit report. I have a 0 Fico score. I was told that the debt originated from XXXX. I was told that my Ssn and my name where used to create an account on XXXX, I asked for details of this and was informed of an Address tied to the account, at first the address did not register to me during the first call so I stated it was not associated with me. Also I was told to go ahead and contact the financial institution where the claim originated to see if by chance the amount could be striken and cleared before the collection process began. She is a debt collector working for a collections agency, why would she suggest this false option knowing that once a bank closes an account it is then left up to her agency to obtain a resolution. Again I would like to point out that ( no details of any real information was provided except an address of an XXXX XXXX XXXX ) located in XXXX county GA, my Ssn and my name. The address was that of a XXXX  in which I was previously XXXX  at for a long period of time. I These are important details that I need for my records. This is a claim from 4 Years ago. There needs to be some sort of detailed information report provided to me so I can substantiate this claim for myself. My credit status is very important to me regarding this. 
I proceeded to call the bank. I was told that since the account was closed nothing could be done on their end but that the collection should be nulled by providing the circumstances I told the bank. I asked for information from the bank and nothing was provided. I call AmSher back and got back in touch with representative XXXX to continue the collection. I informed her that the reason I was unable to pay the balance was due to me being XXXX  for at least a period of 6 months with no form of assistance. The same year I suffered a very hard loss in my family. My mother XXXX   from XXXX one month prior to my XXXX. I informed XXXX that I had no means to pay. I was in XXXX, I was young and I did not understand the importance of a negative balance and how it could affect me in the future. These are details I shared with her because I felt that she wanted to help me by avoiding a payment. After I was finished talking She informed me the best she could do was to lower the {$120.00} down to {$95.00} but I was only going to be given one month to provide the money. I felt I could not argue any further and accepted the offer. She gave me her information, Told me that when I had the payment ready I could contact her to settle this. I was only being allowed one month. The conversation ended. 

My complaint : I was over charged for a good or service or I over drafted my account is what happened to my best knowledge. ( No information for me to confirm ) so I really don't know. 
I was in a XXXX XXXX and did not have assitance. I had no means of contacting my bank. No means to inform them of my situation. The very least I expected was to have most if not all of the amount due stricken because circumstance in this situation matters. If I was aware and able the amount would have never been able to reach that high. This is completely my fault I was the one who committed a crime and XXXX. For your company to seek payment for almost 4 years. This is a shame and in the worst way wrong. The reason I am taking this action is because I feel I have been taken advantage of and treated unfairly by the collection agency. If I had been informed of this and able to reach out to the bank, I would have told them the circumstances and I'm almost certain XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   would have not persued this.

Checking or savings account,"In late XX/XX/XXXX I got a letter in the mail to open account with them and get {$200.00} if I do a direct deposit and maintain a minimum balance. I had my check going into 2 banks already I added them in for {$200.00} to start with. It takes two 14day cycles to see your action. I month and a half I tried to log in and I could not because of the demands they ask to you put this and that before they will talk to you. With difficulty to get to talk to them or been able to log in. I was very much discouraged to make contact. Bank location was 10-15 miles from my home. I let it go since this account was meant to save only. I never withdrew any thing during its life. 

Some how I got into the account 2 months later and checked that the deposit was in. I increased to $ 1000+ a check. Then I left it alone till now when it has 32000 in it. When looked at it after that long they have charged me {$50.00} times 2 for low balance as maintenance fee when i did not have any activity in my account.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My husband and i purchased a home in XX/XX/XXXX. Our mortgage was sold to Wells Fargo and the 1st payment was due in XX/XX/XXXX. We set the payment up on Wellsfargo online and figured all was ok. I received a call 3 months later stating that we are 3 months behind on our mortgage and owe a balance of over XXXX. I immediately paid this over the phone and asked why the online payments never came out and why is this the first i'm hearing of this?. The representative said we never set it up. NOT true. I never received a call, email, letter, nothing trying to retrieve the payment until the call i got 3 months later! if you look at our credit, in the 54 years of us being married, never have we ever ever missed 1 mortgage payment. ever and we can not get them to reverse it so now our credit is showing 3 late payments and this is hurting our credit. i want to lodge a complaint to all 3 credit bureaus and  WELLS Fargo. This is very unfair to us. we are senior citizens and do not deserve to be penalized for their error. Please try to help us and go after Wells Fargo to correct this."

Not aware for what this collection was I immediately disputed with the 3 bureaus as well as with the Midland Credit Management company. As outlined under the The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act I requested a Validation of debts to include a statement and/or signed contract. In response, I received notice that the debt had been validated as accurate from the bureaus and an offer for settlement from Midland. They ignored my request to substantiate their reporting. The FTC states on their website that with such request the collector has to send you written verification of the debt, like a copy of a bill for the amount you owe, before it can start trying to collect the debt again. https : //XXXX.XXXX.XXXX.XXXX/XXXX/XXXX-XXXX-XXXX, yet all I have received is numerous offers to settle an erroneous debt while they continued to report this derogatory tradeline. 

It's evident Midland is not able to substantiate their derogatory report in association with my name. However I am open to giving them one last attempt to physically substantiate the erroneous reporting or promptly delete such reporting information as the FCRA and FTC instructs. The reported inaccuracies are damaging and impedes my rightful ability to gain financing with fair and responsible terms.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX, from USAA stating a change in my credit card term. For the second time in 2 years, USAA lowered my available credit limit dramatically based on what they said was delinquencies on my credit report. Each time, USAA lowered the credit limit to right above what I owed on the line. This made it look like I had maxed out a line of credit, which I had not. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called USAA and spoke with a person named XXXX in their Executive Resolution area. He proceeded to literally argue with me and tell me theres nothing that can be done. After a brief conversation, it became apparent XXXX knew nothing about how credit works and was just there to stonewall me. I pulled my XXXX credit report immediately after this phone call and it showed absolutely no delinquencies. That same evening, I called back to USAA and spoke to an ER rep named XXXX. She said theres nothing that could be done and that they did not have any procedures to assist me any further. Again, another stonewall from USAA. XXXX, however, said I was using complaint language and completed a complaint form. XXXX did not offer to complete a complaint form on the initial call to USAA. Trust me, I was using complaint language on that call as well. I sent USAA a direct message via XXXX and received communication from a person named XXXX XXXX who would investigate further into my situation with USAA. I finally spoke to XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX. She said that lowering my credit limit was a business decision but never referenced the delinquencies claim about my credit on which USAA originally claimed to have based their decision. In my opinion, USAA can not back up their decision to lower my credit limit and are acting in deception. It was in XX/XX/XXXX in which I canceled my insurance with USAA. Ive had this credit card for over 19 years. I did not start having an issue with USAA with this credit card until I canceled my insurance with them. Not one time."

Mortgage,"I was in the process of refinancing and was asked by the lenders to provide pay-off documents. I was further informed that once pay-off documents had been received, I would not have to make the next two ( 2 ) mortgage payments or words to that effect. Later it was revealed that that was in correct and that I had to make XXXX 2016 mortgage payment. Partial payments were made after due date. FREEDOM Mortgage had reported to credit bureaus that account was 30 days late. This was no fault of mine for I was led to believe that I would not have to make XXXX 2016 payment, but proceeded to make payments. Based on this situation FREEDOM Mortgage emailed me stating that they asked the credit bureaus to remove this comment. As of XXXX XXXX, 2016, credit bureaus reports account as 30 days late. Received banking statement showing that one payment was received on XXXX XXXX, 2016, but not cashed until XXXX XXXX. Investigation revealed that the other payment ( {$700.00} ) still had not been cashed. Bank recommended to stop payment on {$700.00} and to contact FREEDOM Mortgage over the phone and make payment. This caused further delay in processing XX/XX/XXXX payment and I am being penalized. Lenders will not proceed with refinancing until this 30 days late is removed."

The next statement I received was for closing date XX/XX/XXXX. This statement showed no part of the {$600.00} on XX/XX/XXXX allocated to the promotional balance on XX/XX/XXXX, and a {$65.00} interest charge had been levied against the balance expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the customer service number and explained the steps outlined above, and the representative told me that while he understood, the only way I could avert the interest charges was to pay {$300.00} at that instant we were talking. 
I have arranged for the entire balance to be paid as of XX/XX/XXXX, but I refused to pay another {$300.00} on top of the {$600.00} that I paid on the XXXX of XXXX. Synchrony Bank or Amazon owes me {$65.00} that I was wrongfully charged in interest.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/2018, I closed an American Express Account. I had been dealing with several issues of identity theft, related to my ex-husband 's theft of my credit cards and personal information. The bills for this card were not going to my address as a result of this. When I was alerted to the debt, I attempted to get the debt consolidated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization I had been working with to pay off the debts accrued by my ex husband, in an effort to repair my credit. American Express made it very difficult to consolidate under this program, even though I was able to do this easily with my bank, which had recommended the program as a legitimate non-profit debt consolidation ( not forgiveness ) program. 

I spoke to an Amex representative and explained the situation to the individual on the phone, stating that I would pay off the debt in full, but that I wanted adverse information about the debt off my credit report, as I had not acquired the debt, nor had I received any indication the debt had been accrued, since the bills were not sent to my address. 

I agreed to a lump sum payoff under the understanding that this adverse information would be removed from my credit report. The cost was substantial to me, around {$10000.00}, but it was worth the price of fixing my credit and moving on from the debts accrued in my name. I was under the impression the individual I spoke with on the phone agreed to these terms. However, several months later, the adverse information is still on my credit report and, in fact, until last month, American Express was still reflecting that I had not paid the debt, though I had done so more than a year earlier. 

I am very distressed by this situation, as the identity theft has severely impacted my XXXXredit score and made it nearly impossible to move on from my divorce and find a new home for myself and my children. I would like this issue resolved, and for further advice on how to remove other negative items on my report that have been the result of identity theft."
Credit card or prepaid card,"After over 9 months of trying to locate a way to view my bill for my Synchrony Bank issued XXXX XXXX, I have had no success. I have talked to over 7 different representatives who claimed they would fix this, which was never resolved. The company sends emails and texts saying that it will allow you to link the card to your XXXX account, however after 6 months of research I discovered that XXXX actually has NO association with this card or bank, and the card can not be added. Each time I made a complaint they resend the same text messages and emails which provided ZERO results. I have been lied to, lead on, and am having to pay a credit card bill which I have NOT ONCE seen an actual bill for. I had ordered a product many months ago which I never received, I was unable to provide a receipt for this purchase due to the fraudulent company and therefore had to forfeit the product which I paid for. This is absolutely ridiculous and after nearly a year I don't know where else to turn."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The problem is that all four credit bureaus use the same phone number XXXX XXXX ) and web site XXXX XXXX XXXX to offer options to people who want to opt out of prescreened offers. When I tried to opt out of future advertisement, the automated system kept getting my address wrong. No matter how I repeated my address, it kept miss-repeating my Street address. This kept me from being able to complete the over-the-phone form. This is not an isolated incident, it has happened to me before, two other times over the last few months. This is obviously being done on purpose to eliminate or reduce the number of people who opt out of prescreened offers through the mail. I tried to resolve this problem by contacting the FTC but couldn't fill out the online form because of the multi business and address parties involved. The automated system kept giving me error messages and when I tried to resolve the problem through their chat system, they couldn't help me at all."

SInce at least XX/XX/XXXX, a charge for a cash advance has appeared on my bill for {$550.00}. I never used a cash advance, in fact, the cash advance feature was never a part of my card features. The cash advance balance has grown to {$1100.00} to date. A rate of about 16.00 a month since the charge was first placed on my account, so a total of about {$1500.00} in interest since XX/XX/XXXX. 
This year, I really took note and took action. 
I repeatedly called Macy 's XXXX XXXX   customer service at XXXX. One agent confirmed I never had a cash advance feature, the other agents were of no help, I was on hold for 30-45 minutes, transferred and hung up on repeatedly trying to resolve my issue. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I put in a dispute for the whole amount of {$1100.00} and Macy 's XXXX  claims to be investigating. I am XXXX   years old, I have XXXX XXXX and have to deal with this issue in between my XXXX treatments. I feel Macy 's is predatory and has not been a help.

Debt collection,"I received a letter from Phoenix Financial Services stating that I owe a creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$2800.00}. I have never had any sort of involvement with this company ever. Upon looking both of these companies on the website, I discovered that these were both scams. They have hurt my credit while I was building it up. I don't understand how anyone can just open these fraudulent accounts and hurt someone's credit like this. Something needs to be done to hold companies like this accountable with fines and prison time. This is just wrong and I feel bad for people who don't know their rights or how to handle situations like this."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Paypal Credit account went past due in or around XXXX or XXXX of this year. After receiving multiple calls. I received a message that my account would be sent to collections. I do not know if this was an in-house collections or if it was sent to another company, I didn't keep track because I assumed they would honor their agreements. I returned the call where I was offered a payment agreement that stated in exchange for me scheduling my next three payments of {$270.00} with them over the phone I would be allowed to continue use of my account during the three months the payments were made even if my account showed past due, I would no longer receive collections calls, my account would not be reported to as past due to credit bureaus and my account would be reset/re-aged at the end of the three payments. The first two payments completed successfully and I was able to continue use of my account during those two months. Sometime after the second payment I started receiving collections calls again, roughly about XXXX of this year. I returned their call at XXXX and explained that I had a payment agreement and was told that servicing of Paypal Credit changed companies and that they didn't have all payment agreement information, they were investigating due to multiple calls, and that they would honor the previous agreement and my account would be re-aged 48 hours after my last scheduled payment in the agreement. Soon after my payment posted but the account was never re-aged. I called again and was told they misspoke, the department that does that is not open on the weekends and it would be reset after 48 business hours. I called again after this period of time and was told again they must have misspoke, I needed to call a second number because they set up the agreement. I called that number twice and both times I was transferred 2 to 3 times before finally being transferred to a number where I received a recording that stated this number was no longer in service. I called XXXX again and was told that they would set up a complaint for investigation. I finally called back today and was told my payment agreement never existed and they will not be re-aging my account. I would like to point out that now my account shows three months past due rather than the original one or two and my account is still in past due status. Exactly why would I set up a payment agreement that despite making payments every month allowed my account to fall further past due than it originally was? Now they want me to pay an over {$800.00} minimum payment to bring my account current which should not be the case, I can not afford, and if I could afford it my account would have never went into a past due status to begin with and they are now refusing to assist. Additionally, I believe that the original collections call, either in - house or with a different company, may have even recorded the conversation with me."

At the time I did not realize that I had two bank account profiles one being my joint and the other which I always use. The payment went to the joint instead of the correct account and I noticed this because the payment was still in my account so once I recognized this I logged on to NJClass and deleted the incorrect bank profile and resubmitted to the correct account. I noticed the money was still in my account so I logged on again and saw that my payment privileges have been revoked. So I called to try to pay and was told I cant make a payment over the phone and would have to appeal to have my payment options reinstated. I emailed them and havent gotten a response back.

I initiated a dispute with Discover about the transaction around XX/XX/XXXX. The case number for that dispute being XXXX. 

I was given a credit for the amount in dispute, but found out this was reversed on XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I was informed XXXX had provided sufficient evidence. This was a scan containing the gift card numbers they supplied me. 

I tried reasoning, saying why would I need to pay for the same flight if the gift cards were valid? I stated they ( Discover ) would see another transaction, this time from XXXX themselves, for the flight, as a charge. And I did have to charge the flight, the purchase occurring on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, at the terminal. I also uploaded this itinerary, showing the same flight number, dates, passengers, destination, etc as matching the original made on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was informed by someone at Discover, perhaps XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( I spoke with so many people at so many different times trying to get this resolved the exact date eludes me ) that if I could get it in writing from XXXX that the gift cards were fraudulent, that would really help my cause. 

I submitted in writing that request to XXXX XXXX on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a response until Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, and it was vague at best, stating the reservation had been canceled due to a dispute that was filed against the purchase. 

This was not sufficient for Discover. 

I then got it in writing, from XXXX after filing a XXXX complaint against XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, stating the following : "" ... in reviewing our records, I found that the XXXX gift cards ( listed below ) that you mentioned acquiring from XXXX were purchased through unauthorized activity. 
XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} Once this was brought to our attention, all reservations associated with the gift cards were canceled, and the money was returned to the credit cards used to purchase these cards from XXXX XXXX initially. We regret that this resulted in the cancellation of your, XXXX, and XXXX reservation. Although I was glad to see we honored the original fare, were sorry for your disappointment with having to rebook and pay for your familys reservation upon arrival to the airport. 

Please keep in mind that XXXX XXXX is not responsible for honoring invalid gift cards or refunding any additional funds applied to the reservation. With that in mind, the funds applied from the two additional XXXX gift cards ( listed below ) arent available for use or eligible for a refund. 
XXXX | {$200.00} XXXX | {$200.00} I called Discover on XX/XX/XXXX, telling them of the new information. 

The lady with whom I spoke, XXXX ( sp? ), stated that the case is closed, and they ( Discover ) would not take it up any further. 

I stated that this is new information and that my dispute center on discover.com states ( EMPHASIS MINE ) We have finished our second review of this investigation. Based on information we received from both you and the merchant, the transaction appears to be valid. We sent you a letter via mail or secure message at Discover.com about this investigation which includes a copy of documentation we reviewed. Please review this information and notify us immediately if you wish to continue this dispute. IF YOU HAVE NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED, WE WILL BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON YOUR BEHALF. 

I asked how Discover could possibly side with XXXX when they ( Discover ) have it in black and white that I was sold a bill of goods. 

The answer to this, and every other question I asked of them, was that the case is closed and they ( Discover ) would not take it up any further. And that I should try to resolve this with XXXX. That Discover is ( paraphrasing ) done with the matter unless they get it in writing from XXXX that a refund is owed to me. 

I have emailed XXXX, and have not heard back. And the odds of hearing back are ... not ideal."

Debt collection,"XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received a letter from ARA, Inc stating I owed their debt collection agency more than {$12000.00} for an old debt from XXXX XXXX. I have a few accounts with XXXX XXXX that are all current, so I called XXXX XXXX to investigate as this is the first notice from any debt collector regarding this. XXXX XXXX advised me that the account listed on the notice was not a valid account with them. I had XXXX XXXX also check my social to see if there were any old accounts for me, which there are/were none. I spoke to several people within XXXX XXXX 's idenitity theft and fraud units. 
I called ARA, Inc at XXXX the next day and inititally spoke to XXXX XXXX. I explained that I believed they had some bad info on me as XXXX XXXX had no record of this debt. Also, that my credit was not very good back in XXXX and that none of the credit cards that I had at that time, gave me more than {$1500.00} credit. XXXX XXXX told me that the last digit on my XXXX XXXX account number on the notice from them was incorrect. XXXX XXXX placed me on a brief hold to 'verify this info ', and another woman XXXX XXXX picked up. I explained all of this to XXXX XXXX like I did to XXXX and XXXX XXXX told me that the original creditor was really XXXX Bank and that the credit card was mailed in XXXX to an old residence that I did not live at in XXXX. She said that the inflated debt was due to late fees, interest, and penalties, and she stated my SS # to me and that the debt was valid and then started yelling at me. She yelled at me that they would sue me in XXXX XXXX which I lived and then hung up on me. 
I spoke to the Fraud Unit at XXXX XXXX who put me in contact with XXXX to show that some Fraud activity on my credit may appear. I made a report with XXXX and I filed a complaint with the CFPB, my next step will be to contact my XXXX and the XXXX. I am sending ARA, Inc the sample letter on this website inquiring for more information from them regarding this debt. I mailed this letter today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX."

I was told I needed to send {$500.00} by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX or there would be a warrant placed for my arrest. I had not received any communication by mail prior to this phone call nor did I receive any other phone calls prior except for a phone call that was placed to me on XX/XX/XXXX which I thought was fraudulent. I also received a call coming from my county courthouse and was told I would need to contact this creditor or I could have a felony charge on my background.
Mortgage,"Wells Fargo appears to have fraudulently manufactured my mothers loan Documents after the merger date of XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX. Page 1 at the bottom shows the date of XX/XX/XXXX, but the number 8 appears to be altered, with page 6 of the loan documents it's showing a date of XX/XX/XXXX at the bottom of the page and also the notary seal has been whited out. There's also a mark that appears to look like a period symbol on my mother 's living trust signature which was done inadvertently by her possibly touching the pinhead on the paper and leaving an ink mark, I believe the Wells Fargo note that was provided to me by Wells Fargo has that mark slightly higher and I have numerous signatures of my mother on various documents and checks none of them having that mark near the C, which leads me to believe the signature was traced from the living trust I provided Wells Fargo.Also, on XX/XX/XXXX.

( emphasis added ) I respectfully request that you provide me with the following : 1. the amount of the debt ; 2. the name of the creditor to whom the debt is owed ; 3. verification or copy of any judgment ( if applicable ) ; 4. proof that you are licensed to collect debts in Maine ; 5. proof of the  last payment made on the account. 
I am asserting my rights under the federal and state Fair Debt Collection Practices Acts and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including these rights : Because I have disputed this debt in writing within 30 days of receipt of your initial notice, you must obtain verification of the debt or a copy of the judgment against me and mail these items to me at your expense. 
You can not add interest or fees except those allowed by the original contract or state law. 
Any attempt to collect this debt without validating it violates the FDCPA. 
Also be advised that I am keeping accurate records of all correspondence from you and your company, including recording all phone calls, and I will not hesitate to report violations of the law to my State Attorney General, the Federal Trade Commission and the XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Accordingly, if you have already reported this debt to any credit-reporting agency ( CRA ) or Credit Bureau ( CB ), then you must immediately inform them of my dispute with this debt.

Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate or failing to report information correctly violates the Fair Credit Reporting Act 1681s-2.

Student loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted paperwork to XXXX XXXX to see if my current student loans applied for the PSLF program. I had been working full time as an employee for XXXX  XXXX XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a rejection letter from XXXX XXXX stating that my current loans were not eligible for the PSLF program. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX and asked what I needed to do to have my loans qualify for the PSLF program. The customer service representative at that time said I needed to consolidate my current loans with my current lender at the time ( XXXX  ) in order to have them qualify for the PSLF program through XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I then called my current lender at the time and started the process of consolidating my Direct Stafford loans and they were officially consolidated on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I then reapplied for the PSLF program and was accepted. My loans were officially transferred to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
At this time I had already been working for a XXXX job for six years and had been in repayment status for my student loans. All those qualifying payments over those six years should have been applied to my PSLF repayment schedule. 
I then received an email in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX stating that I could view the amount of qualifying payments that were applied to my PSLF over the course of the last year. When I went to check I expected to see an accumulation of 7 years of payments, but there were only the payments I had made since my loans had officially transferred to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX.

I then called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to see why there were not more payments applied to my running balance for the PSLF and I was informed by a customer representative from XXXX XXXX that when I consolidated my loans prior to transferring them to XXXX XXXX that it null and voided any previous payments I had made on those loans. 
I was extremely upset, because the only reason I applied for the PSLF program is because I knew I had 6 years of payments that would set me up well to have my loans paid off in the 10 years or 120 payments whichever came first. If I would of known that consolidating my loans would null all those qualifying payments I WOULD OF NEVER DONE THAT. No one from XXXX  educated me on this crucial point. 
I then spoke to another representative from XXXX XXXX on that same day because I could not wrap my head around why I was told to consolidate when this would start me completely over on my repayment. I was then told directly from the customer service representative on XX/XX/XXXX that I was misinformed from XXXX XXXX and wrongly sent a denial letter that stated my loans were not eligible when in fact my Direct Stafford loans were eligible for the program and they did not need to be consolidated prior to transferring. 
I am seeking to have this fixed and to have my payments that I made over those six years prior to being told I had to consolidate applied to my running balance of my payments for my PSLF. 
This whole situation makes XXXX XXXX look extremely devious and further enforces the stigma around the PSLF program and why people are so frustrated with the process. 
I have attached official documents from XXXX, showing my loans prior to consolidation and documents showing the consolidation process and the denial letter from XXXX XXXX."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My credit reports state I have a Serious Delinquency on my Chase Mortgage. Chase is reporting that was 120 days late and that is incorrect. I was in a disaster area ( Hurricane Harvey XX/XX/XXXX ) and on a mortgage forbearance program sponsored by Chase From XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX - no mortgage payments were required. In XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a loan modification program where I made trial payments from XXXX through XXXX. My loan was modified and I started making payments according to the new schedule. At no time was I considered late. In XXXX of XXXX, my credit report was impacted by Chase reporting that I had a late payment history with the worst payment being over 120 day late. I disputed this with the credit reporting agencies several times. I called Chase in XXXX and they said that although no payments were required during the forbearance period, none were received (???? ). Basically saying that even though you weren't required to make a payment, you are technically late because a payment was not received. I received a letter from Chase in XX/XX/XXXX stating that my account has been reported correctly to the agencies. After continued disputes I called Chase in XXXX and spoke with the Credit Reporting Department. They agreed with me that I should not have been marked late and that the reporting was done in error. However, they have not guaranteed that this will be corrected. 
This false and inaccurate reporting has had a serious impacted the credit scores for my wife and I for over a year ; dropping our scores below 600 and denying us access to loans and competitive interest rates."

The aforementioned institution has placed me on restriction from using its products due to fraudulent activity in XX/XX/XXXX and has reported this restriction to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, This has essentially placed my personal financial activity on hold with my other banking institutions and jeopardizes the closing of those accounts and the in ability to open another account/product with existing institutions or new ones. In this request, I sent copies of the transactions in question as well as all of my personal identification information, all of which proves that I not only did not initiate the transaction as the "" Fraud Activity '' claim would infer, as I was a victim of a client who gave me 2 checks that I had no prior knowledge were drafted on a closed account.

Debt collection,"To the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : I XXXX XXXX, now files a complaint against a collection agency that has acquired information pertaining to a business that has been closed for well over seven ( 7 ) years. The XXXX of XXXX realizes that there are mandates for the collection of state fees for corporations to remain in good standing. These fees, once unpaid for one ( 1 ) year automatically dissolve a corporation or limited liability company originally accepted by the XXXX. In the attached letter, a collection agency is very cutely trying to show that they are trying to collect a monthly withholding tax, which is ludicrous enough. The Federal Trade Commission realized that trying to maintain a reasonable collection system in the country is impossible without legislative measures from Congress, an act that has been voided since Congress is moved only by lobbyist from various banking concerns and the thousands of collection agencies nationwide that can not be regulated. However, this collection by an entity known as The Allen Daniel Associates , Inc. is so corrupt and a threat against me personally or my driver 's license, that this agency should be permanently barred from acquiring information from the XXXX Department of Revenue. It may be possible that the XXXX has no idea that such a collection activity even exists, or that this state agency in in collusion with a collection practice that steps far beyond Fair Debt Collection Practices Act guidelines. One thing is certain, the corporation has been closed for far more than one year, and that there was never a withholding tax instituted by the XXXX of XXXX. I demand that all demands for payment cease and desist by this small-time collection agency known as The Allen Daniel Associates , Inc., and that this information from the XXXX of XXXX Department of Revenue be purged permanently. There is legal precedent on my side, and this threat by a collection agency on fictitious numbers and on claims that can no longer be legally enforced is a disgrace to the measures enforced by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - 2009 ) I demand that this collection agency be sanctioned by the CFPB and that the XXXX of XXXX be warned that these threats of illegal collection actions be shut down immediately. I will follow up with a complaint to the XXXX, both in the XXXX of XXXX XXXX as well as the state of XXXX if I do not have all collection actions permanently closed out within ten ( 10 ) business days."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On Friday, XX/XX/2018, my husband and I visited the XXXX XXXX XXXX  store in XXXX, FL. Upon our arrival, we were greeted by a salesman by the name of XXXX. We explained to XXXX that we were interested in viewing their XXXX home but was NOT looking to purchase until XX/XX/2018 because we were working on paying down our credit card balances. After viewing the home, XXXX was adamant that we should allow him to do a soft internal pull of our credit score so that he could show us the accounts that we should focus on paying down. We agreed under the conditions that it was a soft, internal pull that would NOT affect our credit. To our surprise, it not only resulted in a hard pull but our information was also sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  without our consent. As illustrated by the email communications, I was unsuccessfully in resolving this issue as well as explaining my concerns to the Owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. I was trying to get him to see that the information that XXXX communicated to us was clearly misleading and dishonest because otherwise, I wouldnt be upset if I came there with the intentions to buy. However, I was only looking and obtaining information to better prepare for my home-buying experience in the months to come. Please note that I never contacted XXXX XXXX to obtain any information regarding the status of the loan application-that information remains unknown."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am a victim of identity theft and I have submitted a notarized affidavit which serves as a legal document to my identity theft. I am also a victim of the XXXX breach and opted out of the settlement because I have suffered extreme losses due to the breach and the identity theft. I need the fraud accounts that are in my letter that is attached removed permanently from my file as I have also contacted the creditors as well. This is extreme in violation of my fair credit reporting act rights and I will seek legal recourse. I have also attached the printout of me being affected by the XXXX breach as well.
Credit card,"I have/had a Gap credit card since XX/XX/XXXX, which I have paid on time until recently, when I had a family emergency for which I had to leave the country for an extended period of time. As a result, I fell behind on my card payments for XXXX and XXXX. The outstanding balance at the time was {$140.00} of the {$300.00} credit limit ; then the outstanding balance went up to {$410.00}. About a week ago I went online to pay and bring my account current and thought everything was fine until recently, through credit monitoring, I found out that the company closed the account unknowing to me. As a result of this my credit score was seriously impacted. I called the company today XX/XX/XXXX to get a copy of their written policy/cc agreement showing how/when they go about closing an account, and was told they do not have a written policy, but review the account after 60 days and them make a decision. 
I am a XXXX year old trying to work and continue my education at the same time. I consider myself to be financially responsible. I had no idea that the card would be closed without any prior notice. I am now placed in a predicament because I need get a car to get to and from school and work and my credit score went so low that I will get excessively high interest rates, an may no longer be able to afford a payment for a reliable car. In addition, I am not sure how that will affect my ability to get a student loan. Not to mention if I do get a car I will also have to get insurance which will be higher because of my now very low credit score. 
Before this incident I had a XXXX score of almost XXXX now it 's down in the XXXX 's. I do not understand how I could have been penalized so drastically for XXXX credit card with a {$300.00} credit limit. I am being treated like I had a bankruptcy or foreclosure. This is not fair I have a good payment history with my other cards. What basis did they use to make the decision to close the card without prior notice? Did they review my credit? 
I was hoping the XXXX XXXX would work with me to re-age/restore the account so that I can get my credit score back up. They did not help. I am willing to pay down the balance to {$0.00} if that 's what it takes to get my credit fixed. Please can you help me?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have filed several disputes on what I believe to be inaccurate information on my Equifax credit report. I can't get into the Equifax dispute system because they are constantly having problems with their website. I only have one of the dispute results readily available. 
There is a derogatory remark on my credit file for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX for a collection of {$70.00}. I called XXXX XXXX for a copy of a bill as I have never received one. They tell me that they can't get a copy because it has been turned over for collection and I need to call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I call XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  to see if they can help me figure out what this is for. I get NO HELP from them. I am not going to pay something if I can't get a copy of a bill for it. 
This was on both on XXXX AND EQUIFAX. I file a dispute with both. XXXX cleared it off of my credit report."
Debt collection,"I was given a post card indicating that I was to pay an alleged traffic offense debt to XXXX Municipal Court back in XX/XX/2018. The post card is not marked, nor stamped by the post office, so I assumed it was another junk mail advertisement, til I turned it over. This was the first in a series of multiple attempts to collect a debt of {$330.00} for failure to control speed. I was never ticketed nor summoned by XXXX Municipal Court. I wrote a letter in response to McCreary, Velseka and Bragg and Allen PC on XX/XX/XXXX2018. They received my letter on XX/XX/XXXX2018. In my correspondence, I demanded they produce the original signature I gave indicating my contract with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and until that original binding contract was submitted for review, all written and telephone communication must cease until said documentation was submitted as valid proof of claim. I was never ticketed nor summoned by XXXX Municipal Court for any or such charges. On XX/XX/XXXX, McCreary and Velsek, Bragg and Allen PC called XXXX Municipal court and had the court contact my personal cell phone number, 1. they violated the original contract submission. They tried to get me to come into the court to produce a signature. I explained without valid proof, I would not be coming to court without an original summons with my signature agreeing to appear. The firm McCreary, Velseka and Bragg and Allen PC continuously send me letters unmarked by postage and post cards threatening my arrest. I tried to call their phone number. I'm left on hold, sent to a voicemailbox that is full and can't accept messages. The court has violated my rights by sending my information without my knowledge or consent to a third party."

It was denied since Chase did follow MLA at the time. I paid for the annual fee for the first time. In XX/XX/XXXX, Chase approved a new policy stating that all new account holders would get MLA applied. I tried getting it applied but since my account was too old, I did not get it. I was told to close my account and retry in XX/XX/XXXX when I could apply for a new account and get the benefit applied ( I also paid for the second annual fee ). In XX/XX/XXXX, I product shifted my old account and applied for a new account. It was denied since Chase changed the rules. Now I have to wait for 4 years to get a new account. I talked with the military chase representatives and application representatives, but they said they could not do anything. So I switched my account back since that was all they could do for me. So I had to pay a XXXX annual fee for the 3rd time since they keep changing the rules. I feel like they are changing them to avoid waiving my fee. With MLA, I should not have been charged the annual fee for the second and third time. This totals XXXX dollars and I will probably have to pay the fee again in XXXX for the fourth time ( XXXX per year )."

I called the office, and informed the lady who answered the phone that I had no knowledge of this debt, and that I had every intention of disputing the debt. I also informed them I was never notified of the debt or my rights to dispute whatsoever. The lady told me that the debt was now over {$1800.00} and that it would take longer to get the information to prove the debt than it would take for the lawsuit to proceed. The lady also told me that they don't have anything with a signature as this is a medical debt. I drafted an official dispute letter, but before I could send it on XX/XX/XXXX my roommate 's daughter was served the paperwork for the lawsuit.

At no point was any contact made to me regarding this debt by any party. It was stated when I called the lawyer 's office that the number I gave at the ER was not valid, that number was my number for 5 months after the supposed ER visit, and yet I was never reached out to in order to collect. I have also never moved so I am unaware of a reason why I was not mailed any notices.

Credit card or prepaid card,"We were charged for four separate charges totaling {$71.00} on our credit card operated by Bank of America ( BoA ) to a XXXX company named XXXX which we did not authorize. We had made one purchase from this company but did not authorize it to keep our credit card information. We did not authorize any further charges nor did we authorize any services or products from this company. Apparently XXXX kept our credit card numbers on their files. We understand this company is a XXXX company. 

We filed a written complaint with BoA on XX/XX/2018 disputing that we had authorized these {$71.00} charges and signed a written statement to BoA to this effect. On XX/XX/2018, BoA wrote us they were "" unable to determine that a billing error occurred based on the information or documentation available to us ... .we consider your disputed resolved and the balance owed. '' We then called BoA and spoke with their representative who said we would have to provide written documentation that we had not authorized the charges for XXXX. We asked how we could disprove that we had not authorized these charges and he could not answer. He acknowledged that BoA had not contacted XXXX asking for my signed authorization for these charges or any information about what these charges entailed. 

We are in an impossible situation. We can not disprove that we did not authorize these charge and have no information as to what these charges involved as the product or service allegedly provided to us. This company evidently kept our credit card information illegally and then used it to bill us for four charges."

I called XXXX XXXX at XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX to find out what happened. I was told my account was in collection and I need to call XXXX. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX. I inquired for the status of account. The rep informed me the account has been in collection. I told the rep I know because I know it on my credit report. I asked the rep for more information on my account. She stated the last payment I made was on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$100.00}. I informed the rep I was not aware of any outstanding balance. We did not use the XXXX XXXX that long to owe {$380.00}. I asked the rep for a copy of the bill. I asked the rep to email it to my personal email address. I spelled my name out letter by letter. The rep said I should receive it shortly.

Today is XX/XX/XXXX. I have not receive a single email regarding my account or balance. To date, I have not received any written notice of my balance from XXXX XXXX or from COLLECTION BUREAU OF AMERICA. I have not been given the option to dispute my account. I was not aware of my account going in collection until I checked my credit report!

We stopped using XXXX XXXX years ago. It is unfair to find out my account is in collection through my credit report. XXXX XXXXXXXX did not notify me of the balance nor the warning my account will go to collection.

COLLECTION BUREAU OF AMERICA did not provide any written notices via mail of my account or my dispute rights. It is unfair to put my account in collection. It is unfair for me to find out through my credit report. It is unfair for me to reach out to the company for the bill and still not receive it.

This practice is unprofessional and unethical. I asked that my account be removed from the my credit report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I contacted TransUnion to notify them that they have scored me using old-outdated information.

I contacted TransUnion to inform them of their mistake and they did remove the bankruptcy from my record. My issue is that even after removing a bankruptcy, my score XXXX with TransUnion did not change at all. How is it even possible that the removal of a very bad record such as a bankruptcy report did not change a credit report score at all???? 

I request that TransUnion recalculate my credit score rating taking in consideration that it no longer has a bankruptcy record. My credit score should be in the 800-850 range!"

I found a truck that I was interested in but had a large scratch on the tailgate and was missing a headrest. I gave XXXX ( salesperson ) my number and told her to let me know if they could repair the scratch and replace the missing headrest and was in my way to look at more trucks. XXXX called me about 15 minutes later stating that her manger approved the minor repairs if I come back to buy it. I returned to the dealer and started the process to purchase the vehicle. After running my credit XXXX informs me that they will not be making any repairs and it is what it is. I told her that was not the agreement and she just shrugged. After getting a manager I was told the same thing we never agreed to that. I cancelled the transaction and will never work with XXXX XXXX again but they have still pulled my credit ( probably several times as most car dealers do ) negatively affecting my score.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was trying to purchase my first home and I decided to go through a first-time homeowners program because I needed help with the process. They pulled my credit to see where I was standing with my score. As they reviewed my report, they told me I had some derogatory items on my report. These suspicious accounts on my report are not mine. They are fraudulent and need to be removed. I never applied for these items.

As I mention in my attached document, Experian stated in this Dispute Report # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX that accurate information can not be deleted. Well, please tell me how in the world an account thats reporting late months with THEM ( in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) are reporting POSITIVE AT XXXX for the lifetime of the accountincluding for those SAME MONTHS they claim I was late! HOW IS THIS ACCURATE? WHY WAS THIS INACCURACY & VIOLATION NOT UPDATED TO POSITIVE? Please tell me how illegally reporting a re-aged account is "" accurate '' information. Or how accounts that have two different "" account open '' dates across bureaus are reporting 'accurately ' with you. THESE ARE ALL VIOLATIONS. I demand that this dispute be expedited due to Experian 's negligence and the disputed accounts be deleted immediately and updated to positive where noted.

My mailbox was broken into on several occasions and someone took my account information and social security number and has been using it to open up credit accounts and other bank accounts. As well they have been using my PNC Bank accounts to pay bills with those creditors. I have had to get a police report and an FTC Affidavit to help me fight these account and to dispute the withdrawals on my three PNC Bank Accounts. I was told to go to a branch and open up a new Virtual Account and get a new debit card and to then dispute all the withdrawals. So I went to the PNC Branch in XXXX, NJ inside a XXXX & XXXX after work and basically it was a complete waste of time. The ladies told me that they could not help me with the disputes because my account was negative and they would not be able to open me up new accounts because my account is compromised right now because it is negative and that the direct deposit I get will be used to cover the negative balance. The account is negative because of all the reversal of provisional credits and the withdrawals. They also stated that there was no information left from the Escalations Department stating that I was a victim of identity theft. You know what I just need some help please.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I, as well as my neighbors, have had multiple credit cards stolen from the mail. 

Most credit card companies, upon being notified, have immediately canceled the card and refunded the fraudulent charges. 

Bank of America, on the other hand, has refused to cancel the charges, claiming since the card was physically present, I am responsible. 

My Bank of America credit card had never been used in the previous 5 years, and yet, upon being used for a number of charges, no fraud alert or notification was sent to me. I personally noticed the charges when I was billed, and immediately notified Bank of America. 

During Bank of America 's investigation they noticed there was another phone number on my account, but they could not identify where that phone number came from. Was it used to activate the stolen card, or did someone else have access to my account? The only thing they claimed was since the card was physically present ( obviously, since it was stolen ), I was liable for those charges, which was a total of {$53.00}. 

As far as I can tell, Bank of America is unable to adequately protect its clients accounts and also unable to adequately investigate fraudulent charges. I have since closed my account, but am looking to get those fraudulent charges dismissed. 

My credit report shows that I normally have thousands of dollars of revolving debt every month, all of which is paid on time. However, I refuse to pay even {$50.00} for charges I did not make."

The company tesponded to the complaint but made no attempt to fix the issue. If I select the option to log in by receiving a code, the code is apparently still being sent to someone else. 
On XX/XX/2019, the bank/credit card services refused to accept my call with a message that it would not accept calls from my phone number.

Checking or savings account,"Hello. 

I've been a customer of Wells Fargo for about five years in DC. 

Recently when I called the automated line they asked me to say my name in order to record it and use it for identification/security purposes. I don't feel comfortable with that because I don't think it's respectful of privacy and I didn't. They put me through to a customer service agent on that call. 

About a month later I called again and this time their automated system would not put me through without me saying my name. This was never asked of me in the past five years. I managed to get through anyway by pressing zero about ten times and made a complaint to them about requiring my name to be said and about trying to get and use my bio-identity without my permission. 

I called them again recently to return the call of their rep who had left me a voicemail. I had deleted the vm by mistake and forgot the caller 's name and this time they required me to say my name before they would look at my account or before they would speak with me. I refused and asked to speak with a supervisor and the supervisor also refused to speak with me without me saying my name. 

She then tried to get me to say my name in a sneaky way, by saying she needs me to say it in order to continue speaking with me and when I asked her if it was for bio-identity purposes she denied it but she would not settle for me spelling my name. She also engaged in other mildly sneaky or disengenous behavior I feel. 

I am going to close my account because this is a dealbreaker at this point but I find it hard to believe that this kind of behavior is legal. 

I would hope that you will prosecute them if it's not legal behavior. Would you please inform me whether what they are doing is legal or not? 

Thankyou very much, XXXX XXXX"

Both have the same interest rate. I told them they should of got rid of the cash advance and only had the purchases. 

Purchases 13.99 % {$2500.00} {$29.00} {$2500.00} Cash Advances 13.99 % {$2500.00} {$30.00} {$2600.00} They Specified per Government regulation that they had to do it this way. So I would like to know if this is indeed accurate or if they could of applied it all to the Cash Advancement and any remaining to the purchases. 

Here was there response to me. I'm not satisfied since I did what there rep told me to do to try to clean this up. 

Upon speaking directly with our credit card department, they stated the following : When payments are made over the minimum, the remainder will be applied to the balance with the highest interest baring balance. If 2 balances are at the same APR, we split the payment between the 2. There are numerous outstanding purchases on this card. Purchases and Cash Advances ( or expired balance transfers ) are at the same rate, therefore the system split the payment between the 2. 

Unfortunately, the Member Service Representative you spoke to may have misunderstood the situation and provided incorrect information. 


Please let me know"
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2018 I went to a store in XXXX, there I made two purchases ( approximately {$160.00} and approximately {$240.00}, depending on the exchange rate ). The merchant took my card behind the counter and did something but then she claimed that the machine, which would print a receipt I was to sign was not working. She gave me two scraps of paper to sign which seemed very strange. Later when the charges appeared on my statement I saw that I was charged {$570.00} and {$680.00}. Naturally I disputed the charges and my bank gave me a temporary credits of {$410.00} and {$440.00}. These credits were later reversed when the merchant sent two fraudulent receipts, with forged signatures that look nothing like mine. There are also itemized containing things I never purchased. And these are also signed with a forged signature.I sent a rebuttal of the reversed charges and filed a police report here in the USA, but the bank refused to recredit me with the funds that were stolen."

Mortgage,"Ocwen Loan Servicing, Now PHH Servicing, Refuses to Answer My Loan Questions, Has Unreasonably long hold times, Provides misleading information. Ocwen Loan Servicing is my mortgage servicer and they have been sued repeatedly by the states for servicing violations. Ocwen continues to violate my rights as a TN consumer and as a mortgage holder by giving me inaccurate information on my loan, refusing to provide someone to be able to answer questions on my loan. Ocwen recently transferred my mortgage loan to a company called PHH Servicing. This company was created by Ocwen Loan Servicing and is OWNED by Ocwen. Ocwen has forwarded all of it's phone numbers to this company. The agents refuse to answer any questions regarding my loan and they have refused to provide me with a person to assist me. They have refused to escalate my concerns to higher management. I called PHH today and asked when was the 89th day for my payment to be made. This is a common question I have asked Ocwen before. I ask this because Ocwen does not start foreclosure proceedings unless the loan is 89 days past due. I have multiple papers showing this from Ocwen as well. The PHH agent I spoke to said they were unaware of this and refused to tell me when was the 89th day. She said they 'did n't do that '. But they do. Ocwen has not changed that policy in writing with me. I asked her for the number to Ocwen and she provided me a phone number that routed me right back to PHH. I spoke to an agent named XXXX. He refused to tell me anything about the loan and even became sarcastic and inferred I should 'look it up myself '. So my own mortgage company will provide no answers for me on my loan. Please do something to help me. Ocwen is continuing to violate my rights. They refuse to answer questions and have told me only one person can assist me and that person works during my work hours and I am unable to speak with them then. Yet their customer service line is open until XXXX XXXX  but they provide no one knowledgeable to be able to speak with me then. The Nightmare Continues Your Desired Resolution : I need an explanation of why I was told by a PHH Servicing agent that they will not honor the 89 day payment delinquency before foreclosure proceedings are started. That has always been Ocwen 's long term policy which Ocwen has reiterated to me in writing on multiple occassions. The PHH Loan Servicing agent said they will not 'honor that '. I spoke with her today, XX/XX/2019. I need Ocwen, PHH Servicing, to deal with me in good faith and provide for me someone during their working hours who can answer any and all questions I have regarding my loan and payment. Although PHH customer service hours run until XXXX XXXX Eastern time, PHH agent XXXX has notified me that my loan has been assigned to someone who leaves very early and after this person goes home no one else in the entire company can assist with my loan or answer any questions. Not even basic questions. The agent even became snippy with me and said I should try to find the answers ' myself '. This is wrong. I need someone to walk me through setting up my account online. I am unhappy with PHH service. Their agents are rude and dismissive and not knowledgeable. I fault PHH Servicing and their parent company Ocwen and I will fault them for any servicing failures that result in foreclosure as well."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",The last attempt to remove inaccurate information to Experian was on XX/XX/2019. One of the addresses on my report of XXXX XXXX XXXX is a location I have never lived at in my life and they will not remove it. It says that a creditor sent information to that address but I never gave it out because I never lived there. And I am not sure who lives at that address. Also the letter included a past address of XXXX XXXX XXXX which I asked to be removed as I have updated my current address with Experian. I have applications pending where my credit will be accessed and it makes my credit file appear scattered as far as the addresses goes.

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a High Yield Savings account with Synchrony Bank which was an online account with a transfer from my personal account in the amount of {$50000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I transferred another {$1500.00} to the same XXXX account. On XX/XX/XXXX, {$45000.00} was wired out of my XXXX account to "" XXXX   XXXX XXXX '' totally without my Knowledge or approval and I have never had an account with XXXX. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, someone transferred out {$14000.00} ( which is more than would have been in the acount ) to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which I also knew nothing about and have never heard of either bank.. Since this was a savings account, I did not look at it ( as I obviously should have ) until XX/XX/2019 when I needed to withdraw some money. I could not access my XXXX online account at that time because the account had been locked, which I also did not know. When I called to inquire about my account, I was told that my account was "" Overdrawn '' by the amount of {$14000.00} and I had to make a deposit immediately to cover that amount. They followed up with a letter saying "" This is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose ''. I have spoken to several different people at XXXX and they will not even consider this as "" Fraud '' and plan on pursuing this against me."

I received no communication from USCB by mail or phone notifying me of the alleged debt and my right to dispute until after I contacted the company. Only after I contacted the company via phone requesting a dunning letter, they sent one. I responded to the letter and they received it on XX/XX/2021, and have failed to provide me with the written information I requested within the timeframe of 30-45 days. It has now been 60 days and I have yet to get a response.

This account is not valid and should be deleted and removed. Experian acknowledged the disputed on XX/XX/2019 and rendered the account verified and accurate on XX/XX/2019. I can not understand how this was investigated in 7 days. I would like a method of verification accordance to FCPA 611 ( 7 ) and I would like it within the 15 days of receiving this notice.

I go back to the bank to ask what's going on and they open an accounting case and that I'd hear from them in at most 10 days. I get a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX stating that "" We have reviewed your case and a debit card adjustment of {$550.00} has been processed to your account on XX/XX/XXXX '' which is just restating the problem that I had in the first place.

We identified the charges as fraudulent and I filed a claim. I was issued a provisional credit and was told it would be made permanent on the conclusion of the investigation. I called back several weeks later and was told the investigation was still ongoing. ( It was unclear why much investigating was required given I had charges at physical locations in Massachusetts  the same day. ) I was told the case required a maximum of 45 days to resolve, yet there was never a permanent credit issued.

I called today, in XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that there was no case and no credit had been issued ( apparently my case had been lost. ) I had to provide all the information again and was told my case ( XXXX  ) will now take another 45 days to resolve. Given how this is obviously fraud and I have already filed a case, I find this timeline unacceptable and have told your representative that.

I expect to be issued a full credit immediately - this is not a difficult investigation and two minutes of analyzing a statement will make apparent that there has been fraud."

Basically I have had the run around and have called on numerous occasions to find out why my credit card was closed.Nobody could answer my question. They would place me on hold for long periods. I was advised that I would get follow-up calls and only one of the agents actually called me back. Again with no idea as to why my account, which is recently opened was closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received two letters from HSBC USA one stated that my credit card was closed ( which I already knew ). and another with my XXXX checking account being closed. There was no specific reason given in the letter. As a result, I called again. The associate and a manager could not tell me the. reason why, I have been on the phone with HSBC USA since I opened my accounts in XXXX ( checking ) and XXXX ( credit card ) for countless hours to verify account information and for them to research my accounts. I haven't had any negative activity on my accounts or reason for my accounts to be closed. I have never had a bank take me through the wringer like this. This has been a nightmare.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX, XXXX and Equifax continues to report this unverified erroneous item on my credit report after multiple dispute attempts. The latest dispute attempt was initiated XX/XX/2019 with all three bureaus and was "" verified '' to be correct. Not only is this charged off account reporting a past due balance for all the bureaus but the last active dates are different between the three bureaus. The payment history is also incorrectly reported with all three bureaus. If the information is correct it should not be so reported so inconsistently between the three bureaus."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","TransUnion continues to report information that resulted from ID theft on my credit report. They violated FCRA 605B several times, Never give me a reason for their decisions, and hide behind "" its our policy ''. If something does not meet their requirements, they are required by law to tell me that and tell me exactly what was missing or incorrect. I just got off the phone with XXXX XXXX, a representative from the specialized fraud department. She admitted the court does not report bankruptcy information to them, they use a third party vendor to obtain the information, which for information obtained before XX/XX/XXXX, would be XXXX. XXXX does not have a bankruptcy on file. So the court does not and did not report this to them, the vendor does not have a record of the bankruptcy in their records, PACER.GOV does not verify or report information to credit bureaus. My last dispute was opened on XX/XX/XXXX and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX claimed the court verified that dispute. Putting aside the fact that the court does not verify any information for credit bureaus, logistically, that is not possible. The court does not used Metro2 software and has no method of electronically receiving a dispute, investigating it and electronically sending it back. The dispute would have to be mailed out and it is not possible to mail something out and receive it back the next day, Even if they miraculously got metro2 / XXXX XXXX just to verify that 1 dispute, it still would not be possible because they are required to conduct a reasonable investigation and they would not be able to do that over night, while they are closed. The result reads '' we verified the information is accurate '', if the dispute was sent out to be investigated by the court or any other company, the result would specify that and would read "" the company that reported the information certified to us that it is accurate. '' I asked XXXX XXXX if it was marked as frivolous or duplicate dispute, she responded with "" it was closed on XX/XX/XXXX sir '' completely dodging the question, I asked her again and she said "" I dont see that '' which is another dodge. Her ability to see it wasnt in question. They refuse to help, and only offer to dispute the information. If I knew for fact they were going to do a proper dispute and investigation, I would have no issues having it disputed, even though by law they are required the block the information, since simply verify ID information does not solve ID theft. ID theft by nature has matching ID information, thats what makes it ID theft. XXXX XXXX said that FCRA requires them to only dispute and FCRA does not allow them to remove items. I was blown away by the amount of false/ inaccurate information a representative from the SPECIALIZED FRAUD department was giving me. Its disgusting that TransUnion is allowed to operate like this, with little to no repercussions. 

. This bankruptcy resulted from identity theft, I did not file it nor hire an attorney to file it for me. It is fraudulent so checking the information on PACER.GOV does not verify that it belongs to me. It provides no new information. It was already known that there was a bankruptcy filed with my information, that is why it is on my credit report. I've contacted PACER and they confirmed that they do not verify the accuracy of information to credit bureaus and although PACER is associated with the court, PACER itself is not a court. The court clerk also confirmed that the court does not verify information to credit bureaus and credit bureaus. 

The accuracy of information on the public record was not what was being disputed, the entire public record is being disputed. The spelling of my name and/or social security number is not the issue, I did not claim this bankruptcy was misrouted to my credit report or it belongs to someone else with a similar name. The bankruptcy was filed using my information without my authorization or knowledge. The identity thief spelling my name correctly is not relevant. If someone steals a car and crashes it, the insurance company is not going to tell the owner who reported the car as stolen "" We verified you were the driver during the accident because the spelling of your name in our records, matches the spelling of your name on the car registration '' That is what you are doing. You are using the fact that the information exists, to verify it belongs to me, after I notified you the information resulted from identity theft and supplied you as the information required by federal law. As stated in Federal statute, 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the existence of the information is not evidence the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer received any goods, services or money as a result of the information. That is exactly what you did. The court did not conduct a reasonable identity theft investigation for you regarding this and certify to you that they verified the bankruptcy was authorized by me or that I benefited from it I am appalled on the way TransUnion has handled this situation. TransUnions wilful and gross negligence violates is unlawful and unethical. This bankruptcy needs to be removed from my report. I notified you in XX/XX/XXXX, and you werepermitted 4 business days by the FCRA to have the information blocked and notify the company who reported it to you of the block and fraudulent status. It has been 3 months, you have neither blocked it nor notified the company that the information resulted from identity theft. 

I certify that the above statement is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief with no misrepresentation or omission of material fact.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Signed up for the Amazon Credit Card as they heavily advertise it. Upon being approved for the card they allowed me to start using it before the card was physically mailed to my house. Unfortunately, you can not signup for auto-bill pay or register an account with the website until the card physically arrives at my doorstep. 

No problem, a few weeks later it arrives, I create a login on the website and immediately sign up for Automatic Bill Payment. This is done successfully and I quadruple check that my payments pay off the full balance ( not just minimum ) during each statement ( like I do with all my accounts ). 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out my payments were being declined. The Synchrony Banking websites are all broken, and all seem to take you to different portals so I called the 800 number. They confirmed that I signed up for auto-pay but they said "" some '' payments ( especially the first ) will not always be automatically billed and need to be manually submitted. Thus, my first payment was never actually paid, and my account is now "" delinquent '' and fees + interest accrued. 

It took a lot of time but I was able to pay the balance, get the fees + interest reversed and close the card, however, this is not enough. Their billing practices and customer support are highly suspicious, asking multiple times ( on the same phone call ) for sensitive PII even after I had given it through the automated system AND to the representative on the phone. Additionally, I have never heard of an account not allowing automatic-bill pay in such an inconsistent manner. This should be fixed and should be in massive letters when signing up for auto bill pay that it doesn't work as the customer might imagine."

I spent {$5000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX which is one month later so I have met the spending requirement for the bonus offer and this is confirmed by American Express when I called them as to why I have not received my bonus points. I noticed on my XXXX account that I had no received any bonus points for opening up the XXXX card in XX/XX/XXXX. I called Amex to inquire why I have not been awarded the bonus points. They told me to contact XXXX and find out why because it was XXXX who denied issuing bonus points to me. So I called XXXX right after I got off the phone with them and a representative said it was because I've received a XXXX bonus before and I did receive one from a XXXX credit card I opened up over 5 years ago.

'' Now, the last sentence said I won't be eligible for the Amex bonus if I have received a bonus or upgrade offer from XXXX in the last 24 months which I have not received a welcome bonus or upgrade offer from XXXX in the last 24 months. The XXXX representative looked into the account and was confused as why I didn't get my bonus points from the Amex card as well so he put in case to be further investigated ( case # XXXX ). He told me I would receive an email response 3-5 days. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX ( two months after I called XXXXXXXX ), I finally get a response saying I received a bonus offer before and wouldn't be getting the XXXX points. XXXX is putting the blame on Amex and XXXX while Amex is putting the blame on XXXX. Amex is  saying I have met the requirements to receive the bonus points.

I contacted customer service to find out the reason, and they said whoever handles that department is closed for XXXX and will return on XX/XX/XXXX so they told me to call back. I called on the XXXX and I was transferred to that department and I asked what is the reason behind the closure to my accounts. They closed 3 of my chase accounts. 2 of them are personal and 1 of them is business. They said the reason why its closed is because you have a XXXX credit card which is linked to XXXX XXXX that has been closed due to non activity for a couple of years. Recently XXXX XXXX XXXX   closed my account as well due to no specific reason. So Chase said since those accounts are closed we decided to close your chase accounts as well. So as of now I had a feeling as if they were asking me what I wanted to do, I said I want you yo reopen my accounts, customer service said we cant open your accounts unless you speak with the supervisor, hes the only one that can reopen the accounts. I said ok and waited for the supervisor to call me. Morning of XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from the supervisor and she sounded from plain, rude, as if she didnt even care whats going on.

While on two separate numbers I told XXXX XXXX that was the name he gave me ) of the frustration and I will have to take it up with the CFPB. Upon hearing it he asked me to wait and came back online and asked me to ask the hangup on the receiver so that he can call the receiver. After few minutes he came back online with me and informed me that he has all the information and the money will be available after 10 minutes. All this took over 30 minutes of my time standing in the XXXX  with everyone listening and severe financial hardship for the receiver. 
I trust the strong US financial regulation and was sure to get my money back, I didnt trust MoneyGram. I had already called my brother in XXXX and asked to wire transfer XXXX immediately to a family who is financial hardship. SHAME ON MONEYGRAM FOR THEIR UNPROFESSIONALISM AND STUBBORNESS."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I filed for Bankruptcy XX/XX/2018 and went on to all three credit bureaus to make sure debts were showing such and if they didnt I disputed them and asked the bureaus to please update or delete the account. All creditors were notified by the US Bankruptcy court XXXX and XXXX did their part and either updated or deleted where Equifax has given me the hardest time getting this one account of my credit report and I disputed it three times since doing the bankruptcy as the confirmed the account that has be included in the bankruptcy and I told the creditor and Equifax on numerous times they are violating the us bankruptcy act but not updating the account to show XXXX balance and included in bankruptcy along with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Colorado XXXX-XXXX  on account # XXXX original creditor American Physicians who already had taken their file off my three reports but this collection agency refuses even after numerous calls to them. Equifax is all refusing and aftr three disputes and I saying that I was filing a Dispute with your agency they want my ID and social security card to make things more hard on me. After completing the last investigation and threats of me filing this dispute items that were removed where put back on my credit file which were included in bankruptcy tonight the added then back down to drop my credit score 128 points in retaliation knowing they were included in bankruptcy under XXXX XXXX.

Checking or savings account,"I have an HSA account with XXXX. Because it charges monthly fees, I decided to open a new custodian account at XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my new custodian sent the transfer request to XXXX. However, XXXX claimed it never received the request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I asked my new custodian to send the second transfer request. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to check if it has received the transfer request. The customer service representative said they have not received any forms. 

During XXXX to XXXX, XXXX continued to charge me {$14.00} fees. I expressed my frustration to the CSR over the phone. She later told me that they did receive the form for XXXX XXXX, but not XXXX XXXX. Obviously, it was a lie. 

I expect the XXXX can process my request and send my money ( and refund of extra charge ) to my new custodian immediately."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX  merely verified that the account in question, SEARS, listed the amount past due correctly. My complaint was that I did not owe SEARS the amount as the account was XXXX   when the items were returned. SO I didn't owe SEARS any money at any time. XXXX   completely did not understand the issue. SEARS needs to fix the bookkeeping error. Item was a dryer. Purchased in XX/XX/2018. Returned XX/XX/2018 because it took SEARS that  long to get someone out to pick it up. The company was at fault. Meanwhile a {$27.00} payment came due and the account never got credited or updated to eliminate the {$27.00} payment that was no longer owed due to the item being returned. I have a letter from SEARS crediting the account but it is not in the statement. It is simple billing error and no one is following up. It just takes one genius ... .please if you're out there this is an easy one ... none  of the customer service reps can follow what I'm saying and my credit has been ruined. It's true SEARS has that amount listed. However, it is not true that I owe it."
Mortgage,"This is my 2nd complaint against American Financial Resources , Inc. within 4 months for the same problem. I received a notice in XXXX stating my escrow account was low and to either pay a full payment of {$750.00} to escrow or it would be added to my payment amount. I paid the full amount before the deadline. I got a new insurance policy at the end of XXXX, same terms with a cheaper premium. Sent in all of the required information within 2 days. Paying the full escrow amount and changing our insurance carrier reduced my overall payment amount. AFR did not make any changes to my account and I was forced to pay what they said so that I would not have any late payments on my credit report or even risk dealing with a foreclosure notice. After everything was finally updated in XXXX, AFR has still neglected to reimburse the overages paid. My last complaint stated to reimburse the overages of {$120.00} and pay directly to principal. I sent an email to customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and there has been no response. Nothing has been done.I am paying AFR more money by paying interest on a mortgage balance that is incorrect. Since it seems impossible for AFR to transfer the extra money to my principal balance, I want the overage sent to me either in a check or direct deposited back into the account in which it came from. If this is not done in a timely manner, I will be forced to hire an attorney and sue for damages. I have experienced nothing but problems since I was approved to buy my house. The application process is a drawn out joke and financing through American Financial Resources , Inc. is just the same. Customer Service Reps do not know what is going on but they will argue with you to the death. I had one lady argue with me to the point that she was actually screaming at me."
Debt collection,"I called IQ Data International Collection company on  Friday XX/XX/2019 regarding a payoff letter for my lender. 

1. I was told that I had to provide a debit card number, expiration date and CVV in order to have my payoff letter "" Generated '' - I hesitantly allowed them to use the card that was apparently already on file, though I personally never once gave them my debit card nor did I ever authorize them to have that. 

2. I have since called back today, XX/XX/2019, as I have not received that payoff letter. The woman I spoke to was able to verify my email address and a comment about how someone was scheduled to send that ( which means they lied, they told me it was already sent during the first phone call ). So I asked if she could resend that. she refused. I asked her who could, She said her boss could but that he wasn't around. 

This is preventing me from buying a mortgage. My closing date is XX/XX/2019."

I have repeatedly called them and sent numerous goodwill letters to try to get to update the late payment history on this card because it affects my chances of getting jobs or even a home. And honestly if it's easier why not just delete it, the account is paid. They consistently tell me that it's not up to them, XXXX  has to do this on there own. They don't have much empathy either, just take the money and not willing to help.

We contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX and filled out all paperwork they gave us, then they did not respond at all for 3 weeks and after I attempted to contact them 3 times, they ignored my requests. I then sent them in a final package of paperwork which they said they never got ( stall technique ) I then found the USPS date of delivery of XX/XX/XXXX and it was delievered to them.

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX representing XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX   ( apartments ) claiming there was a final charge of {$920.00}. There was no statement of charges, no receipts, no explanation of charges, and no proof of any charges owed. I emailed them several times and wrote to them for an explanation of charges and never received any response. Therefore, I turned the matter over to the Attorney General of Idaho, because they needed to contact me within 30 days of move-out to settle charges. The move-out date was XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, 60 days had passed before contact breaking Idaho Code Section 6-321. They also never at any time informed me where my deposit went breaking Idaho Code Section 6-321 and Lease Section 42 of lease signed on XX/XX/XXXX for 10 months. After me contacting the Idaho Attorney General, XXXX XXXX sold the debt to out-of-state company Columbia Debt Recovery XXXX XXXX. I started receiving letters and phone calls from XXXX at Columbia Debt Recovery. ( included ) XXXX threatened to ruin my credit and turn me into all three credit bureaus if I didn't pay this debt. I asked him for the proof or a statement and he claimed he had proof but could not share it with me. He was calling 5-7 times per day. I finally told him that I did not wish to be contacted by phone anymore and only US Mail  under FDCPA and hung up. I disputed the charge with XXXX XXXX and was told it was for extra rent. I did not owe extra rent and everyone agreed on the Move-out date. ( included ) I received a notice on XX/XX/XXXX that my credit had dropped by 32 points and I checked and sure enough, Columbia Debt Recovery, XXXX XXXX has reported this debt to my credit as threatened by XXXX. Please review the included documentation. Idaho Code was broken multiple times and I have never received a straight answer from anyone what the debt is for after asking multiple times.

I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how Equifax, XXXX and XXXX   verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a XXXX XXXX, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. 
Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call Equifax back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All 3 major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine."

The plan of distribution of the amended irrevocable trust is 5050.the condo value was XXXX he took the condo in XXXX, sold it spent the sales proceeds.

They called this half the value of the condo. They also called it the whole value of the condo.fact is, as the account statement showing the transfer says, the overfund was from a distribution in XX/XX/XXXX, made in error to his trust from our mom 's trust estate. In other words, nothing whatsoever to do with the condo. They also created a fraudulent accounting in which they falsely show the condo value as if added twice to the portfolio funding for both trusts"
Mortgage,"In XXXX XXXX I applied with Wells Fargo for a loan modification, I was denied each time. I went to a local group, XXXX XXXX XXXX who advocated for me to get a loan modification that was approved in late XXXX or early XXXX. I have consistently made my payments on time. In XXXX I was advised by someone to call Wells Fargo to see if I could lock in at my current interest rate of 2 %. I called and spoke at length with a representative that said that I could and she would be happy to assist me with this. I always had problems tracking my account and payments on the Wells Fargo website and she said it was no problem, that she would be happy to send me my mortgage monthly payment amount for the life of the loan, I wanted to get this in writing because of all the problems I have had both current and in the past with this lender. I was shocked when I received notification in late XXXX that beginning in XXXX of XXXX my locked in interest rate of 2 % would be going up to 3 %. I immediately called Wells Fargo and after extensive time on the phone, it was really exhausting, they would get back to me. I forwarded to them the document that promised a 2 % loan rate for the life of the loan, excluding insurance and tax increases. I received a very pompous telephone message from a XXXX XXXX, who was so unprofessional with his snide remarks over the telephone message that the document was not going to be honored.

I believe that is completely violating my rights as a consumer and that could place this company or companies in jail for consequences of breaking and violating the law. I can show you how the company violated my rights. The account was placed on my account without my acknowledgment, I wasnt contacted by XXXX, XXXX nor any collections company. I stated and sent in certified verifying documents. You have now violated my rights through the FCRA the debt buyer or CRA have failed to comply with its obligations, I am able to sue for violations of the FCRA.

As a victim of identity theft and currently trying to correct the damage done by my stolen identity, I have followed the Federal Trade Commission Identity Theft step by step program and monitor my credit reports daily. I just received a response to my request to remove the unauthorized inquiries stating that the inquiries would NOT be blocked and would remain on my credit report for 2 years. Obviously, I am unable to send any evidence that the inquiries were not authorized other than the Identity Theft documents that I have provided all credit reporting agencies on XX/XX/XXXX. As stated previously, these inquiries are contributing to the reasons why I have recently been unable to obtain credit.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I was warned by my card company ( by phone ) that two XX/XX/XXXX resort charges for {$1100.00} and {$600.00} looked like possible fraud. I informed the card representative that my daughter and I did not make these charges. He cancelled our cards. Later, I receivied a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the two resort charges. I called a card representative and told him the two charges were on my bill. He cancelled our cards again. Next, I received a card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX that still had the resort charges and interest on those charges. I sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX to the card company complaining and asking removal of the fraudulent charges and interest from my account. I then received the card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX with the fraudulent charges and more interest still on the bill. I sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX complaining and requesting a reply by XX/XX/XXXX. I then received the card company XX/XX/XXXX letter stating : "" Per our records your account was issued a credit from the merchantin the amount of {$600.00}. Therefore, we have billed your account {$600.00}. This correction shows on your XX/XX/XXXX statement. We now consider this investigation complete. '' I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying I had not received a credit of {$600.00} from the resort. The card company then replied by their letter strangely dated XX/XX/XXXX saying I was previously rebilled for the {$600.00} charge, and they had recredited my account for this amount. The adjustment would appear within one to two billing cycles.The card bill for XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX showed the {$600.00} credit, but it showed a balance that included the original fraudulent charges plus interest. ( I admit that I did not initially notice that the original fraudulent charges were still included in the balanced owed. ) I then sent my letter of XX/XX/XXXX saying that my card bill should only contain my current charges. I want my futures billings to only show what is owed from current charges and no interest. I always pay the full blance that I owe on my cards ( minus fraudulent charges ) so that I never incur any interest."

I contacted the company directly and spent an hour and a half trying to get to the right person that could help me. Unfortunately, no was able to help me and told me they cant change the interest rate. They also made the statement that they didnt see any promotional offer entered on the application. 

I informed them that I entered the promotional code XXXX that was on the paperwork they advertised to me. They said they couldnt do anything to help me. They also informed me that I dont have to keep the card. At this time my credit has been affected by their inquiry and will effect further applications and percentage rates. Due to the consequences I feel Citi is liable to deliver what they have advertised. Otherwise this should be considered a case of bait and switch."

Equifax representatives claim my consumer statement has been removed, yet every single day I login to my account and my consumer statement is still there. 

Each and every one of the Equifax representatives Ive spoken to on the phone are extremely difficult to understand as they speak English very poorly. I do not yet speak XXXX well enough to discuss my issues in their native language, so unfortunately we must communicate in English, in which understandably they are not proficient. I have tried to get around the immense language barrier by sending my request in writing via certified letter, but this also continues to be ignored by them.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a dispute with Chase Bank for {$2000.00} on a {$4700.00} charge with XXXX XXXX, the details are as follows : On XX/XX/XXXX I paid {$4700.00} for a seat advertised as a fully lie flat bed on a 15 hour flight from XXXX to XXXX. Once in the air at altitude, I discovered that the seat did not fully recline as advertised, and functioned more as an economy seat. I mentioned it to the flight crew, the seat was not fixable. I had no recourse to fix this, was stuck in a broken seat beyond my control. Once landing, I reached out to XXXX to explain the issue. Their response was to credit me {$200.00}. I responded that this was not acceptable, the credit was far too low given that the {$4700.00} seat did not function as advertised for a 15 hour flight. XXXX did not remedy the situation, so I filed a dispute with Chase. 

The response from Chase was wholly inadequate and disingenuous. Chase responded that because I accepted services from XXXX, I was not entitled to any refund and my dispute was denied. 

I find this unacceptable and incorrect. I purchased a seat that was explicitly sold as a lie flat bed, this is the reason I bought it for a 15 hour flight. Once in the air, there was literally nothing I could do, so a refund is clearly necessary."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Trans Union, XXXX and XXXX are not responding to any of my requests to investigate, verify and remove fraudulent/unauthorized inquiries from my credit report/file."
Debt collection,"This complaint stems from a fraud/hacked account case with XXXX. On XX/XX/2019, I received an email written in XXXX from XXXX confirming my request to transfer {$1000.00} from my bank account to my XXXX account. As I did not do this, I immediately contacted XXXX to cite the fraudulent transfer ; the email I was directed to contact for potential fraud cases was XXXX '. After contacting them, I was ensured a case was opened to look into my fraud request. A couple days later I saw {$1000.00} was withdrawn from my bank account. XXXX then refunded the {$1000.00} and froze my account and I thought the episode was over. 

A few weeks later I started getting emails from XXXX requesting I pay {$1000.00} because my XXXX account had a - {$1000.00} balance. When they finally called, I explained that a fraud case had been opened ( I provided the case number ) because {$1000.00} had been taken from my bank account but that it appeared to have been resolved and XXXX said ok. 

About 2 months later, starting in late XX/XX/XXXX/early XX/XX/XXXX, I started getting calls from unlisted numbers. A voicemail was left from someone saying they represented ACI,  American Coradius International LLC, and they were calling to collect an {$1000.00} debt I owed to XXXX. After reading about debt scams, I waited until I received a letter in the mail to confirm this was a legitimate company. I finally received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX asking I pay a debt for XXXX. ACI called again and this time I informed them that I owed no debt and explained the fraud case I had with XXXX. I let them know I was filing a complaint with the FTC and they asked me for all of the proof of my fraud case. As I do not trust this company, I said no and I was giving it all directly to the FTC. 

Ultimately, I am not sure who exactly is at fault between ACI and XXXX, but due to the months of harassment over {$1000.00} I do not owe because my XXXX account was hacked, I am filing a complaint. I have screenshots of all my email correspondence with XXXX as well as my bank statement showing the money withdrawn from my bank account and being refunded. I also have a timeline of events : XX/XX/XXXX - unauthorized transfer request, complaint filed. 
XX/XX/XXXX - case opened, {$1000.00} withdrawn from personal bank account into XXXX account. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX refunds {$1000.00}. 
XXXX XXXX - password to XXXX account changed, account frozen. 
XX/XX/XXXX - negative XXXX balance reported. 
XX/XX/XXXX - negativeXXXX balance reported, call with XXXX to resolve issue. 
XX/XX/XXXX - negative XXXX balance reported. Late XX/XX/XXXX - Calls from ACI started, requesting debt of {$1000.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX - letter received from ACI requesting {$1000.00}. 
Today - filing complaint. 

As I never authorized any transfer of funds and had an account compromised, I feel my time continues to be wasted by requesting a debt I never owed. I would like the CFPB to inform ACI to stop harassing me about this debt. I am happy to provide any evidence necessary to the CFPB to back up my account or speak on the phone. Thank you."

On XX/XX/XXXX, with the help of my new lender calling several times as well as myself, I was able to get a breakdown on a spreadsheet of how my payoff funds were applied and the shortage amount from the XX/XX/XXXX closing. I contacted RMSC several times to ask how to send the shortage amount. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to customer service. They took my shortage amount payment over the phone using a debit card and said I would receive a letter stating my loan was now paid off along with an apology because of the "" back and forth for so many months. '' Those documents never arrived. I checked my online account on XX/XX/XXXX and found the money they collected over the phone was labeled as suspense/unapplied funds. When I called, I was told I needed to pay more to settle the account because the "" payoff '' had increased since XX/XX/XXXX. I was also told that their cashiering department did not know how to apply the original shortage amount I paid on XX/XX/XXXX. RMSC is still making escrow disbursements even though I notified them of the situation and spoke to them several times since XX/XX/XXXX. I got their Consumer Ombudsman involved however she was not able to help me reach a resolution. I have also been reported late to the credit bureaus by RMSC for the last two months because they are saying that I haven't paid my regular payment due XX/XX/XXXX and I'm now reported as late 60+ days. I was told by several reps that my account would not be reported late because it was "" on hold '' or "" frozen ''. I have since been declined a vehicle loan because of this specific negative credit account and my score has decreased 53 points since XX/XX/XXXX. RMSC has the shortage money but they will not apply it to my payoff and close this matter after nearly 5 months and over 20 phone calls and 30 emails. I have also filed a complaint with my state 's attorney general 's office and asked for assistance from a HUD Counselor."
Mortgage,"We started a morgage with home town lenders out of XXXX AL the second week of XX/XX/2019. 
We chose to change companies when the broker we are working with left home town lenders. 
I have contacted them through two different individuals both with emails so it would be in writing that we have chosen to leave and go with another lender. 
However we have gotten the run around over our appraisal needing to be released to our lender, they will not even let me know the full cost so that I can pay for it. 
Home town lenders is supposed to work for their customers correct? 
Their doing nothing but causing us unwanted grief I feel because we decided to move to another lender. 
I contacted their cooperate office today, and still have no updates, I feel they are dragging their feet because they know they can. 
Could you please help us receive the cost total so we can pay it and help us be sure they forward the appraisal document so you can close on our house. 
Thank uou"

Mortgage,"Amerisave Mortgage ( also operating under aliases like XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) My experience with Amerisave was horrific. They wasted 9 weeks of my time, {$1500.00} ( not including the extra {$500.00} for the appraisal ), hard hit my credit report under AmeriSave on XX/XX/19 and XX/XX/19 and the above aliases twice on XX/XX/19 ( which I was told not to worry about because my loan officer would "" remove those '' and "" it was just something they have to do on their end to help people out and it would RAISE my credit score '', when infact it lowered my score. They intentionally performed multiple hard hits, in order to require me to find alternate ways to "" pass underwriting ''. I began the process with AmeriSave and paid {$500.00} for the "" loan application fee ''. Inwas informed that AmeriSave charges that fee upfront to prevent people who weren't serious in obtaining a home loan from AmeriSave and not "" waste their time '' and the {$500.00} went towards paying for the appraisal of my home upfront. So, throughout this process, which I was "" guaranteed '' to be at the closing table within 15 days "" no problems '', AmeriSave manifested reasons why I couldn't qualify in order to continue charging me {$500.00} for additional processing times without informing me. My loan officer asked me if anyone could be a "" non-occupant co-borrower ''. My ex-husband agreed to be the non-occupant co-borrower as long as he would not be on the AmeriSave loan or required to be financially liable in the event I defaulted. My loan officer ensured him, 1. He would not be on the loan, his income was only propping my income up and helping me qualify 2. His credit would not be pulled or effected and 3. Adding him was all that was necessary for underwriting to approve the loan and I would be at the closing table within 5 days. Ofcourse, those three things did not happen and AmeriSave, without authorization charged another {$500.00} to add him as a non-occupant co-borrower. My appraisal had already been  completed, so there was no need for another {$500.00} charge. Then, my loan officer told me that underwriting asked if my ex-husband would agree to be a full co-borrower and if so, underwriting would immediately approve to fund my loan, and in 6 months, AmeriSave would just "" drop him off the loan '' as long as I had no late payments. My ex-husband agreed to be a full co-borrower. AmeriSave then charged another {$500.00} without my knowledge or authorization. When the credit card payment came due, I looked at the itemized charges and this is when we noticed all the {$500.00} extra charges. I immediately contacted my loan officer by email and phone. Suddenly, after weeks of daily calls and emails, I was unable to reach my loan officer. He ignored me for over a week. Finally, I received a call from my loan officer and he informed me that 1. Each time he made changes to my original application, {$500.00} was charged so that I wouldn't pull out of the process which would've wasted their time and hardwork put in 2. Each time a change was done AmeriSave had to pull my credit but for me not to worry when I saw the multiple hard hits under aliases as well, because those would be removed 3. AmeriSave was not going to resubmit my loan application with my ex-husband as a full co-borrower because underwriting had already flagged my loan as a denial, so it would be a waste of time. He then said he wished me luck. When I tried to address getting {$1000.00} refunded for the "" additional '' loan changes, he abruptly ended the call and told me, "" XXXX, do not contact me again, you're not getting anything back, anything refunded, and the hard hits will remain on your credit since you are harassing me and AmeriSave. '' After trying to go above his head, I was ignored. After weeks of promises, AmeriSave simply kept manifesting false reasons of why my loan was getting kicked back from underwriting, just to charge me more money. AmeriSave is nothing but a scam. My new lender informed me of the legal process and gave me this website to report my complaint against AmeriSave. I noticed in your database that AmeriSave has multiple complaints and resolutions. I hope you can help me resolve mine. One more addition, my first loan officer was honest and local. Soon after, I was told that loan officer was no longer with the company and my new loan officer was located in Georgia ( I live in Texas )."
Debt collection,"In XX/XX/XXXX our leased XXXX XXXX XXXX was damaged during the flood and we submitted a claim to insurance company that the car is irreparable.

I was overseas for work at the time, I did receive a call from them on or about XX/XX/XXXX, where they were trying to confirm if we received a letter and indicating that {$150.00} was due and payable. I asked them to send by email, which they did. I forwarded the request to my husband, who was in US and asked him to settle. My husband sent a check dated XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$150.00}, which cleared our checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. In meanwhile, XXXX reported the amount as charged-off. My credit history has only 1 account reported being late for payment, which is XXXX XXXX in XXXX with indication 30-59 Days Past due. Everything else is in good standing, no late payments, no defaults, no derogatory remarks. After this charge-off amount got posted to the credit report, our credit scores have dropped significantly. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I have written to XXXX indicating that they placed an undue burden on us where this {$150.00} is creating undue limitations to our financial freedom and demanded that this record be expunged from our Credit Report. They responded that they did everything properly. Please note, nowhere in the contract that I had signed there is a clause that I would have agreed that XXXX IS awarded such right. I consider this frivolous behavior. Where does 20 days have come from, why is it 20, not 10 or not 30? is it 20 calendar or business days? I have opened several claims with XXXX, trying to explain and fix the issue. They made a comment on the report that the account was paid, but remained the CO remark and "" XXXX XXXX Off ''. This doesn't help though. We have recently applied for a mortgage and were denied with comments "" there is a serious delinquency on your credit report '' ; "" delinquent account appears to be recent ''. At this time I am looking for assistance on legal remedies that are available to me. I am intending to bring a suit to court as this burden is so undue and has caused us substantial moral suffering. I am also looking for an instrument, where I, as an individual, can be awarded an equal right to place financial burden on XXXX at my discretion of 10, 20 or 30 days."

Chase informed me the credit card company would not intervene with any disputes with XXXX and validated all charges on my account including the {$500.00} charge. 

I notified the credit card company that I no longer agree to pay any charges to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and Chase still authorized and validated charges. The dispute customer service agent said that I should've changed my account number when I called in for the initial dispute because XXXX could change its address or name and rebill because the company has my card number. This was never advised during my initial call to dispute the {$490.00} charge. Chase sent me a copy of the XXXX agreement and stated it would not intervene with a service agreement which contradicts Chase 's financial services agreement with me. XXXX misrepresented itself and lied to me. I disputed the {$500.00} Further, Chase has communicated in an aggressive and unprofessional manner as if I am not its financial customer. It has stopped sending me statements, altered my online statements and email addresses ; has refused to send statements to me ( I was assessed a late fee but Chase never mailed me a statement ) because my attorney sent a demand letter. I paid everything but the XXXX charges which left a {$990.00} balance on my card. I do not use the card for anything but a monthly membership of {$24.00} and no my balance is over {$1500.00}.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a Capital One account, and had a balance transfer promotion on the account per a bathroom remodel. My line of credit on the card is $ XXXX, and the balance as of XX/XX/XXXX was {$8500.00}. I have since paid {$8100.00}. 

My issue is as follows : I moved in to temporary housing in XX/XX/XXXX and requested a change of address. The address was not changed and as a result I did not receive statements until the XXXX statement was forwarded by the post office. The account has been on auto pay since the commencement of the balance transfer promotion, which included a balance transfer fee. Capital One was receiving payments all along. I since called Cap One due to the forwarding label and old address reflected on the statement and they confirmed the address had not been changed as requested, but they would proceed to make the update. 

The address change issue led to my account being charged interest I believe for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX due to the balance transfer offer having expired. I had no other transactions other than the promo. I called the customer service department twice speaking with XXXX and XXXX ( ID XXXX ). Both acknowledged the address issues and non receipt of statements being very apologetic. Yet, they indicated Cap One does not adjust interest charged. They totally refused to escalate the call indicating they are sr. representatives and that is where it stops because they do not have the ability to transfer calls to their own supervisor or to escalate matters further. 

I called the executive office as I feel I have been treated unfairly and discriminated against and they advised me that all escalations have to go through their general customer service department. This is a large bank and it is unfathmable that this is the way they operate their business and treat customers. I am requesting that the interest charged of {$350.00} be adjusted. Credit card companies are required to provide monthly billing statements to customers, and the fact that Cap One did not do this and conveniently the Balance Transfer promo was to expire makes me believe that it was intentional. I am disputing the interest charged and am requesting an immediate refund for the amount. This will bring my account balance to XXXX.

Mortgage,"I was closing out my loan and I had to close later than schedule because of my wire transfer not coming in on time as of XX/XX/XXXX. So, I was already stressed out. On XX/XX/XXXX, I receive a phone call from XXXX XXXX stating that I never submitted docs for XXXX XXXX. However, I submitted the bank account activity in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX admitted in her e-mail that she assumed that I was going to use my XXXX account because I had enough funds. But, the thing is I had more funds in my XXXX account. Why would she not assume that the funds would come from XXXX account? So, now, I had to drop everything to close on XX/XX/XXXX. I was faxing documents to XXXX like crazy, even into my lunch break! XXXX didn't even know that I had two accounts with XXXX XXXX. One account was closed. She didn't even know that and was asking for statement on the closed account when there was another account that was opened. I had to tell her that! She just asked for all the documents even the ones that I already submitted in XX/XX/XXXX! When I told her that I already submitted that she responded in her e-mail, "" Okay, maybe we don't need that. '' She was asking for documents that I submitted in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX! It was terrible working with her! 
So, I contacted the cooperate office and XXXX XXXX responded. She said she was going to do an investigation. She e-mailed me saying that she was concluding that I closed on XX/XX/XXXX because my wire transfer did not come in on time. However, I did not make a statement that I closed on XX/XX/XXXX because of XXXX. I was talking about XXXX being unorganized that she caused me more unnecessary stress. Secondly, granted that my wire transfer came in late, however, had I not dropped everything and jump on it to fax everything over to XXXX, I would not have been able to close even on XX/XX/XXXX either. Also, why does my wire transfer coming in late have anything to do with XXXX not being on top of her job and asking for documents that I submitted nine months ago? I believe had XXXX done her investigation properly, she should have known that XXXX only received the docs on XX/XX/XXXX which continued into my lunch break ; and she would have found out that XXXX did not have my XXXX XXXX   information which means, even if my wire transfer happened on XX/XX/XXXX, I still had to go through this process! How does XXXX not being able to provide proper customer service because she was not on top of her job have anything to do with my wire transfer not coming in on time?

Debt collection,"I am forced to file a complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX and the HP Sears Company whom they hired to attempt to collect a fraudulent debt, and for there non communication after I sent them a detailed report and breakdown of there incorrect charges they are attempting to collect from me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I rented an apartment located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ca XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX, a local property management company. 

Upon taking possession of the property, I move in inspection was performed on XX/XX/XXXX and was confirmed receipt by virtue of a received by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. This move in inspection is the basis of my defense and complaint. I am attaching it to this correspondence. In this move in inspection I noted extensively the damages on the property and frankly the overwhelming amount of things wrong, broken, dirty, scratched, take up almost 10 pages of notes wherein I detail all the issues that were identified upon moving in. 

NONE of these issues were addressed throughout the year I rented from them. I wanted to move out many times but understood I was under a least and was unable to incur the costs of breaking the lease. Once my lease was coming up for Renewal, I advised XXXX that I would not be renewing and that I would be vacating the property on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a written notice from XXXX with a list of purported charges that was frankly absurd. After communicating with them about the itemization and why I disagree with it, they revised it slightly, but still insisted on charging me for items that were already damaged, broken, dirty, etc - and began to make unsubstantiated allegations of pets being kept at the apartment and event alleged that other adults not on the lease resided in the property, false statements to attempt to justify there chargers. I advised them that my Deposit of {$600.00} was more than enough to cover any reasonable expenses associated with my move out, and that I actually expected some of that money back. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notification from HP Sears, a 3rd party debt collection agency attempting to collect a debt on behalf of XXXX XXXX. I again, explained the situation thoroughly to the representative and even took the time to send him several pages of documentation to defend myself from these bogus charges, and advised him I wanted this account canceled as I had more than enough evidence to substantiate my claim. 

As of that date I have continued to try to resolve this amiably with HP Sears company but they never responded to my requests or presented any compelling evidence or reasons why I would owe this money, and maintain a derogatory credit remark on my credit report that has significantly impacted my credit score and is now hurting my ability to obtain favorable financing and thus costing me tens of thousands of dollars in damages. 

For the record, I am going to breakdown the charges against me. 

{$190.00} For 6 days of rent ( XXXX ) {$410.00} For Paint and Wall Repair ( Somehow Prorated against me ) {$310.00} for carpet replacement ( Also Prorated against me ) {$130.00} -New Keys, AC Filters , Smoke Alarms , Shades ( Not responsible for smoke alarms or AC Filters and the broken blinds were listed in the move in statement as broken ) - They are also including a charge here for "" checking '' plumbing which is not my charge to pay, among the other items listed in this breakdown that were either listed in the move in statement or are not tenant responsibility per California Law. 
{$120.00} - Screen Door Replacement + Labor ( Noted in my Move in Statement that it was torn ) {$86.00} Drip Pans/Bowls Replacement So As you can see, they are charging me for {$1200.00} of which I only agree with {$300.00}. {$190.00} for the six days of rent, the re-keying of the doors ( {$25.00} worth of charges, and {$75.00} that I would deem reasonable to cover up any nail holes ) - Therefore, since they have my deposit of {$600.00}, less the {$300.00} in charges I accept, I am owed {$300.00} plus any interest that has been accumulated."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I called bridgecrest costumer service representative to ask for a payment extension. This information came from their website, it is to help people when they are in need. Well the young lady that I talked to, refused to address the program at first. She was a very fast talker and persuaded me to pay something as if it was going to help with the payment extension. So I paid {$150.00} out of {$420.00}. She asked if she could schedule a payment of {$420.00}. I agreed thinking this would help prevent me from receiving a late payment. She took my debit card information and immediately tried to take the money out right then. This resulted in an insufficient fund fee. The money that was deducted for the fee then decreased the amount available for the bill that was supposed to come out. So I ended up with 2 fees for that one as well. I had to pay over {$1400.00} in repairs and I pay for rides to go to work. So pushing the payment back would have been life-saving for me. So she didnt do the plan, I received a 30 day late on My credit report dropping me 75 points. This was what I was trying to avoid. I explained this to her. But she didnt care. I called customer dispute, but she told me after pulling the call that she didnt sign me up like promised and that she wasnt able to remove the late payment. Even though I followed the protocol. I havent had one bad experience with bridgecrest despite the reviews. Their website says they strive for customer service. I just want them to live up to it. This late payment just cost me my first home."
Mortgage,"I refinanced my loan through Interactive Mortgage. After the loan had closed which cost me a higher interest rate and an additional upfront cost of {$630.00} for an interest adjustment of 4.250 to 4.375 % because the closing department claim that the paperwork I submitted for my student loans did not actually specific how much my payment would be in XXXX. Currently I am not paying anything which I submited documents to support. I dismissed this because I wanted my payment to drop down from {$1500.00} to XXXX. However, after I had signed loan documents to obtain the payment of {$1400.00}, I received a call from XXXX XXXX of Interactive stating that I owe approximately {$400.00} more for hazardous insurance. I was baffled by this because my loan closing statement included a breakdown of my fees in which there is a charge for hazardous insurance of 13 months @ {$56.00}. The insurance quoted now is 13 months@XXXX. I received a letter from XXXX XXXX that my insurance is {$690.00} total. I am not sure why I am being ask to pay this additional amount. When I received the call from XXXX XXXX I was asked to come up with {$400.00} approximately because of the insurance being renewed. Than on Saturday after checking my loan documents I find a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX applying additional cost to my loan that equaled {$210000.00}. My initial loan amount was for {$210000.00} now because I told XXXX I had to examine the paper work I now had to pay over {$2000.00} extra for this loan.

Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2018, we switched insurance carriers to XXXX for our homeowner 's policy., making sure to buy the same coverage that we previously had with XXXX . In XX/XX/XXXX, we received a letter from Wells Fargo stating that we did not have coverage for wind damage. Shocked, we called XXXX and were assured we did indeed have coverage. We then called Wells Fargo, staying on the line over an hour, and were told that the issue was settled. In XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter -- same issue. We immediately called and again stayed on the line for almost two hours, this time while the Wells Fargo rep called XXXX. When she finally returned, she assured us that this time the problem had been dealt with. The next letter we received from Wells Fargo informed us that since we had not purchased wind coverage, they were buying a policy for us -- for {$1300.00}, {$500.00} more than the policy we bought from XXXX. Once again, we called, were on the line over two hours, and found out that Wells Fargo needed a declaration page from XXXX. It is a mystery to us why that fact had not been revealed previously. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo went ahead and took {$1300.00} out of our escrow account for the policy we did not need. The failure of Wells Fargo to correct an error they made, one that they assured us had been corrected three times, is unacceptable. We are older people with health issues, and this has caused us a great deal of stress and worry. We read over complaints on your web site and found others have had the same problem with Wells Fargo, so we can't help but wonder if this is a new scam cooked up to defraud consumers, similar to the credit card scam in recent years. We have advanced college degrees and were able to navigate the extremely and unnecessarily complex process to have this problem fixed. Many consumers would not have resources to do so. We would like assurance that, going forward, Wells Fargo will correct their errors quickly and with less time and effort required by their customers."

I immediately went on the XXXX XXXX website because I receive email alerts anytime there is a change to my credit score. I had not received an such email. The website stated that my credit score was XXXX and that had been the score on a chart for the last year. I then used a tool to update my credit score and it increased to XXXX. I also followed up with a phone call ( ridiculously hard to get through and the person I spoke to is XXXX, so was the supervisor I spoke to. I repeatedly asked to speak to someone in the United States and got denied. ) They did confirm that my credit score was XXXX but that there were different models use to determine scores and that I would need to talk to XXXX about the model used.

The dealership did not give a choice on choosing the car either and took advantage of my situation, when I said that the interest rate is very high then they told me that you can refinance the car after Paying 8 to 12 installments. Which was a lie because the finance company they hooked me with refuse to refinance the car after I made 13 payments. Now due to coronavirus I am unable to work and asked for a gold on my auto loan which is not taken into consideration. I tried to refinance the car with other banks and credit unions but they refuse to finance this car as it is e most basic car has no options and the value of the car is only XXXX $ where they sold me this car for XXXX $ plus XXXX $ interest for 72 months. After paying 13 installments of XXXX $ and down payment of XXXX XXXX I still owe the finance company XXXX XXXX And on the other hand this has not even helped me with my work with XXXX/XXXX  as this cars fuel consumption is very high.

With that document in hand, Experian reported that they verified the item is mine, but in alternate, having been provided documents from the social security administration of the only provided name identification with my social security number, Experian decided on its own to add names to my file without factual verification. In addition due to the unsecurity of the credit reporting system of Experian during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2019, Experian has allowed some person or entities to run my credit, access my credit, or gain access illegally without permissible purpose over 65 times, when addressed with Experian their tag line is with permissible purpose, but having been unable to provide a credit application signed to give such access. In fact having contacted each of the entity, no credit application of signature available, each indicated that such was performed by phone or by the internet, without identifying verification. Experian is operating a lying dispute process, and a credit reporting company that allows access, without verification of its vendors."
Checking or savings account,"This is not the first time that I have an issue with Citibank 's dispute department. Every time I call, it seems that nobody knows what's going on. They tell me that they are making a note in the system that whomever picks up afterwards can't see. 

I contacted Citibank at some point in midXX/XX/XXXX about a XXXX transaction that I had cancelled because the recipient couldn't withdraw the funds. XXXX was very fast in answering my emails about the whereabouts of the funds. They informed me that the transaction was successfully cancelled and that the funds were credited back to my debit card in the amount of {$150.00}. They sent me an email with the date, amount, transaction ID number, card number where the funds were refunded. All this information was provided to Citibank along with a signed explanation of what happened. This was a form that Citibank mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX. I mailed it back to them on XX/XX/XXXX.

I disputed the account history in order to have the report corrected, and at that time, XXXX XXXX XXXX  appears to have added another 30-day late status to each of my reports. 

I only paid this account late one time. In fact, every single other payment aside from that one were made early. If that's not the case, I'd like XXXX XXXX XXXX  to furnish documentation to prove otherwise. 

Clearly this is not accurate, and I'm quite sure they're retaliating against me for the less than favorable reviews I left them on XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX."

I attempted contacting Bank of America and was told 5 reps later that their verification process was online only and that they could not receive a call from the jobs bank. My job gave me a copy of the payroll check to show that it was cashed and verified by Bank of America. I walked into a branch to furnish proof that they had the funds and was told that there is nothing they could do and that no one could release a hold.

Within the letter that I provided to the CFPB is clear what i requested specifically and expected in return from RMCB .... 
However, what I received was a bunch of coded numbers and my name & address With no signature from the original creditor they represent .... 
I immediately called RMCB and asked why they did not provide proper validity of the debt and I was told by a representative they were unable to provide the items requested in my letter do to HIPPA Laws .... 
So I further ask the representative about the information I received about the debt that didnt have a signature and she made it very clear the information was not sent by their company and that the original creditor sent the information. 
So I immediately called the original creditor to ask why they did not provide a signature on the documents I received. 
XXXX made it very clear they did not send the documents and asked me what was the name on the actual exterior envelope? 
I then told the representative of XXXX it was sent from RMCB which is why I was calling because I was confused to who sent it. 
She indicated what the documents was but informed me they did not send them as stated by RMCB that denied sending them. 

So I am first not understanding why RMCB would deny sending this info and why RMCB is not respecting the law thats very clear according to FTC and FDCPA, for a proper validation of debt."
Mortgage,"My mortgage was sold to Flagstar for servicing. The date of the first notice I received was the XXXX statement.

Once I established online banking access, inaccurate amounts owed showing on online banking access. It appeared like I had missed 3 month 's payments but when I spoke to customer service, they gave me opposing information, and they were confused too. They "" guessed '' that the following months ' payment due was also showing as late, in error. 

My rights were not protected during RESPA period! Worse than their erroneous and inaccurate info and reporting, I started getting threatening communication from Flagstar mortgage without regard to the RESPA Service Transfer period.

Since being approved for this card, my income has increased by {$20000.00} a year. I made a payment of {$400.00} ( when the minimum payment was {$100.00} or less ) on XX/XX/19 and then on XX/XX/19 my limit was decreased to {$1800.00} which has hurt my credit score and precludes me from getting a personal loan. Further, in XXXX, I made no purchases ( and haven't in months ) but the regular fee, interest and late fee pushed me over the {$1800.00} limit which I thought was illegal for a credit card company to do under the CARD Act to be maxed over your new limit by fees charged within 45 days of the decrease. 
I paid {$250.00} in XXXX to be under the limit again but am experiencing severe hardship."

When I was back on my feet again, all the other companies I dealt with helped me to get my accounts up to date, and I was within a couple of months. All Synchrony ever wanted was complete payment of any past due account, with all kinds of interest and late fees. When I finally got fed up with trying to deal with them, I just took their out, turned the accounts basically into a loan, and then closed the two accounts. The fun started weeks later when FOUR other cards I had with them, accounts that were NEVER late -- 3 of them didn't even have a balance -- were suddenly closed! No reason given, just closed! And up until all this started happening, I had MORE THAN TEN YEARS of use of their accounts with no late payments or any other problems.

( loan request summary attached ) On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called First Citizens Bank to acquire a HELOC for an amount of {$150000.00} for home improvements. On XX/XX/XXXX a representative from First Citizens informed me that they would approve us for {$75000.00} with an adjustable rate of prime minus 0.26 % for a period of 25 years. We accepted those terms and signed the HELOC loan documents on or about XX/XX/XXXX. The closing statement ( attached ) clearly showed that {$15000.00} was paid to me directly and there was {$60000.00} in undisbursed funds. 

When I contacted the First Citizens representative for instructions on how to receive the funds, she sent me a screen shot of her computer ( attached ) showing we already had a balance due on the HELOC of {$66000.00}. When I asked her how could that be, she said they paid off the original second loan balance of {$51000.00} with proceeds from the new HELOC. 

ON XX/XX/XXXX I sent the email below to First Citizens representative, XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Ext. XXXX Phone "" You are going to have to show me something in writing, either from one of your emails, or the on the closing documents that shows that $ 51,000+ of funds from the new heloc were to be paid to First Citizens to pay off the existing 2nd.

There is nothing in the loan docs that shows funds were to be used to pay off the original loan.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I filed complaint XXXX with CFPB and XXXX  Case # XXXX about the inaccurate derogatory information on my credit file. My credit file still shows charges and invalid payment dates that contradict my credit file. The balance and amount are not correct and the charges are inaccurate. About a month ago I filed a ftc identify theft report because some of the charges on this account, I have no knowledge of. The company could not tell me where these charges came from. I attempted to reach out to the company to get this corrected, but it still remains on my credit file. I am not sure how the additional charges got on my account, I also created a police report in order to dispute this information on my credit file. By law if there are fraudulent charges the company reporting the fraudulent charges have to remove this information due to my sworn affidavit and police report. But this company is still reporting this inaccurate information on my credit file. I am appalled that I had to go this far to clear my name when I have contacted this company numerous times. My credit file is all I have to represent my creditworthiness. This invalid information is damaging my creditworthiness and is against the law. After multiple avenues to get this fixed this is my last option without taking legal action. 

Once again, please remove this invalid derogatory information from my credit file, per FTC affidavit and attached police report to avoid further escalation of this issue and breach of FCRA and FTC regulations."
Debt collection,"I recently received a copy of my credit report and I noticed that this company is reporting negative information against my SSN. I have never done business with this company. They have never provided me with any goods or services. I have no contractual obligations to this company yet they have reported to the CRA 's that I indeed do. I am requesting validation. Please send me a signed contract between me and your company. One that I signed and one you signed. Copies of a copy is not legit. I would like to see the contract with my wet ink signature, detailed statements from the last 6 months, and how this alleged debt was calculated."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX my bank account and my sons bank account were beyond wiped out by this company claiming I have a cellphone bill from XXXX for $ XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I am trying to get a refund of a Moneygram money order that was partially cashed at my bank. This is a process that I started XX/XX/18, and still not have resolved. I only received a credit for {$60.00} from a {$990.00} money order when I originally deposited this money order at my bank account with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Since I no longer have an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX, they can not credit me the remaining {$930.00} left on the money order. They say that Moneygram needs to make me whole by issuing me a refund for the remaining balance. I agree with this. 

I have made numerous calls to Moneygram customer service through XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I have also been in contact with their corporate office. On XX/XX/18, a person named XXXX from corporate told me I should expect a refund from XXXX  XXXX XXXX. I have made 4 followup calls with XXXX and left messages, and I never once got a callback. XXXX XXXX XXXX tells me they never heard from Moneygram and don't know about a refund. Moneygram has also sent me 3 letters telling me I need to go my bank branch, and have a banker call Moneygram to confirm that XXXX  XXXX XXXX did not issue me that credit. I did that twice and wasted an hour of my time and the bankers time each time. Nothing has come of it except that Moneygram says I need to do it again. On XX/XX/18, the banker even sent an email, as requested, verifying everything Moneygram asked. Followup calls to Moneygram determined that Moneygram could find no record of that email. I have a copy of that email if necessary. 

All I want is for Moneygram to refund the balance of the money order that was never credited to me. I have jumped through all their hoops, and wasted so much of my time, and still I have nothing. They have my money and will not give it back."
Debt collection,Creditor is reporting accounts that are invalid and unverified. XXXX have investigated this account and they concluded the account was not matching my records of being assigned to me. I would like proof these accounts were disputed per FCRA/ FDCPA. This is causing me anguish and its slandering my good name. Please block this account from my report so I can breathe again.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Since XX/XX/XXXX I have diligently remain consistent disputing a medical collection agency by the name of : XXXX XXXX XXXX that have made every attempt to attach me to a unverifiable account.

complaint # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Replied with an Erroneous acquisition about a phone call with attempts to resolve the debt with statements that I admitted to the debt, when the only purpose that call was initiated was to simple request validation after over a year of disputes being advised by the responses from each credit bureau to contact the funisher of this negative reporting which is what I did. 

I also contacted the original creditor for the same reason in XX/XX/XXXX and was told to contact the owner of the debt XXXX XXXX XXXX ... .so on XX/XX/XXXX I filed a second CFPB complaint on XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX CFPB replies XX/XX/XXXX that the complaint was sent to the FTC ... .Ive never heard from the complaint since that reply.

XXXX v. XXXX  XXXX XXXX , XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( S.O.N.Y. XXXX ) ( citing XXXX XXXX. XXXX ). This includes informing the debtor of his or her right to ask the collection agency to 'Validate ' the debt. 

I repeated disputed with Transunion to re-investigate the collection account only to receive that they verified the debt accurately reporting without revealing method of verification as requested. So on XX/XX/XXXX I filed a CFPB complaint # XXXX.

Student loan,"I currently owe more on my student loans than when I first borrowed for my XXXX ( back in XX/XX/XXXX and my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ). Over the years I have been forced into forbearance never informed that the interest would continue to accrue. I have specifically called and asked about repayment and forgiveness options and been given incorrect information. I called recently to follow up on Federal Repayment which I was told I would be eligible for this year. I was told I was never eligible, requested they review my phone calls from the year before which they claimed they could not find. I was told to consolidate which would have taken me 25 years to pay off with new interest when in fact if I continue paying them off the way I am now I would be done paying them off in ten years which they did not tell me. I have been a XXXX in XXXX for the last ten years and am a mother of XXXX. I am struggling to get by and live paycheck to paycheck. I was never made aware of other options than forbearance in the past and never told about forgiveness or repayment options and given false information when I asked directly. During my last conversation with Navient when I requested for them to review my phone records which they "" could not find '', I was assured I would get a statement recording my complaint filed with Navient which more than two months later has not been sent. In XX/XX/XXXX I was told to consolidate my loans to be eligible for loan forgiveness which I did and then was told that I was never eligible. This consolidation, I believe, increased my interest to the point where I now owe more than originally borrowed."
Debt collection,I've had numerous conversations with this creditor and advised that I can not receive calls at my job regarding this matter. Creditor has my personal contact information and despite me advising that i can not receive these calls they've still attempted to contact me at work as recent as today XX/XX/2019.

They said the ck. did not go through ETF so asked me to sign it so they could keep it and run it. I did this and told them to be sure they don't put it through twice on me. That is exactly what happened. On XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/2018, XXXX ran the exact same check twice. Once ETF and once manually. When this came to my atten. on my back stmt. at the end of the month, I contacted my credit union and they investigated and it was a duplicate debit to my acct. and credited the {$45.00} back to me. XXXX was paid, and the MGR. XXXX, at XXXX, XXXX, Idaho stated we didn't owe them anything. In any event. Telecheck  has put a # 3/high risk code on my checking acct. and it is impossible to now cash checks in the small town I have lived and done business in for 17 years. In the 66 years I have lived, I have NEVER written a bad check. I am now holding up lines and constantly embarrassed anywhere the Telecheck  service is used.

Please help me get this off my acct. it is making a senior citizens life miserable. Changing the checking acct. won't help either from the other complaints I am reading regarding this Telecheck  company. XXXX is no help in removing this, they don't care about their customers.

I told them that this should not have been in my name and it was done by an ex girl friend. I advised ( I think XXXX ) that I need to call him back because I was headed to work. I called back because I had some questions at XXXX and I got a hold of an XXXX ( very rude ) manager.  Started yelling as I was asking questions, I was asking for verification of the account, and anything that had my signature on it. He told me he didn't care and he was going to place it on my credit. He then told me I had a choice file an fraud affidavit or pay them {$600.00} settlement today. I said I cant make that decision today, he again started to talk over me and then just hung up the phone. 

I filled an complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX in TX that night case # XXXX. 

I called back on XX/XX/19 to speak to the original person who called me and XXXX picked up the phone, I asked him could I talk to someone else because he hung up the phone on me last time, he said he doesn't care. 

I advised I was going to file an complaint with whoever governs collection bureaus he said he doesn't care, do what I need to do. 

I need documentation that proves I even owe this account. the amount they say I owe is around 1200.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I took out a loan with XXXX in XX/XX/2013 to attend XXXX University in XXXX, IL. My parents took it out for me to help my credit score for future events in my life. The loan was only for around {$2500.00} I believe. My parents then paid off the full amount immediately after for around {$2700.00}, whatever was quoted to them. Then just a few months ago, after 5 years of hearing nothing, thinking it was long in the past, I get a report from the credit bureau that my account with XXXX was delinquent, 120 days past due and that I owed XXXX dollars in interest ... I had no clue of this for the last 5 years. 

There is no way I would leave XXXX dollars left on my loan like that. ( Apparently it had grown to XXXX from late fees ) My parents paying the {$2700.00} was an attempt to pay them off. Thats what they were quoted and paid. I feel cheated by them. And now since then I have looked into it and thats what they have done to thousands and thousands of people. Ive tried to call them and get this figured out and its impossible to get through to anyone and when you finally do its pointless. The wanted me to get online into my account to get all the information there. But I realized thats a trick of theirs as well. In the fine print you agree to things that Im sure help them get by with it. Like you agree that everything we provide is accurate and true. I didnt feel comfortable with that obviously. So I told them on the phone I wanted a copy sent to my email of the payment history and balance history. So after 24 hours I get the email and once again it says, log in to your account to view your documents you asked for. I am not going to fall for their tricks. I just want a fair report and honesty. 

Im currently in the middle of trying to refinance my home, my credit score was XXXX and it was going to drop my payments roughly 200 dollars. Now I cant. It got dropped 90 points. All of this has cost me so much time and money that I will never get back."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX, my ex-husband and I had a sun room added to our first home. The original loan documents were place with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Minnesota XXXX for approximately {$32000.00}. This loan was then bought out by Green Tree XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX , NJ XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Green Tree Mortgage merged with Ditech, which is my current lien holder. After placing several calls requesting a copy of my entire payment history, XXXX, customer service representative, advised me this request will have to be submitted via email. On XX/XX/XXXX, an attempt via email was made to obtain a copy of my payment history beginning with origination date to present, which has not been received as of date.The original loan amount was approximately {$32000.00}, with monthly payments being {$410.00}, my payment being made in XX/XX/XXXX, which I continue to pay as of present. I currently send this company {$200.00} bi-weekly which are paid through my bank via my pay. I can't seem to understand how I have paid this debt for 18 years and still have a remaining balance of {$27000.00}. I have paid off the home which was roughly {$64000.00}, paid off a brand new car which was roughly {$24000.00} since taking out this loan and still owe pretty much the same amount of monies that were initially financed. This can not be, this finance company is fraudulently taking my money by adding astronomical interest to this loan. Ditech is making false representations about amounts owed as I do not owe the above stated amount. According to the loan statement, my current interest rate is 14.999 % with only {$70.00} being place toward the principal of this loan. At this rate, this loan will never be paid off, despite already paying {$90000.00} which is triple the amount borrowed for a {$32000.00} sun room. Please assist me with getting some type of resolution and/or relief from this debt. The practices of Greentree and Ditech are unfair, unjust, unethical and predatory. As evidence of the origination amount, amount of years I have been paying on this loan and remaining balance, I am a victim of predatory lending! At conception of this loan, we were prayed upon as a young couple purchasing our first home and were deceived into predatory practices."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Curious about my credit score, I obtained a copy of my credit report. Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from US Dept of Ed, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$1200.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature to verify the debt. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately. 

Not only has no information bearing my signature ever been provided when requested, but is also Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - including but not limited to Section 611, such as : -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) Depending upon how this matter is handled, I will also be detailing any potential issues via an online public press release, including any documentation of potential small claims action."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase of over {$500.00} on my XXXX charge card ( issued through XXXX XXXX ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the balance, in full. I tried to use my charge card on XX/XX/XXXX and was unsuccessful. I was unaware that my account had been closed without my permission or any type of notice. This caused a decrease in my credit score by over 25 points. I do not carry a large outstanding balance on any of my cards, and I try to use all of them at lease once every 6 months to keep them open and active. I am trying to maintain a high credit score and low utilization rate so that I can purchase a home in the near future. This is not the first time Comenity Bank has done this to me - closing accounts with no notice. I have lost at least three accounts in this manner, thus causing credit score fluctuations and concerns. 
Through my account, online, on XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice regarding changes in the way they calculate the minimum payment due, as well as changes to their arbitration process. NO WHERE did I read that they were closing my account. 
My personal assumption is that they close these cards regularly so that it incentives customers to continuously open new accounts ( new account = discount on purchase & employee commissions ) ; this behavior can have a negative impact on one 's credit."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX, I began to repair my credit with a direct effort to secure a better FICO score. I began by paying off a loan with XXXX XXXX for {$4600.00}. I then acted to lower credit usage by paying down credit cards, lower credit utilization. I have not applied for any credit cards with exception of a XXXX XXXX late last year. If there are any inquiries on my credit report they should be deleted because they are not at my request. XXXX XXXX   reported the {$4600.00} as paid off on XX/XX/XXXX. For the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX my FICO score was XXXX. XXXX XXXX provided FICO score each month included in my monthly statement. When I inquired on my XX/XX/XXXX FICO score, I learned that it had only advanced 5 points to XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX quite irate and they informed me that this score was provided by TRANSUNION. I spoke with TRANSUNION and they specifically stated that they could help if I made a payment to a subscription to XXXX. I was then directed to FICO where it was almost impossible to speak with a live agent. Being certified in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I knew that my score rightfully should have been in the 700 plus range. I asked FICO to make the correction, the response was they would assist if I purchased a subscription. This is certainly consumer fraud and I request that my score be corrected."

Student loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX I refinanced my student loan debt with Navient ; at first the total payment each month was reasonable. However, after updating my account ~ 6 months after my loan closed to add direct debit, they increased my interest rate. At the time, I was very young and despite multiple calls to refute the increase citing that the only thing that changed was adding a direct debit which was, in fact, a bonus for them, they refused to change the rate. Now, ~10 years later, after actively reading up on on predatory practices performed by these vendors I realize I was a victim. My goal in reporting this complaint is simple - I want the original rate honored and the over payment Navient has received in error to be applied to my account. I am lucky enough to be able to pay for my loans each month ; I am disputing that. However, I grew up in extreme poverty and loan debt was the only way for me to achieve my college dreams. I had no financial support and no guidance and was taken advantage of by this company. Now as an adult, I am outraged. In the grand scheme of things my issue is not as egregious as some cases I have read about, but it was unethical and predatory and should be addressed. 
I currently owe {$30000.00} on a {$50000.00} loan -- they have received over $ 20K in principle to date. I have been paying on the loan since XX/XX/XXXX. I did take a grievance period in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX due to a high expense for dental work that I could not afford and was not covered by insurance due to the problems typically being addressed in adolescence.

After not receiving the cards and my transactions being declined at a charge for declining it was determined the lady that sold me the card put in the wrong zip code. I asked they resend a card since I never rec 'd the personalized card in the mail. I never rec 'd any cards in the mail. I went to the store, Check Into Cash in XXXX CA and asked that they give me a new unexpired card, transfer my funds since the card was expired and I could no longer have access to my money.

After ( 1 ) month of making ( 4 ) weekly payments, I received another charge from XXXX XXXX of {$190.00} that was charged on my BOA credit card again. 

- I reached out to XXXX XXXX via email - who told me that the {$190.00} was charged because I failed to cancel the service before ( 30 ) days. I explained to XXXX XXXX that I assumed that I was purchasing an individual product and not a subscription service ( as the company offers both of these, but the individual product does not expire and the subscription service does ). The company sent me back a lengthy and clear listing of their terms and conditions, which clearly showed me that the product that I purchased was a subscription service, and if I did not cancel within ( 30 ) days a monthly charge of {$190.00} would apply. 

- However, these clear and concise terms that XXXX XXXX provided me, was very inconspicuous on the email ads that was used to entice me to purchase the service. Specifically, XXXX XXXX used a browsewrap having only a hyperlink disclaimer that was located way below the ordering link, in which there was no reason for me to continue to scroll down to see it. Legally, this type of unreasonably difficult to locate terms and conditions is not valid, binding, nor can it be enforced. 

- On XX/XX/2018 I disputed the charges with BOA ( 4 ) {$140.00} charges as the service was not even working while I attempted to use it and overall I was completely dissatisfied with the service because it was not what was offered to me and I also disputed the {$190.00} charge as this was not even authorized. These charges were reversed and was I provided a credit by BOA, I received a letter from BOA days letter explaining that the dispute was under investigation, and I may need to provide evidence if the merchant disagreed. Shortly after, the charges were applied back to my account.

- However, BOA failed to send me a written explanation as described by the fair credit billing act. I only became aware of this by calling to make a payment on my account which was much longer than the 10 days that the investigation was convened. I still reached out to BOA after finding these unbeknownst charges being reapplied to my account, but because the investigation ended more than 10 days, BOA denied even reading or reopening my dispute case."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX in regard to my student loans they service. My complaint was that the amounts that I am being billed for are not the amounts that were sent to the University I attended. The amounts that I am being billed for are higher than the amounts that I borrowed. Because the amounts are higher, I am paying more interest on these incorrect amounts. I mailed XXXX a certified letter to look into this problem and correct the inaccuracies. I received a letter back explaining how XXXX calculates interest. They also sent a copy of my promissory note. They did not research or correct my complaint. I then sent three more certified letters XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX asking for them to research and correct the errors. Again, each time they responded with a letter explaining how the interest is calculated. I have attached a ledger from each institution I attended and how much my student loan was for. I have also attached the ledger of what XXXX is billing me for. On each disbursement that XXXX is billing me for, the amount is more than what was borrowed. I have also attached the certified tracking numbers from the United States Postal Service showing where XXXX received my correspondence. XXXX also is billing me different fees that I never agreed upon paying. I requested the contract that indicated I would be responsible for these fees and XXXX has yet to provide the contract and the notification that these fees would be charged. Another issue that I have with Navient is that they have no record of my loan history from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX but I am being billed for these years. XXXX has violated both the Fair Credit Reporting Act by reporting inaccurate information to the three credit bureaus ; they have also violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act by seeking collection of an unjustified amount and by not providing validation of the debt in the amounts they claim is owed."

The law clearly states from "" date of adjudication '' or date of "" order of relief ''. 

Any case, civil or otherwise, which is dismissed no longer exists in the eye of the law and a case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. Therefore, you have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed nonexistent. 
Therefore, pursuant to Section 1681 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the FCRA, you must delete this information from my credit report and send me an updated copy when this action is completed.

Mortgage,"RE : XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL-XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX + XXXX, tax parcel # XXXX Dear Sir or Madam, I have purchased a lot at the above address in XXXX. I had planned to build a house and move there with my wife upon our retirement. However, XXXX XXXX refused to advance payments against the mortgage for the construction. XXXX bought this loan from XXXX, out of bankcruptcy. 

We had originally taken out a construction to permanent loan with the now defunct XXXX. The loan was saddled with very high fees and closing costs. Also, the interest rate was initially high at 7 %, despite my, at that time, very high credit rating. XXXX issued payments to the mortgage broker ( commissions ), the real estate agent who sold us the lot as well as an initial draw to the original contractor that was supposed to build the house. Those draws were issued against my loan with nothing in return to me, resulting in a much higher balance than if I had just bought the lot. The contractor never did any construction but pocketed the money advanced to him by XXXX. 

After XXXX went bankrupt in XXXX, XXXX Bank purchased the loan for XXXX cents on the dollar. Even though this was a construction to permanent loan, XXXX XXXX refused to pay for the construction of the house. At that point, I had already paid out several XXXX dollars out of pocket to the contractor for site preparation. So I got stuck with the sunk cost of not only XXXX of dollars in unnecessary loan costs, but also the sunk cost of the site preparation. 

Even though XXXX Bank reduced the interest on the loan, they have collected more in interest on this loan than what they had originally paid for the entire loan. Over the past 10 years, I had asked XXXX XXXX three times to reduce the outstanding principal or to take the property back ( deed in lieu ), but they had always refused. 

I am XXXX XXXX old and my wife and I only receive Social Security income and a few XXXX dollars in rental income per month. Our out of pocket medical expenses are mounting and in order to continue making payments on the above-mentioned loan, we will soon be forced to sell our home. 


Sincerely, XXXX XXXX"

I made several payments totaling {$930.00} which was more than the amount we loaned to me. In XXXX, I had some financial and health issues come up and I couldnt make my payments. Not knowing what the online lender could do I contacted the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions and the Indiana Secretary of State, both of which informed me that XXXX wasnt licensed in the state of Indiana, theyre tribal leaders and charged illegal rates of interest. They advised me that the loans were illegal thus making them null, void and uncollectable. Upon receiving this information I contacted XXXX via phone and told the what I was told. After that conversation I still received emails from them trying to collect money from me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an alert from my credit monitoring app that a collection account was added. The account was reported by - Complete Credit Solutions , Inc . 
In regards to the XXXX account. After making several phone calls I was told that XXXX sold my account to this company. I contacted XXXX and once again advised them that the loan was illegal thus making it null, void and uncollectableband that they needed to pull back my account from the collection agency. They said they a case manger would look into it. I wasnt given any time or even the persons name. I then contacted Complete credit solutions- who were very rude and basically said that they have money on this account and I needed to pay. I advised them that the loan was null, void and uncollectable but they insisted that this legal for them to report this to the credit bureau. I have since then filed a dispute within the credit bureau XXXX.

Mortgage,"I received a credit alert via e-mail at XXXX pm CST via my XXXX Protect My ID program. I logged in and saw that BMO was reporting my account delinquent. I called XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX  to inquire about it, but that phone kept asking for my phone number and PIN but never led to an actual person. I then called XXXX and ended up talking to XXXX. 

He explained the XX/XX/XXXX payment was not received. Told him I sent it. He said because it was not a full payment, it was not applied. Paul admitted BMO has my mortgage payment, but BMO is refusing to apply it. During the conversation I learned my monthly payment had increased and that BMO never notified me of this. XXXX said BMO mailed me 2 notices, but when I asked him to give me the dates of the notices, he said he didn't have access to that. We went back and forth about the notices, he claiming I had received them but never producing any actual proof I had. I asked him to tell me what address BMO had sent the notices to, but he was unable to tell me either.

We were not getting anywhere, so I asked to speak to his supervisor. He put me on hold and told me his manager, XXXX, was on the phone with someone else and to give him a number XXXX could call me at. 

After my phone call with XXXX ended, I started looking at the statements online, my preferences and my paper files to try to better understand what was going on. The last paper statement I have from BMO was the one dated XX/XX/XXXX. The last escrow analysis I received from them via mail was dated XX/XX/XXXX for changes effective XX/XX/XXXX. Every year, once I receive that, I make changes to my monthly payment. However, I did not receive any escrow analysis in the mail for changes effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then turned my electronic version of my account with BMO. I went to the paperless statement setting to see if I could find any answers, but BMO tells me that I "" don't have eligible accounts for paperless statements. '' I then checked the settings for security alerts and notifications and alerts, BMO has my current e-mail and phone numbers but never sent me an e-mail or a text about the change if payment and the so-called delinquency. I don't even get notices from BMO that a monthly statement is available.

It was a {$500.00} loan, which was not scheduled to be paid in full until next year. I was in the process of buying a house and my lender advised me to pay this loan off. I paid it off in XXXX. On my credit report it was reporting every payment on time since i got the loan. Every time i called for questions i was never made aware i had a missing payment. Once i paid off the loan they backdated everything and THEN reported me as 30 days late. This caused me to be denied for a loan due to a recent 30 day late. I am wanting this removed as no representative made me aware i was 30 days behind the entire time of the loan. And i feel this is extremely poor business practice. You can see that every payment was made afterwards. Had i known this i would have made the payment. I attempted to speak to Moneylion about this and i get the run around saying to contact the credit bureaus. But i already disputed it and they will not fix it. If this can be fixed i can buy a house. At the time the way it is showing i will need to wait a year from the late payment to buy a home and this is highly unfair. Why would they report me being on time the entire time but THEN report me late AFTER i paid the loan off ... ... ... .. this seems highly fishy ... ... ... ... Please help."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX and returned the lease on XX/XX/2019 which is 4 days prior to the lease end date. Toyota Financial claims I kept the car two months past the lease end date without paying for the vehicle although I have proof from the dealer which received the car back in XXXX. I never received any invoices for this supposed late return. As a result of their mistake they have ruined my credit and my credit score has dropped by 72 points. I have been trying for the last month to resolve this issue with Toyota Financial and the three main credit Bureaus. Toyota is now admitting they made a mistake but have yet to inform the credit Bureaus. Every time I call Toyota I spend 15-25 minutes on hold and once connected I get a representative that can barely speak english and keeps reading a script. I am no longer willing to tolerate this, my credit score went from 805 to 733 for a mistake Toyota has made and keeps promising to resolve for the past month."
Mortgage,Wells Fargo is in breach of our mortgage contract. They are withholding more in our escrow account then what is clearly agreed upon. They flat out refuse to explain why. I have tried to get a explanation out of them but all they do is deflect and double talk every time I ask a direct question about why they are with holding more then what is required. This is typical for this company. They have a bad reputation and I feel uneasy dealing with them.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX account # XXXX. I received a notice from XXXX XXXX stating that this account was pas due. I knew I didn't have an open account with XXXX  so I cent a certified letter to them which they received asking for information on the account because i didn't have an account with them. I never received anything further from XXXX. I received an alert from a credit monitioring site stating that an account on my credit was just marke as 30 days late. I called XXXX   and they told me that I had a Streamline account and that the yearly fee had been assesed. I informed XXXX that I no longer had a Streamline account with them and this account was closed months prior if not a year. I don't even have a checking/savings/or loan account with XXXX  anymore so I asked her how was it possible to have a fee assessed on a closed account. This streamline account was one that I was approved for {$500.00} that I could barrow money from the account and make monthly payments until the barrowed amount was paid back. XXXX  closed this account long before I left the bank totally. The account was in good standing and had been closed and updated on my credit file for several months to a year. I do not understand how this bank could charge a {$25.00} fee on a closed account that they closed and how could they add a 30 day late to an account that was closed but in good standings. How would I pay a yearly fee on an account that was closed, one that I didn't even have access to because it was closed and I don't bank with XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. The person I spoke with at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stated the account wasn't properly closed which I don't understand wither because it was closed long before this happened and it showed on my credit report which I can provide to show that it was closed. I then proceded to ask the lady from XXXX  ok, clearly this was a mistake on XXXX part so how do I rectify this incorrect information on my credit report that you all reported and she told me that she could send a note to her lead but this was something that I would have to take care of by disputing with the credit bureaus. Why could it be so easy to report incorrect information but not go back to update the credit bureaus with the correct information? This account was never late as it had been closed and in good standing. She removed the charges fromt the closed account said that she believed it wasn't properly closed which I don't believe is true because I showed on the XXXX  account that it was closed and it showe on the credit report that it was closed. Waking up to a 51 point drop in a credit score because of a mistake by XXXX  is not fair and then the XXXX  rep acted as if she didn't care. I have disputed this with Equifax and XXXX and it's not on XXXX and the account is as it should be on XXXX  ( in good standings ). I have attached Pictures from my credit report to show that this account was closed as XXXX  closed it OVER a year ago. They late was added the end of XX/XX/XXXX or first of XX/XX/XXXX."
Debt collection,"I received a garnishment letter from my job stating that wages were being taken for LVNV FUNDING LLC, for credit card debt.

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a wire to XXXX XXXX in XXXX TX who did not honor our agreement despite multiple attempts to fix the issue. 

Therefore, in XXXX, I disputed the item with JP Morgan Chase. They issued a temporary credit and I thought that was the end of it because I doubted XXXX would rectify it through them either. 

However, Chase is now refusing to honor the chargeback because despite using a debit card, I had wired the money. Their ridiculous claim is that since XXXX XXXX processed the money, it was against them and that it was verified. I specifically advised that the money was a payment for a service not rendered. They don't care about that. I would appreciate someone remind the bank that it is a chargeback for services not rendered and therefore, my chargeback should not be reversed and that they should fight with XXXX XXXX where XXXX has his fraudulent assets."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The co-owner of an auto loan with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy which was granted XX/XX/XXXX. I, the party that did NOT file bankruptcy, continued making payments for several years with no default whatsoever before, during, or after the bankruptcy of the other party. No negative information transpired to my credit report throughout the life of the loan until I paid off the vehicle. I made my regular payment in XX/XX/XXXX, and on XX/XX/XXXX called and paid off the remaining balance. I then get a notification that my FICO score dropped from XXXX  to XXXX which is how I found out that XXXX incorrectly charged the account off and report as XX/XX/XXXX being a serious delinquent payment. I have tried numerous times calling and they have advised that the account is protected under bankruptcy law and this is the way it is. They have dragged me down as if I was the one that filed bankruptcy and as if they never received payment for any of the months. They never sent me any statements or mail regarding the account. I could not see my transaction history online and had to call and request it. With that being said, they sent me one transaction history which was then revised after the dispute and I was sent a second ""CORRECTED"" transaction history of the loan."
Mortgage,"on XX/XX/2019, an attorney that represented Midland Mortgage was send to tell me that the bank was filing a foreclosure on my resident. I reached out to the bank to apply for a repayment plan. I emailed and faxed to midland mortgage my application. I reach out to the a week later, they said they never received my application. so i send it again. For two weeks, I have been reaching out to them. I have spoken to 10 plus representative and a manager they claim was a lost mitigation manager and he was a collection person. I have not spoke to ANYONE from LOST MITIGATION. Every time I tried to talked to that department, Midland Reps. stated "" they can't be reach or there's no way of calling them ''. 
On XX/XX/2019, XXXX bank wanted a quit claim from me which I email and faxed to them on XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/XXXX, i called and they said I was denied for a repayment plain because my net income was not high enough which I found was weird cause during the same week they asked me for a divorce decree. My net income is {$7100.00}. I spoke to a manager and he told me to send {$6000.00} in and see if they would put the {$5000.00} attorney fees toward the back end and send in my child support doc.. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to another rep. who said that they need a letter from Massachusetts saying I was getting child support. I am so confused on how they can denied a claim in 2 days and no one single person from lost mitigation representative is assign to it where I can talk to them instead of 10 plus people from different dept. etc. customer service and collection but I have not spoken to Anyone from lost mitigation. I have called every other day and spoken to so many people that is not from that department who have given me no answers to question I ask or wrong answer. I would like to have the CFPB help me find a solution with this mortgage company since I feel they are not even working on it and just denying a chance for a repayment since I only owe {$11000.00} which part of that is attorneys fee. I can make a {$6000.00} payment on tuesday XX/XX/19."
Debt collection,"I recieved a notice in the mail that Cascade Capital LLC. has sold an account that is in my name, to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I never recieved a letter stating that the account held in my name, was being sold. 
I have asked XXXX XXXX XXXX to VALIDATE the information. They said that the will reach out to the ORIGINAL CREDITOR. All I recieved was an itemized statement at the beginning. I then asked them to validate, I have recieved another statement but this one seems to have some medical procedures on on it. 
I have called XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke to a person named, XXXX, asked them if they have the HIPPA Realease Form to share this information to a 3rd party. XXXX stated that they are still acquiring that information from Cascade Capital LLC. 
I feel like my HIPPA laws may have been violated and if they have the correct paper work, I should be provided with proof. 
I will attach the files/statement that was sent to me by XXXX XXXX XXXX that they recieved from Cascade Capital LLC. but I will cover up the area were it seems that medical procedures were done for caution."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","on XX/XX/XXXX I made a payment arrangement to get my credit back in good standing with XXXX XXXX, on a chat with an agent named XXXX XXXX, we created a payment plan and expectation that they would start reporting my payments if they were made on time per the arrangement, my first payment I made was that day XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX $ my second one was due XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX $ and the next was XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  $ - I made the second payment thinking it was the XXXX $ and realized I needed to make more of a payment so I tried to add money, they wouldn't accept it, so I called and spoke to several people about why they wont accept MORE money, after having to hang up on one person and calling back I finally got someone who deleted the first payment then took the correct amount, I then paid XXXX $ XX/XX/XXXX to get my account back in complete good standing. With all this being said I did all this to get my credit back in good standing so they were to report it, because I was moving and needed to get a credit check, I then find out XX/XX/XXXX that they reported me as not making a payment in XX/XX/XXXX and haven't reported ANY of my current payments - I called them and spoke to several people who said they have to follow the fair credit reporting standards etc etc however the agent I spoke to, XX/XX/XXXX said they dont have to report me as making payments and positive until I am in good standing, but yet that doesn't seem correct because I have made payments and you are reporting me as XX/XX/XXXX NOT making a payment then XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX you have no payments at all reflected, I can understand XX/XX/XXXX but NOT XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They won't fix my score until after my next billing cycle she said. So now I am unable to move because my credit is showing this and also they are violating my rights as a consumer - I am looking into legal action in small claims against them for this inaccuracy and the issues it is causing currently."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I am in process of purchasing house, currently under contract and was planned for closing on XX/XX/XXXX. I was estimating approximately XXXX to XXXX USD in closing amount that was supposed to be due on closing day. However, I received email on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and XXXX from "" XXXX '' to wire transfer the amount prior to closing to allow closing process smoothly. I could not recognize it to be phishing attempt initially as I was using my cell phone to check emails and email address was named exactly same as the contact person from title company. I completed the wire with amount of {$93000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and called my title company to confirm if they received the amount, only to figure out it was a scam. I have submitted fraud inquiry with both my bank XXXX and recipient 's bank Wells Fargo and it is under process but have not received back my funds yet. 

Upon contacting my bank XXXX, they state they have requested wire return request to Wells Fargo and we have to wait for them to return wire. Upon contacting Wells Fargo, they suggest I report to proper law agency for them to process the return of wire, which I have completed by reporting to IC3, but still have not received any reply on return of the funds."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Since 2008, I have kept very close monitoring of my credit ; however, in the past several years I have requested annually "" free '' credit reports AND scores, but have NEVER received any score from any of the three agencies. When requesting both, there is a box to check for both, but when the report is received it literally says, No Score is included with no information on how to obtain that "" free '' score without having to '' jump through more hoops '' and sign up to pay for it on another website. 

When calling the three agencies, I have been put on hold for more than 30 minutes to an hour and have NEVER received an answer or a response as to why I can not get my credit score as well as my report. The most notorious of the three reporting agencies is XXXX. You must sign up on line and pay for your score. 

Withholding a consumers financial history, in my opinion is equivalent to withholding critical medical information from a consumer that can assist them in improving their health. Consumers lacking easy access to their personal financial evaluations ; e.g. scores and reports does NOT allow them to negotiate effectively with lenders, but more importantly benefit from lower interest rates etc. they have worked so hard to EARN! I maintain excellent credit ; however, anytime I have applied for a loan of any kind, the lender has ALWAYS had a "" lower '' score than I was aware of which they use to increase my interest rates and thus costing me hundreds of thousands of dollars over the years! 

What is the point of withholding or making it nearly impossible for a consumer to obtain credit scores AND reports, but to give lenders and corporate entities a financial advantage over the consumer? If consumers are allowed BY LAW to have these reports annually, the three major reporting agencies should be abiding by these laws and not continuing to put barriers in the way of consumers obtaining critical financial information. And, if found in violation, these three agencies should return the hundreds of thousands of dollars lost to consumers since the receipt of a free annual free credit report and scores to consumers was signed into law."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received a prepaid credit card issued by Bank of America for an overpayment for services with XXXX XXXX. With the card was a notice that I could call and receive a check, which I did. I received the check in early XX/XX/XXXX the day before I left on a trip. I put the check away for safety and forgot about it until the XX/XX/2018. When I found the check it had a "" void after 120 days '' on it and I was not able to get out to cash it so I called customer service to request a new check on # XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they would issue a stop pay and send a new check .I have been getting the same story 2 times a month and still no check .I called another customer service number to elevate my claim and was told yesterday that they received an e-mail stating that the original check had cleared the bank .I still have the check and Iverified the number with them and it is the same."

Debt collection,"left vm on XX/XX/19 at XXXX to call Balanced Health at XXXX. Then called again from phone # XXXX at XXXX, then phoned again at XXXX from phone # XXXX. I have never received any mail correspondence from these people and when I asked for it today I was hung up on."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I logged online to check my XXXX Card ( issued by XXXX XXXX   ) account prior to ordered a sample backsplash tile to update my kitchen. Upon checking my account balance, I was startled to learn that my available credit was {$19.00}. I was surprised because I knew I should have had more than {$300.00} in available credit, with a balance of {$370.00}, which put my utilization at a little more than 50 %. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email ( and a few days later, a posted letter ) alerting me that my credit line had been increased. Only after that did I make another purchase of a little less than {$100.00}. I have done nothing but pay my bill on time every month, and I usually pay a little more than my minimum payment each month. I called tonight, XX/XX/XXXX, and was told that the bank must have received information that made it lower my credit line increase. While on hold to speak with a supervisor, I checked my credit score and learned that my score was updated just today and has been steadily rising. In fact, with XXXX now dropping my credit line, my credit utilization has sharply risen to 90+ %, which will definitely have a negative impact on my credit. 

My issue here is that with an offer of an increased credit limit, my use should have been acceptance of the offer. Therefore, their reneging on the terms seems less-than-honest, especially for a customer who has consistently paid on time, and this will have a supremely negative impact on my credit report in a way I had no control over happening. Additionally, while I understand from speaking with the supervisor tonight that a letter has been mailed, it is a poor policy to drastically reduce a credit line without so much of an email saying that something changed on my account, allowing their customer to be shell-shocked by a suddenly-increased credit utilization on their account. I am disappointed in this company, and I am seriously considering whether I want to continue doing business with this company. While my {$390.00} may not be significant to XXXX, it is significant to me, and I will make sure everyone I know is aware of the shady practices this company displays to faithful customers who pay on time and never exceed their limit."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2018 ( and XX/XX/XXXX ) I was sent 2 payments ( {$690.00} each ) by the Social Security via direct deposit to my Chase checking account ( XXXXXXX ). Unfortunately, the attendant wrote down the account number incorrectly. After not seeing the deposits in my bank statement, I called the SS and they acknowledged that two payments were transferred to Chase. Next, I called Chase customer support and they responded that they dont have any knowledge about transfers from the SS.

Caught in a limbo, I decided to drive to the SS offices in XXXX, to speak directly with the attendant. Following another verification of my data, it was revealed that the account number was incorrect, and we corrected it. At that point I asked to mail the following checks to my home address ( not to the bank ). These payments arrived on time, as expected. 
By the end of XXXX, after repeated calls to Chase customer support, I was advised to call the claims department ( a number not published on the website ) and filled for an inquiry, explaining that the account number used by the SS was incorrect. They said theyll investigate that, yet never got back to me. 
A new visit to the SS offices revealed that one of the two checks bounced back to the US treasury, while the fate of the second check remained a mystery. In XXXX, I called the Chase claims department again and filed a new inquiry. Two days later, they got back, telling me that the check had been deposited into another account and the claims department has completed their instigation (??? ) Unsatisfied with this answer, I asked how could I retrieve my money. They advised that the only way was to go to my branch and authenticate myself. I did so and after the clerk tried repeatedly to find ways to retrieve the deposit, she told me that she is incapable of performing it. 
A new call to the claims department ( once again explaining the whole saga ) didnt help. I asked to speak to the supervisor who responded : why did you wait all this time? and that nothing further could be done. 
My questions : 1 ) Why was one check sent back to the treasury while the other ( with a similar wrong account number ) was deposited into a different account? 
2 ) Beyond the flawed customer support we have no knowledge of any direct deposits from SS on XX/XX/2018, the Chase claims department concluded their investigation. What does it mean for the customer? It is the bank responsibility to retrieve that money! 
3 ) After such a long time, Chase needs to refund my money immediately. It is inconceivable that there are no ways of recovering it."
Debt collection,A collector named XXXX from a company called XXXX contacted me on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. I told him I was at work and he could call me back after XXXX. He said no to that and told me he was going to take legal action against me. After he spoke to me he called my mother on her cell phone and at her work. I have never given any company my mothers work phone number. He told her that they were going to file legal action against me. I called him back on XX/XX/2019 at the phone number he called from XXXX. He said he had called a great many people about my account. When I tried to speak to him about this matter he hung up on me. He would not give me the name of the company he was calling from. He did tell me on the XXXX that he was collecting on my XXXX account. I had to call and speak to XXXX to find out who they sold the debt to. I then tried to call XXXX at the number XXXX gave me XXXX. I was put on hold after I told them that I thought their collection policies were illegal. They then hung up on me. I have now sent them a cease and desist order and a letter.

I know this because I've had {$11000.00} forgiven in XX/XX/XXXX from my student loan balance of {$15000.00}. 
Currently, I have {$4400.00} left in 2 loans according to my XXXX account. My guarantor for these 2 loans are the state of Texas which is now Trellis Company. Trellis Company continues to create difficulties for my application in order to get the {$4500.00} forgiven. I have applied seven times. Five out of the seven times, I was told that the documents were not legible. I was told that in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and now again XXXX. The first time I applied was XX/XX/XXXX at the end of my 5 year. 
My last submission on XX/XX/XXXX, I made sure to clearly type the application and have the appropriate signatures done neatly by both myself and previous administrators. I was denied because I was told the application was "" too light '' and that they could not confirm that XXXX  XXXX  still works at the XXXX XXXX ( which he does ). No phone calls were made to the XXXX  to verify his employment nor were there any contacts made to him directly. Now I am being asked to show his employment verification of his position which I am not allowed to request through my HR department. 
The first 6 times I applied, there was no mention about my previous XXXX 's status being a reason for denying my application. Now with my most recent denial, I'm being asked to do something that is not within my boundaries. For the past 8 months, I've made multiple phone calls ( at least twice a month ) to XXXX to verify the status of my application, I've submitted all the paper work every time, and everything is up to date. Because I have gotten loans forgiven for a my first application, I know my application is solid. 
I've been informed by XXXX, loan service provider, that my guarantor ( Trellis Company ) keep denying my application for the following reasons : 1- Illegibility 2- ""  Too light '' 3- Updated information 4- XXXX XXXX verification of work ( without making any contact with the XXXX  or person ) From the feedback that I am receiving, I am under the impression that Trellis refuses to forgive my loans and keep making me do the run-around until I give up and pay for my loans out of pocket. I have no issues with XXXX, since they have provided me with all the information I need. My problem is with Trellis Company."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX//19, I posted on XXXX looking to buy tickets for a concert in XXXX, TX. I received a direct message from XXXX user @ XXXX saying he had tickets and to name a price. I offered him {$40.00} USD and he accepted. I initially asked if he had XXXX but he said no, and told me to send the payment through PayPal instead. I sent {$40.00} USD to XXXX and since the payment was not instant, he asked me to send the payment again. I asked for a refund of my original transaction and a screenshot for proof. He provided the screenshot of the processing refund and said it would be available in 1-3 business days. 

When I tried to send {$40.00} USD a second time, the PayPal website started glitching so he told me to use the mobile app instead. I downloaded the app and when I went to start the second transaction, PayPal informed me that the recipient would be receiving the payment in XXXX XXXX dollar ( NZD ) which is suspicious considering the concert I plan to attend is in the United States. I told him I was no longer comfortable making the transaction to which he responded : "" oh its because my paypals a business paypal lol i have a lot of currencies on it ''. I told him that this was sketchy and I was no longer interested, and he proceeded to block me on XXXX."

I know this cant be right because like I said I never had an account with this company. I want this company to provide me with the original contract that has my signature on it that proves that I opened this account and also to provide me with any type of agreement between me and this company that says I have an obligation to pay them. The FCRA says that a creditor must provide the consumer with original documentation bearing the signature that validates the account. I want the original contract bearing my signature, and if the original contract bearing my signature cant be provided I want this collection deleted from any of the credit reporting agencies that is being reported to. I wont accept any copies of statements or an itemized piece of paper for validation of this account because that is not enough to validate it."

Vehicle loan or lease,"I cosigned for a car XX/XX/XXXX from Santander Consumer USA. I found out the person who I cosigned the car for wasn't paying the note so I put the car up for voluntary repossession approximately XX/XX/XXXX. The person ended up skipping town with the car and on XX/XX/XXXX he was arrested for XXXX XXXX XXXX in New Mexico. The crime happened in XXXX, Arizona so the car and the young man were transferred there.  The car was involved in the crime thats why they took the car as well. I've been in constant contact with Santander to try and get this issue resolved. I've also been in contact with the XXXX  County police department in regards to the car. They had told me they couldn't release the car until the trial was over. The trial ended sometime in XX/XX/XXXX and I was able to get the location of the car and a case number for Santander to pick it up. I also spoke with the detective who has been waiting for Santander to pick it up. During these past few years Santander has not sent me any mail regarding the car, no bills nothing. Ive had someone work on my credit and Santander was supposed to send a letter back within thirty days and I never got anything from them. I get no type of communication from them. I called Santander today just to get my account number. They explained to me they have been trying to get in touch with the officer who has the car and that they had been calling him when I asked when they called they hung up on me ( XX/XX/XXXX). I I had told them once they get the car back we could work out something because im trying to buy a home and this is the only thing stopping me. in the year XX/XX/XXXX they reported me late on this car payment three times which makes no sense because it hasnt been paid at all. It should be late 12 months. Im trying my hardest with them but I never get anywhere. They dont seem to want to pick up the car and they dont seem to want to communicate with me about it.  The situation is pretty unfair and im trying to resolve it but i keep coming up short with these people.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a public record & XXXX XXXX entry that was placed on my credit report and I have been trying for over 12 months to get this entry removed. I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how Equifax, XXXX and XXXX verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. 
Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call Equifax back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All 3 major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine."

Student loan,"So, I'm trying to go debt-free and I've been making "" overpayments '' toward the principle of my loans here and there over the last couple of years. Or, I thought I was anyway. I got frustrated because it seemed like my loan principle wasn't getting any smaller and I was right, it wasn't! I went looking for why and it turns out Navient applied all of my extra payments to the interest instead of my principle! They're sneaky about it too, when you make extra payments via the online dashboard, they call it an "" overpayment '' but they don't let you specify where you want the money to go. I figured since it was an overpayment, it would go onto my principle ( since they don't have the option to specify ). NOPE! Not only were they stealing my overpayments, but they also have not been reporting my payments to the credit bureaus. 

I tried to find my monthly statements ( which they all but hide from you ) because I coud n't see a breakdown of my accrued charges on my dashboard. When I finally found my monthly statements, they're hard to interpret. Utterly ridiculous."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I HAVE REVIEWED MY CREDIT REPORT AND FOUND SOME INACCURATE ACCOUNTS AND ENTRIES IDENTIFIED AS INQUIRIES THAT WAS PLACED ON MY CREDIT WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. THESE NEGATIVE ACCOUNTS AND INQUIRIES HAVE CAUSED A GREAT DEED OF HARDSHIP ON MY CREDIT. IT IS SO UNFAIR TO ME BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE OF SOMEONE ELSE 'S SELFISH WAYS AND I HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE BUT TO SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES.

I'M ASKING THAT YOU PLEASE RE-INVESTIGATE THE ACCOUNTS AND INQUIRIES AND HAVE THEM REMOVED OFF MY CREDIT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE ACCOUNTS AND INQUIRIES DOES NOT RELATE TO ANY TRANSACTIONS MADE BY ME.
Mortgage,"I had just closed on a mortgage for my primary residence with Union Bank at the end of XXXX / beginning of XXXX and started working with them for a refinance transaction for an investment property on XX/XX/XXXX. I was quoted by XXXX XXXX over email that closing costs would be roughly 4k  on on $ XXXX 75 % = {$150000.00}, PI {$760.00} 3.875 % 1.250 pts. 
I asked XXXX and his assistant XXXX to proceed with the transaction. 
XXXX responded on XX/XX/XXXX with this : "" Ok, I will forward a online app invite to you, the same you filled out for your purchase. Its easy. '' I filled out the application and proceeded to provide all required documents to XXXX and XXXX. 


On XX/XX/XXXX I received a loan estimate that showed the closing cost of {$7300.00} instead of ~ {$4000.00} that was quoted to me. This is all documented in email. XXXX said that was a misquote and he will work with management to get a rate exception While the issue with the rate was going on, I was told that the appraisal has been ordered ... and I was contacted by the appraiser who completed the appraisal in XXXX. 
As I was getting worried that the transaction is not proceeding as per normal i kept asking XXXX about progress and was always reassured that its proceeding per usual and that refinances are just taking a long time at the bank right now. 
But in the middle of XXXX i was told by XXXX that my application was cancelled since I did not pay the application fees. NO ONE EVER ASKED ME FOR AN APPLICATION FEES. 
At this point, XXXX said we need to re-start the process. XXXX called and collected {$550.00} application fees and my loan was submitted for underwriting around XX/XX/XXXX and a new appraisal was ordered. 
After getting the run around from underwriting for a month and still no progress till XXXX, i decided to go with XXXX  XXXX  for this transaction. 
I am asking for action to be taken against Union Bank and for my {$550.00} application fees to be refunded in full"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","A delinquent notice was put on my credit report from this company saying for {$20000.00}. I never did make a contract or apply for this loan. I'm tried to talk to the company. They said everything for applying was all electronic and they have no proof that I took out a loan with them except for some of my information which anybody could obtain and use they have no physical proof. I believe someone fraudulently used my information to take a loan from this company.They said they sent it to a bank account I do not have. They asked me to file a complaint so they could investigate. 

The account is with XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX and was sent to XXXX XXXX for collection. They only gave me last XXXX digits of account number XXXX. I have called and asked for verification and documentation showing that I took out a loan from them and they can not provided because everything was done electronically. They claim the loan was issued in XX/XX/2018. Which I was in XXXX at the time. I have not made a contract or signed an agreement to take out a loan or account with this company. I would please like it removed from my credit report and deleted as fraudulent or inaccurate."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Years ago my wallet was stolen out of my car. I went ahead and reported the incident to the police and took all the necessary steps to protect myself. However, whoever stole my wallet, has been using my information to open up fraudulent accounts under my name. I have been fighting these fraudulent accounts for months now and have been able to clean out the most of them. There is still a XXXX XXXX card on my Transunion report that will not be removed, even though the account has been proven to not belong to me."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I am selfemployed. I had a capital one card for 10 or 12 years. I started using it for my business and I paid it off every month. I had to call after a few years of use because I seen where they had a points thing and I had been missing out for years on thousands of points. That was a little aggravating. You would have thought that them knowing what I was using it for they would have recommended it. Anyways. I messed my credit up when I was young and had finally worked really hard to fix all that. I was getting increases as my business got bigger and bigger. That was awesome. In XXXX the called and asked if I would be interested in getting an insurance that was XXXX on every {$100.00} dollars at the end of the month. Sounds like a good idea so I got it. After a while I forgot I even had it. In XXXX I got into a bind and didnt get payed on a couple of jobs and I was left with over {$10000.00} dollars owed. I forgot I had been paying that insurance all those years and I couldnt make the payments. When I did remember bout it I contacted them and they said it had gone out just a few months after I got it and had only paid like {$9.00} dollars on it. I requested they send me a copy of every monthly statement for the entire time I had their card. 
Needless to say they where lying. I had paid hundreds of dollars over the years on that insurance. Even up until my last statement. It was XXXX XXXX dollars. I also found out when requesting my statements the had the wrong address for me on file. I always paid with my app and never knew it. Also I found out that over the years I had spent hounded of dollars on late fee peniltys cause as I said I paid with my phone and never looked at all that. I thought the payment was on the same day every month so for years every other month or so I was paying a late fee. And on top of that every so many years the fee would go up. In the end I was paying {$50.00} somethin dollars a month every other month or so. Now you would think that they would have seen that and said something but they didnt. 
They said the program ended coincidentally a few months before I got into that bind and they gave another so many months to file but like I said I wasnt paying it by then and I defiantly wasnt getting their mail outs on that kinda stuff. End the end they would not let me file one the very thing I had been paying for all those years when I really needed it. Now when I really need good credit cause of a wife and XXXX children and XXXX more on the way I have bad credit. If yall could help that would be awesome."

Student loan,"Over the last 4 weeks I have been actively attempting to payoff 1 of 4 loans I have with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX company. 
- I made a {$1300.00} payment request in XXXX, it was reversed 3 days later. 
- I inquired about it, the customer service rep was unable to tell me why. He advised he will inquire and will contact me back. Never did. 
- 4 days later I see the {$1300.00} payment is being made, but spread across the 4 loans rather than how I authorized it towards 1 loan. 
- I inquired again and was told I would be refunded. It never happened. 
- I again called and requested that the payment is properly allocated towards the right loan. I was told by a "" Supervisor '' that it will be, 5 days later and it has yet to be done. 

Terrible company. There has to be something illegal about what they're doing. I'm currently in process of transferring my loans to another company."
Mortgage,"I have submitted 23 disputes to FREEDOM Mortgage and they have been non responsive to my many concerns related to the processing of my refinance application. I have received several letters from FREEDOM Mortgage stating to allow up to thirty ( 30 ) business days for a response. The response time has expired on letters received as far back as XXXX 2016. I have even sent several emails on these issues. All to no avail. 
I have contacted CFPB, Better Business Bureau, Department of Veterans Affairs and my attorney. Whys has these organization allowed FREEDOM Mortgage to continue to be non responsive to their customers, especially one who is an XXXX Military Veteran with over 30 years of service. FREEDOM Mortgage unwillingness to corporate has lead me to enroll into a repayment program. FREEDOM Mortgage insisted that they did not authorize me to miss mortgage payments during the refinance processing. I provided proof and was told that they did not authorize missed mortgage. FREEDOM Mortgage even stated to CFPB that they did not authorize me to miss mortgage payments. Claiming that documents looked suspicious. Customer may have prepared. I found that their comments were appalling and outrageous. I have attached documents on unresolved issues, numerous complaints against FREEDOM Mortgage."
Checking or savings account,Bank of America has changed how they apply debits and credits or something. They do allow some overdrafts but what they have been doing is actually clearing the debit or ach to the point on my end it shows as cleared and also they charge an NSF and then a day or so later they reverse the funds. It intermittently shows cleared even with the creditor. With the assessing of the fee and the item showing as cleared that depletes the balance even further and has caused additional NSF of things that may possibly have cleared if both the fee and transaction weren't both showing as cleared. I need a portion of those fees returned.

Debt collection,"Because of previous problems I have had with TD Bank, I decided to close my credit card with them ( they started charging me 24 % interest for similar issues that were not valid ). I paid the balance owed and asked them to close the account. The bank however continued to allow automatic electronic debits - I was charged by a previous vendor {$14.00}, days after I requested and was told the account was closed. A phone rep from TD who called my home about 2 months ago confirmed the same story. 

Since the bank allowed the charge to go through ( that they should not have ), every month they add new fees and charges. Now the balance is over $ 200+ which is almost entirely fees - due to their error. 

They called me several times. A couple of months ago a rep called and confirmed my story. I told her that I was even willing to pay the {$14.00} from the charge that they shouldn't have allowed. I offered to pay the erroneous charge but told her I wouldn't pay any of their penalties. She said she'd put my on hold and ask her supervisor. She didn't come back, and I went to work. Several times they have called in the morning as I'm headed out to work, and I asked my wife to give them my cell # and if they would call me on it I would still try to resolve things with them. Instead they keep calling my home when I'm not there - but they don't call back even after I've asked them to. 

They often send letters advising that they will report me to the credit agencies for non-payment. I'm not sure if they have or not, but the letters and bills keep coming and I will be extremely upset if they report to the credit bureaus for something they THEY caused. That's an abuse of power in my opinion - they can effectively make it very hard for me to get credit and I have no equivalent ability - it's really a shame how the system works. Anyway I hope the CFP can help resolve the problem since TD Bank doesn't listen to me.

I've made it clear that I wasn't in the District when this account was opened, and when this card was used.

I immediately reviewed this alert and found it was a past due payment of {$11.00} from Wells Fargo. I was surprised by this as I had not used this particular credit card in more than two years. I called Wells Fargo and they told me there had been a random one-time charge to my account and it had not been paid in 30 days so they notified the credit bureaus. I asked them why they didn't contact me and they said they sent me notification, they emailed me and they called me. I received no communication from Wells Fargo. I asked the woman if they left a message when they called and her response was that they were not obligated to do so. The first thing I did was pay the {$11.00} and received a confirmation. The next day I receive another alert that Wells Fargo had sent this to collections -- after I paid the past due amount. I contacted the credit bureaus to see if they could help and they informed me that I would have to take this up with Wells Fargo.

I asked to speak to a supervisor and he told me that there was no one any higher up.

I have been a client of Wells Fargo for many years and it's highly disturbing that this is how they treat their loyal customers.

The excuse I received from customer service was that the third-party team who initially approved the application missed some things. Sorry, that's not my fault. I have upheld my end of the credit relationship. 

Had I known that my credit limit could be decreased at any time ( for no good reason ) and without advance notice ... I would not have applied for this card. But now I'm stuck. If I cancel the card, that will have a negative impact on my credit report because of the short length of time the account has been open."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The official AnnualCreditReport website is intended to be an easily accessible way for consumers to review their credit reports from XXXX, Experian, and XXXX each year. After entering my personal information on this website on XX/XX/2019, including my social security number, I was immediately notified by all three credit bureaus that they are unable to deliver my credit report online for some unexplained reason, and instead simply redirected me to either a phone number or a postal address. I could have reached out via these channels on my own without having to visit the AnnualCreditReport website and entering my SSN -- so what is the purpose of the AnnualCreditReport website? It seems to me that the credit bureaus are only on the AnnualCreditReport website to make it seem as though they are transparent and easy to reach, while they really are discouraging access to information by creating unnecessary hurdles for consumers to jump through."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","While I was searching job online I was approached by they call them self XXXX XXXX XXXX vacant position as Data Entry Jobs and they told me that this job will pay {$28.00} per hour and I replied them about the job and they set me an interview day online through XXXX  chat.

I also contacted XXXX customer fraud protection unit and they recover half of the money."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello. 

I originally had a collection account with Quality Asset Recovery ( Company 1 ) and then the collections was bought out by XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( Company 2 ) to which I paid in full the entire account as of XX/XX/2019. After XXXX, I noticed that the collections were still not removed from my XXXX XXXX and repeatedly called both companies to try to resolve the issue. Company 1 claims that they will not remove it off my report because I did not pay them. Company 2 says that they called Company 1 saying I paid in full. I called the ORIGINAL lender and they told me that the amount of what I paid is correct for Company 2, so I know that the entire account and all of the invoices listed are now paid in full.

To date, and 5 months later, there are three collections still on my credit report even though I have called everyone many, many times and even filed disputes to correct this and close the accounts. Company 2 said they even mailed information over to all credit agencies, but I have no record of them doing so. Additionally, they now state that I am not allowed to call Company 1 because they hold my account. I just want this off  of my credit report, hopefully as of XXXX, since I am trying to build my credit and this has been a thorn in my side for months. I never get a complete answer."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I wish to dispute the {$710.00} transaction for {$60.00} for the following reason incorrect billing and purported collection of sales tax. Please find information from the Florida Department of Revenue supporting my assertion that the merchant, XXXX XXXX, is not obligated to collect sales tax on cosmetology e.g., hair and nail services, the merchant category code in which they operate. As stated previously, the amount of the original transaction was {$650.00} ( {$600.00} for services plus {$50.00} tip ). Not sure how they arrived at {$710.00}, since that doesnt calculate to the purported 7 % tax, over charging me {$60.00} above what was originally agreed. Barclays claim that they do not have any responsibility to assist in resolving this billing dispute since it was a card present and in person transaction is erroneous. Even Barclay 's own internal records support that the transaction was entered manually several times, with varying amounts. They obviously manipulated the amount after we left the establishment. Either they are guilty of incompetence or intentional fraud, but in either circumstance, I should not be held liable for merchant billing errors."
Mortgage,"I recently submitted a loan modification application to Caliber Home Loans that was denied the week of XX/XX/XXXX. As a result, I submitted an appeal. 

The basis for my complaint is that every Caliber Home Loan representative that I had spoken with BEFORE and during this process neglected to tell me that I would not qualify for a modification because I had one in XXXX, finalized in XXXX. In fact, one representative told me WHEN to apply and that I needed to wait ONE year which meant that I could apply as of XX/XX/XXXX. No one told me that I would NOT qualify based on those facts which would have been extremely helpful. More importantly, it was my right to know and be properly informed. 

This is not the first time that I have been given the wrong information from a Caliber representative. I have experienced this before and as a result, a manager by the name XXXX, had to personally review my file because I had been misinformed and my file had been improperly handled. At that time, I was initially denied a modification and after XXXX handled the case, I received a modification, and completed the trial payments seamlessly. All of this is a manner of record ( recorded and verifiable ). This time, once I received the denial letter, I contacted the company, requested to speak with a manager because I was tired of the runaround and misinformation. Nevertheless, they did not allow me to do so.

I do not believe Caliber exhausted all the hardship options available and for this reason, I think it is unfair and unprofessional that I'm continuously given incorrect information especially regarding such a serious matter. As a homeowner experiencing a hardship, I deserve to have all my options explored which I don't believe they have been. Additionally, I deserve to receive accurate information so I can be fully aware of the process and where I stand."
Debt collection,"SPS Select Portfolio Servicing of XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT appears to be a debt collection agency, who started a systematic harassment by mail debt collection campaign against wife, XXXX XXXX. 

This harassment following a failed foreclosure attempt over the past 2 years ( XXXX-XXXX ) by XXXX XXXX XXXX and their attorneys ( XXXX ) over a 2nd Mortgage default loan by XXXX, approximately 10 Years ago.

I have intentions of keeping the property and would like to be reviewed for a modification assistance and also a principle reduction as my property value its very low with a high principle balance."
Student loan,"I attended XXXX XXXX College back when it was located in XXXX California before they moved to XXXX. I was young, just had a XXXX   and was looking to start a career. I joined their XXXX XXXX XXXX program approximately XX/XX/2006. Although the program was not yet accredited, I was promised that it would be by the time of my completion. I was so happy when I finally graduated and felt accomplished. Unfortunately for me and my class mates, the accreditation of the program that we were promised never came resulting in not being able to qualify for state licensing which made us undesirable to employers. No one wanted to hire me with out my state license and in order to attain one, I needed one year experience which I could not get. The two basically cancelled each other out. After this, XXXX XXXX College shut down the program I took ( XXXX XXXX XXXX   ) because they couldn't attain the accreditation and then moved the whole school to the now XXXX location. 

Since then I have not been able to be employed at all in the certificate that I earned through them and have not been able to afford any payment towards my school loans. I am a struggling single mother and times are hard. So I recently applied for a school closure discharge through Fed loan servicing. I felt i qualified because although XXXX XXXX College still operates and provides numerous programs, the specific program I took ( XXXX  ) was closed and no longer offered through them because of their own shortcomings with the accreditation. Fed loan told me I did not qualify for the school closure discharge because I completed the program.. 

I do not understand how being a school "" drop out '' would better qualify me for the discharge. XXXX XXXX College was unscrupulous towards me and many other students, it was even proven in court.. and here I am struggling to attain employment and not being able to pay for a loan which resulted in nothing.. and not to mention the program I completed was closed and the location itself was closed. 

These student loans have haunted me for over a decade. The experience itself has haunted me. I was looking forward to possibly going back to school if i qualified for the discharge and was excited to possibly move my life in a positive direction. These student loans I have now have stopped me from going back to school because I cant afford any more debt. I am left with not very many options and I am filing this complaint with you to hopefully find some answers and solutions.."

With all this being said I did all this to get my credit back in good standing so they were to report it, because I was moving and needed to get a credit check, I then find out XX/XX/XXXX that they reported me as not making a payment in XX/XX/XXXX and haven't reported ANY of my current payments - I called them and spoke to several people who said they have to follow the fair credit reporting standards etc etc however the agent I spoke to, XX/XX/XXXX said they dont have to report me as making payments and positive until I am in good standing, but yet that doesn't seem correct because I have made payments and you are reporting me as XX/XX/XXXX NOT making a payment then XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX you have no payments at all reflected, I can understand XX/XX/XXXX but NOT XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. They won't fix my score until after my next billing cycle she said.

Mortgage,"Our mortgage was transferred from XXXX to Shellpoint New Rez. When they did this, I set up a one time automatic payment thru my bank to NewRez to cover the 1st pmt. I paid {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19, which is the full mortgage payment for XX/XX/2019. NewRez then did an ACH for {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19, and took another ACH for {$1800.00} on XX/XX/19. I have called for a refund of the two erroneous payments. At first they told me that I must prove that they took the XX/XX/19 pmt, which I did. I have since spoken with at least 7 different reps at their call line, who each tell me that they are escalating. Each time they do this, they tell me that it will be 2-3 days, 24-48 hours, 4-5 days ... for us to see the refund in our bank account. I completed the "" Contact Us '' on their website 3 times, I faxed them with confirmation, and I also wrote a snail mail letter as they state that we have rights under the Federal Gov't. All of these attempts have provided NO response from this company. They destroyed our budget and put us in a negative with other debtors when they pulled a total of {$3600.00} that they were not entitled to. On top of this, the statement then showed that the next pmt was due XX/XX/2019, which is also incorrect - based upon these payments no pmt was due until XX/XX/2019. They've now moved the {$3600.00} to "" Unapplied Balance '' so it is not benefiting the interest on the mortgage either. I was told yesterday that this was escalated to this person 's supervisor who is the only one who will be able to find out why the escalations have not brought results. I was on the phone again today filing another complaint. I am now told that a XXXX XXXX will call me within 24-48 hours, so again we wait. Since it is XX/XX/2019 and payment is due no later than the 15th ( and I never wait this long ), they offered to move the unapplied balance to the loan. I don't trust them to do this, so filed the complaint once again today requesting the refund. I gave them the bank and routing number in one of the previous calls and was told we would see the funds back in our account within 24-48 hours. I have removed the banking information on our account with them so they can not do this again, and have set up automatic payments through our bank, but this does not resolve the situation that we have with them now."
Debt collection,"I received a debt collection letter from XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1000.00}. I sent XXXX XXXX a debt validation letter certified by U.S. mail on XX/XX/2018. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I had yet to receive a response so I decided to give them a call. I told the representative that I am looking to purchase a home and I need all negative items removed from my report immediately. I also told her that the debt is not mine and has not been validated but I am willing to pay just to have it removed. She agreed to a pay for delete in the amount of {$400.00}. After I requested proof of what we agreed to, she put me on hold and came back to say that I would need to pay the full balance. I requested to speak to a supervisor and they demanded that I pay the full balance as well. I told the supervisor that they were trying to take advantage of my situation knowing that the debt was not mine but I desperately needed to have it removed to proceed with the homebuying process. Shortly after, I came across an article where this same company had been sued for shady collection practices. I believe they were trying to prey on me and reel me in as well. This is not fair to consumers like myself who are trying to go about clearing debt in the correct manner."
Student loan,"I requested an IDR plan via studentloans.gov on XX/XX/XXXX, about a month before my first payment would be due to XXXX XXXX. They sent me a bill for {$310.00} and only billed me for my loans from undergraduate. I have new loans now because I just finished grad school in the summer of XX/XX/XXXX. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX to check in about why my IDR application hadn't been processed because I knew the payment they provided was too high. The person on the phone told me that the application hadn't been processed and I had to request forbearance to avoid making a payment so I requested a forbearance and now, 12 days later, it was never processed and there's no record that I requested as forbearance. I submitted a complaint through their ombuds and they told me that I never requested a one month forbearance on my original IDR application and they sent me a copy of a paper application ( I completed the application online ). I'm on the phone with them now and they're telling me that I need to pay a minimum of {$5.00} to switch my loans to an IDR plan and that my IDR application is done, yet my account still says I'm 12 days past due and that I owe them {$1300.00}. At no point have they contacted me to tell me my IDR application was approved, to tell me what my payments would be, to tell me what loans do or do not qualify. There is a "" request summary '' on my account homepage that has a status bar that says they received my IDR request, but nothing further has been done. I'm on the phone now with XXXX # XXXX and he's telling my application has been processed, I just need to pay a {$5.00} min to get my loans switched over to a new plan. I'm so confused and angry because every time I call their customer service folks give me different answers. They don't know what they're talking about and then they don't follow through. There was a note on my account that said they weren't going to do the forbearance because my loans were in queue or something of that nature. He's now saying that the person tried to place the forbearance on all my loans instead of the ones I was originally billed for, which is why the forbearance never went through. I paid the {$5.00} minimum and the customer service person, XXXX, notated this on my account. I'm not sure why I had to pay {$5.00} for my request to be processed however."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am requesting to remove the bankruptcy from my credit report because that on was to old and you supposed to removed a long time ago. 
Although it is your policy to keep reporting bankruptcies which are filed or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681c relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings.

The law states from date of adjudication or date of order for relief. Any case, civil or otherwise, that has been dismissed no longer exists in the eyes of the law and a case filed may never have actually been adjudicated.

Mortgage,"My mortgage loan is in default and was recently transferred from Seterus to Nationstar/Mr. Cooper. Ultimately I will lose my home through foreclosure since Seterus was unwilling to work with me to save my home and I fear Nationstar will continue this practice. My loan qualifies for mortgage assistance, but Seterus kept telling me that I have had too many workout plans already. However, the one modification they gave me they made an accounting mistake and never accounted for my second trial modification payment. When I called in to fix this they basically said that there is nothing they can do and kept telling me to call back next month to see if they can help me. I have not had a single point of contact that I could work with and will lose my home through foreclosure if something isnt done. I am a XXXX   XXXX  and am not always in the country. A few years ago, I foolishly trusted my boyfriend to take care of the mortgage payments while I was gone for months at a time taking care of my patient. Instead of being responsible and making the mortgage payments, he took the money I sent him and squandered it. I was unaware of that I was delinquent on my mortgage payments until I came back to the country and found out I was delinquent. I contacted Seterus and I got a trial modification in XXXX of 2018. I made my XXXX payment and called Seterus in XXXX to make my next payment. One of their representatives, XXXX, called my bank to verify funds while I was on the line and was told the funds were in the bank. Everything was verified and I was told the payment was made, but their representative made a mistake and did not do the transaction. Then I was advised by XXXX that my payment did not go through because I GAVE THE WRONG ACCOUNT NUMBER for my bank account. However, it is impossible that I gave them the wrong number since XXXX confirmed the bank account number while she was on the line with my bank! After that everything fell apart and I lost my modification. I tried to work this out with them, but they have turned their backs on me and now I will lose my home through foreclosure if you can not help me."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I signed up for a "" TransUnion MySmartmove '' account at www.mysmartmove.com, which is a rental screening service operated by TransUnion, in order to have a report generated for a potential landlord.

However, MySmartmove does not provide a copy of the report to the consumer through the website. Only the landlord can access the report on the website. Instead, they direct the consumer to call their XXXX number to request a copy of the report.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Since 2017 I have sent numerous written requests to the credit agency Equifax in the matter of two accounts that appear on my credit from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have requested debt validation of these companies listed on my credit report per Section 609 of the FCRA ... Section 609 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) refers to a consumer reporting agency 's obligation to disclose information to consumers upon request. Credit reporting agencies are required to make available all information in the consumer 's file, as well as the sources of the information on file. The information disclosed must also include the dates and original payees of all accounts. Further, Section 609 of the FCRA stipulates that consumer reporting agencies must clearly make consumers aware of their right to dispute information in their credit file. I have to this day received no validation, no proof of any contract or orally any agreement showing I owe a debt to this company. I have submitted proof that one of the amounts listed for {$500.00} was removed by XXXX, but yet this amount still appears on my Equifax report. This is a clear and blatant violation of Section 609 because nothing has been provided to me despite the numerous times I have requested validation of these accounts from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am humbly asking tis matter to please be investigated.

Mortgage,"In brief: 
(1) Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. did not and does not credit my XX/XX/XXXX payment to my account.
(2) Dovenmuehle Mortgage officially started servicing the mortgage on XXXX XXXX, 2017.The payment in the amount of $XXXX was made to the previous servicing company, XXXX XXXX XXXX, c/o XXXX XXXX. It was due on XX/XX/17, paid on XX/XX/17, cleared by my bank on XX/XX/17. This payment was properly credited to my account and later verified by the XXXX. 

In more detail:
Until XX/XX/17, my mortgage was serviced by the XXXX XXXX XXXX, c/o XXXX XXXX. The servicing was transferred to Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. effective XX/XX/17. I received a statement from them on XX/XX/17, before receiving any information about the loan servicing transfer, but such letters from the both companies did arrive later.

The statement listed double of the amount due as being due on XXXX XXXX (the normal monthly amount due is $XXXX). I made a normal monthly payment to Dovenmuehle Mortgage by check for my XX/XX/XXXX payment, it was received by them on XX/XX/17 and credited as my XX/XX/XXXX payment, so they still list me as being one month behind in my mortgage payments.

I have made a number of calls to Dovenmuehle Mortgage, from XX/XX/17 to this day (XX/XX/17). I have been made promises that they would investigate the matter, but no results followed, and no explanations were given. I also e-mailed confirmations of the XX/XX/XXXX payment from the XXXX website and from my bank, as requested by Dovenmuehle Mortgage, on XX/XX/17, but, once again, the matter has still not been resolved.

In particular, I was informed by the previous mortgage servicing company that they overnighted confirmation of my account information to Dovenmuehle Mortgage on XX/XX/17. Apparently, this information has not been processed or taken into the account by Dovenmuehle Mortgage. 

Moreover, according to the XXXX representative, the payoff amount given by them to Dovenmuehle Mortgage accounted for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. XXXX sent me a copy of the information. But the statements and the online account info from Dovenmuehle Mortgage have apparently been using a different (and greater) amount for their starting of servicing the loan on XX/XX/17. They use $XXXX instead of the correct amount of $XXXX. The difference corresponds to the payment that has not been credited by Dovenmuehle Mortgage.

The desired outcome of this case would be in crediting my XX/XX/XXXX payment, adjusting the principle of my mortgage, setting the next payment due date as XX/XX/XXXX (or as XX/XX/XXXX if the process is finished after I make my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/17). 

Here is a partial list of the Dovenmuehle Mortgage representatives and supervisors that I have had talked to:

There were others before them, but I did not record this information during a number of my initial calls to Dovenmuehle Mortgage."
Student loan,"My payments were about to go up in XX/XX/XXXX and I knew that we would not be able to afford the increased payment due to my husband now working part time and our medical bills due to health issues. I called twice in XX/XX/XXXX and each person stated that the payment was not going up. At the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a statement that my payments were going up. I called WEEKLY to try and resolve this issue. The first call in XX/XX/XXXX, I was set up on a payment plan. I was given a confirmation number and told to pay the first installment of the payment plan. I went through the terms and conditions with the woman and accepted. She said it should reflect on my account in 3-4 business days. I gave it 7 days, and my account still stated I owed the full amount. So I called back. This person I spoke to told me that the repayment plan did not get approved and they had tried to call me 3 times but my phone number was disconnected ( it definitely was not, I have had the same number since XX/XX/XXXX ). So we set up a new payment plan, I got a new confirmation number, I went through the terms and condition and they wanted me to pay the first installment. I had just paid an installment the week before, so he refunded the first payment and I paid another payment for this plan. He said it would reflect in 5-7 business days. I gave it 10 business days and my account still showed behind. So I called back. The person on the phone said the processing department was still working on it. I asked when I should call back and check, and he stated "" If you are that worried about it you can call back and check on it, but it is processing the new payment plan ''. 4 days later, it still was not showing and so I called back. This person said that my new payment plan was not approved but they knew a way to make it happen. I got signed up for a new plan, went through the terms and conditions and got another confirmation number. My payment for this plan was not due until XX/XX/XXXX. 7 days later, it was now past my original due date, XX/XX/XXXX, and my payment showed past due. I called back and spoke to another woman who was incredibly rude so I asked to speak to a manager. The manager came on and I asked her to explain to me what was going on. She said that one I made that first payment of the new payment plan, it would "" kick start '' and my account would go current. So I asked if I could go ahead and make the payment. So on XX/XX/XXXX, I made another payment to start my newest payment plan. She said I would get the terms and conditions in 3-4 business days and it would reflect on my account. I kept telling her I did not want this to go on my credit. She assured me it would not. I have checked my account since then, and it had never said current. It always said past due. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a delinquent letter. I called on XX/XX/XXXX and I was told that the new payment plan did not go through, AGAIN. I asked to speak to a supervisor. This woman stated that it was a new type of loan ( even though they have had this loan for 2 years ) and there was no possible way for me to get a repayment plan or new terms. I asked for deferment for 9 months - 1 year, and all she said was are you able to make the payment to catch your loan up? I asked her why no one has tried to call and tell me any of this and why I had been told that I would have a new payment plan so many times and she just kept saying she apologized for the inconvenience. I have been promised 3 different times a new repayment plan. And now there could possibly be a delinquent report on my credit. All I wanted was to defer or lower my payments until my husband could work full time again. I am thoroughly disappointed in the unprofessionalism of this company."
Bank account or service,"XXXX 2015 : I called to make a payment on XXXX, asked the rep directly if they could waive any of the late fees from previous months since I was catching up from being XXXX payment behind. In previous calls trying to catch up I asked if I had late fees to pay and reps at times said no. What they really meant was you do n't have to pay them now. Slightly inaccurate when a customer ( me ) asks what is my late fee or when does it apply. 
Last XXXX XXXX, I called to make a payment ; the young lady said late fees go into effect on the XXXX so I could have a manager call me back. Wrong! Yes a manager could call me back but a late fee was applied to my account {$28.00} for waiting to hear back from a manager. I still offered to make a payment Thursday the XXXX so it 's Super upsetting to incur any fee for something you ask about directly and are misinformed about. 
She was wrong about the late feeShe was wrong about having a manger call me back. Someone called saying they were from US Bank and left vm with general XXXX numbers and no name. so I had to call back XXXX and start the request for manager to call back all over again. 
This is all happening so fast my XXXX credit rating has slipped below XXXX. Thanks US Bank for making it so difficult to get accurate information about payment and fees information. Your reps are wildly inconsistent. 
Are they trying to drive customers into further default? 
Is US Bank trying to cause consumers to default on home mortgages and they foreclose on them? 
I 'm back to work as will be paid in full as of XX/XX/2015. How about the rest of their customers who are n't as fortunate and have to go through the repeated misinformation and delays associated with trying to get right information and make right amounts of payments to get out from default. God bless ... 
Please advise ...

Credit card or prepaid card,"I filed a complaint last year regarding American Express Serve, they claimed my account was over drawn by {XXXX}. I provided statement records showing that they never added a refund from a return from XXXX. I kept getting the run around and they never could show when and where the money was ever returned to my account which resulted in a very rare overdraft of {XXXX} on a XXXX account. Regardless I was tired of dealing with it and they would not let me close the account so I figured I would deal with it later. I continued to receive monthly emails informing me that my account was XXXX} overdrawn until XX/XX/XXXX when I received this email : During a recent review of your American Express Serve Account we noticed activity that was in violation of the Serve Member Agreement, section : XXXX.

I tried to get some information but my account was now suspended, I had been blocked from speaking to any one and I had no access to my money or information as to how I went from owing them {XXXX} to now having a credit of {XXXX} that I can't access.

Student loan,"After graduating from XXXX School in 2005, I attended XXXX University. During my tenure as a student, I acquired significant private student loan debts ( mostly through Sallie Mae, now Navient ) to try to stay afloat. I was not able to secure much federal aid due to my parent still claiming me as a dependent. I did not end up attaining a degree from XXXX University nor have I since entered a career space based on my studies there ( XXXX XXXX ). I was never living some high life with a new car or a nice place to live. 

After dropping out of XXXX due to financial reasons -- looming student loan debts with no means to secure enough educational funding to continue -- I eventually entered the workforce via the best means available to me without a degree. Despite having steady, salaried work for years ( 30-45k per  year ), I could not make a dent in my loan debts being barely able to afford the monthly minimums on top of basic needs ( food, shelter, transportation ). There were multiple times after I lost my most recent job ( XXXX ) and I returned to school, that forbearance was offered to me as an escape from default. 

Currently, I am an a better financial position in a secure, degreed career path. However, the private loans still loom in greater amounts than ever before. I'll be able to scrape and scrounge to try pay them back in the next 10-15 years while any chance of owning a home or moving forward in life before turning XXXX quickly vanishes."
Mortgage,"BBVA - XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit Score Ruined XX/XX/XXXX In XX/XX/XXXX, we ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) applied for a Construction XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX but were denied because of bad credit, low XXXX credit score. We were shocked, thought we had perfect credit. We are responsible business owners in our XXXX, pay all of our bills on-time, do not have any credit card debt and make a good living. Never saw this coming and we are devastated. Not only can we not obtain a mortgage for homeownership but we can not get loans to build XXXX XXXX XXXX is  our livelihood for the past 30 years. We are in trouble. 
Apparently BBVA had been sending our Visa credit card statement to an erroneous address and a {$40.00} charge did not get paid for months. BBVA made no attempt to notify us of this issue which ultimately ruined our credit and now we are unable to get a mortgage or spec house loans. As a matter of fact the Teller at BBVA researched our account and it showed that our Visa paper statements had all been sent back ( returned to sender ) to BBVA, so they were aware that we were not receiving these statements. 
Our BBVA Visa credit card was opened at the same time we got a {$120000.00} BBVA equity loan on our previous home, used loan to do some major remodeling. Loan was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. 
We did not ask for, nor did we knowingly apply for the Visa card but BBVA offered the Visa card along with the Equity loan. They also offered us a discount on our loan payment if we opened a checking account and gave us a {$1000.00} overdraft protection account. Again all we applied for and intended to get was an Equity loan we never asked for the Visa, checking, or over-draft protection account.

At some point after opening equity loan, along with the other accounts BBVA threw in, we realized BBVA had an erroneous address for us so I ( K ) physically went into the local bank branch to have the teller go into our accounts and change our mailing address to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Note that our XXXX XXXX mailing address has been the same for over 20 years and is the only address that we have ever used. 
Currently our statements for the Equity line of credit, Checking and Overdraft Protection all show the corrected address. But not the BBVA Visa, it still shows a bad address that BBVA imposed on us when our accounts were established, which is 50 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --. Obviously the Teller did not change the address for the Visa at the same time she changed address on other accounts. Much to our ignorance we believed that when I physically went into the BBVA bank branch and changed our address to XXXX. XXXX that it changed our address for ALL of our BBVA accounts. This is how it works at XXXX XXXX where we have banked for over 30 years. But the Teller at BBVA did not notify me that the address change was not for all accounts so we had no way of knowing. 

Also, unbeknownst to us, the BBVA Visa credit card was never linked to our online account for us to see any activity and we had never received a paper statement to make us aware that the Visa card was not linked to our online account. Since never ever receiving a separate statement for the BBVA statement, had no idea there was a separate statement, we believed the blue Visa credit cards were linked to our BBVA checking and overdraft account. We never even used the BBVA Visa until 8 months after receiving card when we used it once for a {$40.00} computer security program again fully believing it was linked to our checking or overdraft account, which had and still has more than enough money to cover {$40.00}, so we certainly never thought about it not getting paid. 
The address shown on our BBVA Visa credit card statement is XXXX  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - which was an old address where we rented temporarily before we bought XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- house in XXXX of XXXX, financed by XXXX and got equity loan by BBVA. 
Note that we had lived at XXXX for a year before we obtained the Equity loan from BBVA so we would not have ever given the old temporary rental house address of XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - as our mailing or physical address. Our guess is the BBVA Mortgage Officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX-, or someone else at BBVA who inputted our information into the system, saw this address on our credit report ( I guess ) and inputted this bad address? Again our correct mailing address for over 20 years is XXXX. XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --. 
Also, I am not sure how we received the physical BBVA Visa credit card being that BBVA had wrong address on our Visa account. But when we moved out of rental house the summer of XXXX we did submit a change of address with the XXXX  Florida Post Office ( from XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- and forwarded to XXXX. XXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- ), just to make sure if anything unknowingly sent here, any packages etc, they would eventually find us. So possibly the credit card was forwarded to us and is how we received. 
The change of address forwarding of mail through the postal service is only good for a certain amount of time possibly was in effect just long enough to get the physical card forwarded to us but shortly after expired before we could start receiving the statements. PERFECT STORM! 
So not only were we unknowingly not able to view our Visa statement on our online banking we were also unknowingly not receiving the paper statement by mail because BBVA did not change our mailing address as I requested, resulting in ultimately ruining our credit. 
Once we were made aware of the unpaid charges we immediately paid cash in person {$40.00} on XX/XX/XXXX at the local XXXX BBVA bank branch. Although the account is paid in full BBVA is still reporting the status of our account to the Credit Bureau as a Charge Off   which has ruined our credit score. We are not experts at credit reporting language but seems like if an account is paid in full by the consumer, it could not also be Charged Off, either is was paid in full OR it was charged off as bad debt. Which Charge Off seems to be the worst status to have, ruined our credit like its close to foreclosure or bankruptcy. In addition our BBVA Visa account currently shows that it is open and has a {$200.00} credit limit. Everything is conflicting as to the status of this account. 
Anyway we understand our part, our responsibility part, we made the {$40.00} charge and missed following up on it to make sure it was paid. Trusting our bank had our back, online banking linked, changed our address to correct and receiving our statements for all accounts. Although we are not 100 % to blame, BBVA holds some responsibility here too. Yet we are ruined, our bread & butter business ruined, no spec loans and possibly we cant qualify as a XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX   for our customers. Plus the loss of obtaining home ownership - but BBVA remains unscathed and unwilling to help us out of this mess. This is not right! Is there anyone human at BBVA? If a human with common sense looked at the situation I dont think they would elect to ruin these people ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) over {$40.00}. Plus we are a BBVA customer, does this not mean anything? Why would BBVA want to ruin us? Does BBVA value their customers? 
We borrowed {$120000.00} from BBVA, made every payment timely and paid it off in full. Perfect customers. When the {$40.00} charge was made we had and still have the money in our BBVAs accounts to pay the {$40.00}. 
Bottom line - BBVA hooked us into this credit card offer with the equity loan mortgage. Then flubbed up by not having it logged in correctly so when we checked online it did not show up - and they used a bogus address to send the bill - when the bill was returned they made no good faith effort to correct their billing and notify the customer. Now no good faith in trying to correct the damage. As a matter of fact once we paid the {$40.00} balance on the Visa, BBVA changed the credit rating status from bad Delinquent Closed Account to an even worse status Charge Off!!! WHY????????????????????

BBVA hands are definitely not clean. They bear some weight of the burden here. It does not make common sense for a customer to pay off {$120000.00} and be a charge off for {$40.00}. What is wrong with this picture? Does anyone care enough at BBVA to get to the bottom of this fiasco and try to figure out a solution? 

TO RECAP : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX received {$120000.00} 2nd mortgage equity loan from BBVA 2. BBVA hooked on a credit card with the mortgage 3. BBVA hooked on a bogus address to the credit card 4. XXXX physically went to the BBVA branch to correct address 5. XXXX XXXX XXXX sold home, paid off BBVA {$120000.00} 2nd mortgage equity loan, perfect payment history, perfect customer 6. XXXX XXXX XXXX applied for mortgage to buy new house - found out CREDIT RUINED by BBVA - emotionally went to pieces and got sick-we are a small business, our credit rating is our life 's blood, we will be ruined 7. BBVA had not corrected our address on the credit card, therefore there was a mere {$40.00} balance that had not been paid by us because BBVA had flubbed up on changing our address. In fact they had  used such an old address where we didn't even live when they first issued the credit card. We have no idea where they dug up that old address. THIS WAS THE MAJOR FAULT THAT HAS CAUSED OUR DEVASTATING PROBLEM. 
8. We do not know why BBVA did not change address when we went to the branch to have this done, we do not know why they did not catch their mistake when the credit card statements were returned to them, we do not know why they did not note we had an overdraft protection on our account and had paid off {$120000.00} so we obviously would not try to dodge paying {$40.00}. Does this sound like clean hands by BBVA? Why can't they just realize there were many mistakes made by all the parties and take the "" charge off '' our credit report, and save our lives, STOP THE BLEEDING."

The first recalculation of XXXX was dated XXXX XXXX with a monthly of {$980.00}. This first calculation was incorrectly done by fed loan because they used my old tax form of XXXX which I had uploaded in XXXX that stated that I filed jointly with my husband now ex-husband. And it was used to calculate my 1rst IDR request of XXXX even though I had uploaded my current tax form XXXX which indicated that Im head of household and single. The error was made by fed load not by me. All the current files were uploaded to be reviewed by fed loan, and they failed in doing so.

I always took a one hour lunch and spent it days on end on hold with XXXX. I could never get anyone to come on line. The only response is automations encouraging you to wait. My simple question was how did my billing get to be so expensive, and I was suspecting there was some form of fraud. After I had finished my term for the job I decided to wait all day to talk to someone no matter what or how long it took. I was told there were movie rentals which I did not give approval for, but still no one could have a bill that large from movies. I ask the representative to send me the billings for the past months so that I could see detailed information. So finally I did get a billing with only dates and dollar amount with no explanations as to what the charges were for. I was discouraged and sad that I had to give up XXXX. Within the next few months I began checking my credit reports only to find that XXXX had written off the billing as a Charge Off. I was relieved and truthfully at my age I would probably be dead before the bill was paid. So it was written off and I believed that to be true because it was on the credit reports. I do understand collections and know that some old billings do get sold for maybe XXXX cents and a new collector like this one is trying to collect. If it is written off then I am not obligated. However if I should every win the lottery then I will pay anything I owe off in a heartbeat. I am not happy about this interruption and will be going through my old credit reports to look for the Charge Off. I think someone needs to do their homework."

Mortgage,"The property address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Ga XXXX XXXX. My loan was included in a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, whereby the court ordered Bankruptcy petition Plan ( the Plan ) included set payment amounts ( {$140.00} monthly ). 
2. I began making the payments to the mortgage company exactly as specified. 
3. The servicer was changed ( or loan sold ) and I re-directed my payments to the new company ( BSI ). 
4. After a few months, the new company began rejecting my payments, stating that they had no knowledge of the Plan, and started the foreclosure process. BSI states that they are refusing the payments because the loan is in foreclosure. 
5. After much calling, faxing and emailing, I was able to get the company to recognize the Plan, which had been made an amendment to the original Security Deed and recorded with the State of Georgia. They adjusted their records, including loan balance, payment amount, interest rate, etc. They continue to refuse to accept the payment. They continue to charge fees for taxes and insurance ( via an escrow account ) even though the Plan specifically states that I am to pay the taxes and insurance directly : NO ESCROW ACCOUNT. The payments I've been sending ( {$140.00} ) are, of course, less than the amount they are requesting since the escrow amount is INVALID. 
6. I have sent the company emails demonstrating that I've made each payment for the past 5 years and have sent proof of the insurance policies established and tax payments made.

7. I requested but have not received via email a Statement of all of my Post Petition Payments and fees. 
8. The company has sent the last mortgage statement, indicating that the amount due is over {$4000.00}. This amount includes fees, property inspection charges, and grass cutting fees of over {$1900.00} each. Note that BSI NEVER CUT the grass ; I had the grass cut and paid the lawn contractor directly. I have requested a summary of all fees that have accrued on the account. None of these fees are valid since no payments have ever been missed. If BSI can indicate any payment of {$140.00} that I have missed, or any tax/insurance payment that I failed to make, I will send them the corresponding funds asap. The late fees and charges should be removed asap, as they stem from a balance that should never have accrued. 

I have and will be including all of my records : notification demonstrating each of the payments mentioned, a copy of the Statement, the Foreclosure Notification from BSI, my Bankruptcy Plan documents, the email thread between myself and the servicer, the names and email addresses of each of the supervisors to whom I've spoken, etc."
Student loan,"Loans went into repayment in XXXX after I finished graduate school. I didn't successfully complete certification for my new career until XXXX of XXXX. Between that time my loans had been transferred to Navient of whom I contacted several times to see if I could pay a reduced amount toward my loan. They told me they could not accept any other payment other than what they had stated to me during my conversation with them. I explained that I could not afford the amount they wanted me to pay, but I could make a monthly contribution within my means so that I could just start repayment. Over and over again on calls I was told that NO money would be accepted and instead my loans were placed into deferment, then eventually forbearance which over time has collected a large amount of interest. In XXXX I was pretty much forced to find a solution to my loan debt or else my loans would of defaulted, or so I was told by a Navient representative. I did find out later that I could of went on an emergency forbearance in order to prevent that. That did not happen because I was not offered that option that time through Navient. They basically said that was the only option, start paying or be placed in default. I had to do something, so I enrolled with a third party servicer, XXXX XXXX in XXXX. I learned that this company also has a lawsuit filed against them. I received information from the Federal Trade Commission regarding the lawsuit in XXXX of XXXX. There is no secret that I was not able to maintain and live with a large monthly loan payment. Even on the repayment plans offered this is not conducive. I have offered in most recent years to pay XXXX XXXX monthly with my now servicer XXXX, and they too have said that they can not accept the payment. In my case I am looking to have my interest fees waived during the time my loan was being serviced through Navient ; in particular for giving me false information regarding repayment options and resolutions for my student loans. I would not have entrusted my student loan to a third party servicer, but I felt I had no other choice. XXXX as far as I know was not making full payments on my behalf towards my loan either. I am not quite sure how to go about collecting my year 's worth of payments made to them. I am willing to pay, I just want fair options and opportunities to be presented to me in doing so."

The fair credit reporting act states that condumer reporting companies will block fraudulent information from appearing on my credit report. I sent a copy of a theft report as well as letter telling tranunion what information was fraudulent. You accepted my report and removed all information regarding the issuer from my credit report.

I am asking transunion to remove the inaccurate information off of my credit report as it violates the The Fair Credit Reporting Act
Student loan,"Fed Loan Servicing services When I started services with Fed Loan services, I was under the impression that I was making payments towards the student loan forgiveness program. 
In order to qualify for this program, I was supposed to work in a health administration office for several years and that qualified me because at the time, I was working for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I was re-certifying with Fed loan services and making payments as scheduled, but noticed that balance was never going down. 
I called Fed loan services, in XXXX and was told by a representative that I was not in the forgiveness program, but that I was in the re-payment plan..

Representative stated, ( XXXX ) stated that he would send me the application needed for me to fill out and send back to them to be on that program. He also stated that all my years of working in the health care industry would be taken into consideration. I filled out the application and advised on the application that the company, I previously worked for is closed but that I have all my income tax paperwork if needed. I also submitted information to the phone number and address to the corporate office to where I worked. 
Submitted all the information and waited -- Supposedly in 7-10 business days, I would get a response. Days passed, I called Fed-loan and representative explained that it was still in process.. Representative also stated that reason it was taking so long is because they did not have information for my previous employer.. I explained once again that i submitted all I had and also contact information., I was then told that my paperwork was still under review and that I needed to wait. 
I have called several times, and have been told that my paperwork is in compliance and that I must wait for an answer..

After researching options online, I found many stories just like mine with my same loan servicing company. This is entirely unacceptable. I did what I was supposed to. It's not my fault I was given incorrect information yet I'm the one paying the consequences while the loan servicer gets off with no consequences. I was assured by my loan servicer that I'd qualify for forgiveness. If one can't trust the people whose job it is to provide proper information, who can we trust and how do we know what to do?

XXXX XXXX had made me believe that it would be worth pursuing an FHA Streamline Refinance. Ultimately he said I do not qualify because they could only offer me a rate of 4.68 % because of my credit. Since my rate is currently at 4.75 % they would not reduce it to 4.68 % because it is too small of a change.

Credit card or prepaid card,"My husband and I have had our Best Buy card for 10 + years and during those 10 + years they have lowered our credit limit to equal the balance we had on the credit card, which made us maxed out on that card. Our scores took a big hit because of that. They have lowered our limit several times over the years for "" lack of use, '' and have threatened to close the card if we don't use it within a certain amount of time. 

They offer no incentives to encourage spending. And right now our limit is so low we couldn't buy half the stuff in the store even if we wanted to. They have not lowered our extremely high interest rate ( not even by measly 1 % ), even though we have excellent credit scores and a perfect credit history  with them. They have not raised our credit limit back up even when we were making a conscience effort to use it on a regular basis, just so they wouldn't close it. 

No promotional offers whatsoever. The only thing that they have offered are XXXX dollar off next purchase, because of what we spent on our previous purchase. I know they are not the only store card company that stoop these tactics and it is very sad. The only reason I keep them is, it will hurt our credit if they close the account, because we loose that credit history. 

I'm to the point that I just might let them close it so I can be done with them once and for all. Yes, our credit will take a hit, but it won't take long for us to bounce back. They will definitely need us before we need them ever again. In fact, I will never apply for another store card period. They are the worst and they do more harm to your credit than good."
Student loan,"Addendum to complaint XXXX On Monday XX/XX/19, after speaking to a financial advisor who told me I should try to get REPAYE bc remaining interest above 10 % would be forgiven. I said Nelnet told me I was disqualified bc I had XXXX loans. He advised me to ask if my consolidating those, I could get the grad loans on REPAYE. I called Nelnet, and was told I COULD qualify for REPAYE, but would be charged XXXX to "" make a change. '' I asked to speak to management because 1. I had been told prior I did not qualify for REPAYE, but was not given any solution ( the solution would have been to switch my XXXX loans from IBR to REPAYE early in the process and avoid "" making a change '' penalties '' ) Additionally, I was told I still needed to send in a self certified letter to qualify for IBR, which I had been stalling on so I could gather all this information and do my own research before finalizing it, after becoming aware of all the "" change '' penalties, and having made the unfortunate discovery that Nelnet servicers would tell me something different every time. So come yesterday, somehow I am fully locked into IBR and will need to pay penalties to switch to REPAYE. If I had been given the correct guidance from the very start there would be no 22k penalty, however 3 different loan servicers lead me to believe that IBR was the only way and i was stuck paying a third the balance on IBR with a wildly snowballing principal. I confirmed this fact w the penultimate phone call and NO ONE EVER SAID, hey wait you will avoid having a huge balance in 25 years if you do REPAYE instead. These people apparently think we are dealign with XXXX money and that it's ok to have people that don't understand finance from a long term standpoint dishing out instructions and advice that have horrible long term consequences. The manager agreed with me that I was not given complete information, but said he could not  reverse the XXXX penalty."

I wish to fight the entry of a default judgment obtained based on lack of notice. service of the summons did not result in actual notice in time to defend the lawsuit, the entry of default was the result of "" mistake, inadvertance, suprise or excusable neglect ''. I reached out to XXXX XXXX the original creditor who stated they do NOT have any pending dues from me there was no debts to them from me. I served this notice to Nelson and Kennard who ignored the letter and now went through with judgement and garnished my bank account where I receive my social security income. I contacted Nelson and Kennard to inform them that my income is except from garnishment and that XXXX XXXX stated in writing that I do not owe them anything .... they AGAIN ignored my request and now froze my accounts. I contacted DAs offices and now preparing my complaint to them will file this week if this is not resolved and lien this false judgement is not released ... 
NELSON AND KENNARD also issued a false statement to XXXX XXXX in their attemps to renew this debt stating that "" LAST PAYMENT WAS RECEIVED ON XX/XX/2017 '' IT IS A LIE, FALSE AND FRAUD. I never made a payment to them this should not be ignored ..."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This complaint is against EXPERIAN LLC.

Since my loan was purchased by loan servicer XXXX XXXX XXXX I have put in requests for updated calculations on the qualifying payments I have made ( in total - including the payments I made to prior servicer XXXX ). Over the course of a year, I have been requesting the updated calculations over the phone at XXXX XXXX XXXX. Beginning in XXXX, I was told that my request had been put in and to wait 30-XXXX days, again in XXXX I was told to wait another 30-60 days. We are now in XXXX and I have not received an updated calculation. As I am now nearing the end of my qualifying period, I require an updated calculation. I am receiving as I type the same information and no movement toward calculation of my remaining qualifying payments. Though I have paid for over 6 years and made all my payments, their online tool and their representatives show I have 110 qualifying payments remaining as though I have *only* paid 10. This is very very very incorrect."

I was trying to retrieve my score and was referred to Transunion website, where I was asked to provide personal details, credit information to create an account. 
After this credit card information window opened, but no amount was shown and I didn't realize I was making a {$20.00} order. I thought it was part of the registration process. 

Minutes later I realized they charged me {$20.00} and customer service at TransUnion was useless and didn't help saying they don'y do refunds even though membership I was tricked to purchase membership I didn't want and ask for 30 minutes ago. 
This is a fraudulent practice by TransUnion who are not being completely honest and explicit for the services they charge."
Mortgage,"I had a tax refund for an over payment of taxes as I was approved for a XXXX exemption for tax year 2017 forward. I requested the mortgage company to provide a letter to allow the refund to come to me directly. They declined to provide even though they are withholding the maximum amount per law according to my calculations. I have called the loan service provider and submitted multiple requests in writing to provide the refund. The loan provider is now holding my refund in escrow and I have been told that I I will not receive a refund as I have not paid yet for this months mortgage. I believe the company is in violation of the law regarding the maximum escrow withholding. I also think their policy to not allow a refund of this nature to go directly to the mortgagee will many times result in a violation of the law in this area. I am only 13 days behind on this loan, it is unacceptable that I was told I would not be refunded monies owed to me because i was not current."

Vehicle loan or lease,Over the past few months GM Financial has not been applying payments made from my financial institution to my account and ultimately have reported inaccurate information on my credit report showing late payment history. I have never been late and it is an internal problem with their company. I have attempted to rectify this on multiple occasions with multiple people at GM Financial and they are unwilling to return phone calls to me when requesting to speak with a supervisor. I have documentation of payment history attached to this complaint. This has negatively impacted my ability to pursue a refinance on my home due to their internal error and negative reporting of payment history on my credit report.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My personal identity was stolen and numerous cards were opened in my name fraudulently without my permission.

At that time someone from the fraud dept told me the accounts were being closed and they were sending me some information w/in 7-10 days. 14 days had passed and I still had not received anything in the mail. I called again and the mngr in the fraud dept told me someone forgot to mail the info out. The next day I received a call from a manager who claimed to be assigned to my case. I could not answer the call and he left a voice msg stating "" the act has been reviewed and they have reached a desiscion '' ( I still have the voicemail ) At that point I immediately called them to complain because they had not sent me 1 letter regarding the fraud and I still had not sent them my police report along with other important information. I spoke to supervisor XXXX in the fraud dept who told me that no one should have contacted me stating that because the acts were still under investigation. I stressed to her that this is ridiculous that someone would call me to tell me this without having any information that I have in my hands. At that time she said that it would take 30-90 days before someone might be assigned to my case and she also stated to not do anything with the act. A few days later I received a notice from XXXX  that my credit score had dropped 81 pts due to being late on a Capital One act. This should not even be on my credit report due to fraud and now it dropped my score 81 pts. I have reached out to Capital One 3 times after this and as of today XX/XX/XXXX I have not heard back.

Vehicle loan or lease,"My USAA member ID is XXXX and I have an auto loan with USAA. Recently in violation of many consumer protection laws, USAA restricted my access to USAA.com and cancelled / closed my credit and banking accounts. This poses a problem as I have never received a billing or account statement in writing from USAA for my auto loan. It was set up to all be completed electronically, were the statements are available on usaa.com and all payments are auto debited from my USAA checking account. <P/>This is an issue as now USAA has closed my checking account, so automatic payments are not possible going forward. I called in to request assistance with this as I do not know the amount, or where to send my car payments to keep it current going forward. I was told automatic payments would be stopped and I 'd begin receiving paper statements. I have to to receive any statements from USAA for my Auto Loan. Most recently I called in today on X/XX/2017 and after being transferred several times I spoke with XXXX. She informed me Paper Statements could and would not be sent to me as I agreed to receive all statements via USAA.com at the load origination and she was unable to change it. I requested the payment amount, address to send it to and billing history be sent to me at my home/billing address. She informed me that could not be done I needed to view it all on USAA.com. This poses a problem as USAA restricted my access to USAA.com making it impossible for me to do. <P/>So now, I am unable to pay for my auto loan, view past payments or even know where or how much to send.

Credit card or prepaid card,"A year ago, on XX/XX/2018, I went to a store to realize that my credit card didn't work. I called the Bank which was Chase and ask about it, the agent told me that all my credit cards from Chase were closed and that no information can be disclosed until I will receive a letter about it. 
I had 5 chase credit card, the Chase Business Ink, the Chase Sapphire Reserve, the Chase Freedom Unlimited, the Chase Hyatt Credit card, and the Chase Ihg credit card. In addition, my wife that was an authorized user on one of my cards, got her only card closed ( the Chase Sapphire Preferred card ). 
Chase claim was that I was requesting too many credit cards in a short time and that was a payment made from another company once. 
Although I had these 5 cards with Chase, they were open over a long period of time ( 4 years ) and they had different purposes. I always paid my bills on time and never had high spending on those cards. My incomes were high enough to justify all the credit limit I had. 
I did pay off once my balance with a check from a company, this was because I had a contract with them and some of my expenses that occurred during my work with them were paid with my personal credit card. It was normal to reimburse these expenses directly from the company 's check. 
I called Chase many time and spoke with many representatives but no one was able to help me with this.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I disputed incorrect information being reported on my credit report by XXXX XXXX, which your company advised is not in your system and could not help me with them. However instead of Transunion performing a complete and accurate investigation, they replied in a couple of days the information was verified as accurate and did not fix the issue. Then, they allowed XXXX  XXXX to report negative information on my account after I had already paid the account off. This information they recently reported on XX/XX/XXXX was never once reported on my credit report by XXXX XXXX prior to my dispute for them to fix the error they were reporting.I did not even complain about the fact I was told the account would be removed once I paid it off, I was trying to have the inaccurate information removed. I believe this was reported by XXXX XXXX as a retaliatory report, and Transunion has not done anything to prohibit this malicious act. I have contacted Transunion 3 times since this change appeared on my credit report, the last contact with them being on XX/XX/XXXX. I have been told three different things by their representatives. First I was told there was no change on my report, then I was told there was an update but that it does not matter because the account is scheduled to be removed in XX/XX/XXXX and then I was told yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) that the report was changed on XX/XX/XXXX and that it does not show a charge off/collection. The representative was rude and did not listen to my information. She just rushed me off the telephone. I was extremely bothered by this because the information XXXX XXXX should not have been allowed to report, as they were reporting inaccurate information and this account should have been deleted, has decreased my credit score and has caused issues with me receiving credit even though I had completely paid the account off in XX/XX/XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am very concerned about the validity and accuracy of the recent investigation done by Transunion.

I have pulled my credit from all 3 credit bureaus and have attached the proof for you to examine that the credit reports are time stamped 31 days after they signed for my letters, and one of the major violations they totally neglected to do is mark my accounts as disputed on my reports and/ respond with court approved documentation within the time frame with verifyible documents that would hold up in court that the debt was in fact my debt. I demand that they remove the debt reporting to my credit report immediately, and that you as well as the attorneys general offices, and XXXX hold them accountable for the noncompliance of these said violations and laws that have been broken. I want them removed, and it is my rights. My letter clearly explained what I would do if they did not respond accordingly. I have a well documented case and have all intentions of taking care of it legally if they do not comply."
Debt collection,"In XX/XX/XXXXI was working for a company and making XXXX a year ; the company folded in the midst of the economy crash and XXXX here in Arizona. I had a couple of credit cards at the time that this happened. I continued to try and pay those cards but eventually I couldn't afford to do that. I stopped making payments and let the cards lay as they may. I had no choice. I didn't want to file bankruptcy but things were aiming that way. When all was said and done I didn't have to file bankruptcy as I only had one company file a judgement against me. 

I contacted the company several times trying to work out a payment arrangement with them but they chose not too do so. They continued the judgement and somehow got it by default. I was never presented with paperwork or anything until after the fact and then it was too late for me to do anything. The judgement was placed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

They then sent a statement to my employer for garnishment. They started receiving garnishment in XX/XX/XXXX. Then about 3 months ago I started thinking that I should have paid that amount off by now. I asked my employer to print off the totals that had been taken from my checks. I then contacted them in XXXX and asked them to send me a complete report of all debits and credits in regards to my account. 

I heard nothing from them at all but coincidentally the very next paycheck their garnishment was stopped from coming out of my paycheck. I then followed up with a request to receive a complete report of all of my credits and debits from my account. They told me that I would have to contact them by phone. I contacted them and they still to date haven't sent me any reports. 

According to my records I have overpaid them and they owe me money. I have read several online reports about them and this seems to be a continuing process. They hire local attorneys to do all of the intimidating paperwork and don't reply or communicate with you until it is too late for you to reply and then take old debts that have gone away and keep them alive."
Debt collection,"I sent a certified letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX on each attempt dated XX/XX/18, and XX/XX/18 to XXXX XXXX XXXX for Validation of the alleged debt that they claim I owe to their company and that is appearing on my credit report. I specifically asked for a signed agreement and other supporting documentation as proof of claim of the accountancy. The request was not adhered to. XXXX XXXX XXXX have been reporting alleged charged off debt to the credit bureaus as verified and I am asking that the alleged account be deleted 30 days has passed each attempt to retrieve the information. The account was never verified nor validated."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX there were 5 fraudulent charges listed as coming from XXXX XXXX XXXX and 1 fraudulent charge on XX/XX/XXXX, also from XXXX XXXX XXXX. For the following amounts to my Citi Premier credit card : XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Bill Payment XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX I have spent many hours reporting this issue to Citi, at least 9 times. 5 phone calls and 4 chat sessions, they have refused to reverse these charges. I have also contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to verify they did not charge my Citi Premier credit card for any of those amounts. 

I can verify that I contacted Citi on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. There were more communications via online chat and another phone as well. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX verified that these charges are fraudulent and a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX spoke with the Citi credit card dispute center on my behalf ( with me on the phone ) and explained to them that these charges are fraudulent. The representative will confirm my claim. 

I can also submit my wireless and internet bills from XXXX XXXX XXXX which will show XXXX XXXX XXXX never charged me any of those amounts, and that XXXX XXXX XXXX does not bill me on the XXXX or XXXX, ever. 

My wireless and internet packages are unlimited ( no data cap ), there is no possible way I could have racked up these charges. 

I will also be filing a complaint with the FTC while looking into a lawsuit."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I initiated a dispute through TransUnion for an item in collection through XXXX XXXX XXXX That debt, assigned XX/XX/XXXX for {$200.00}, is inaccurate. It was paid via XXXX XXXX ending XXXX in the amount of {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I sent the credit card statement showing that charge, which originated from a XXXX visit on the aforementioned date. Numerous attempts to contact that collection agency via phone and traditional mail have proved unsuccessful, which is precisely why I dispute the transaction. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have received no updates or follow up from TransUnion regarding my dispute. Their "" Online Status Checker '' simply states "" n/a '' for estimated completion date and status updated. Obviously more than 30 days have elapsed."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",My credit was used without my permission. This was fraud committed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I did not purchase a car from this car dealership. The dat was XX/XX/2019. The reference number is XXXX. The loan company is GM Financial.
Mortgage,"Rushmore Loan Management, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX all violated my rights by ignoring my requests to validate the debt. I have repeatedly stated that the amount Due is incorrect. By Law I am supposed to receive an explanation of the debt of the payments received when they were applied and where they were applied. I requested it from all of the servicers and from the Law Firm XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. They foreclosed on my home sold it without ever validating the debt and EVERY SERVICER is guilty of Dual Tracking. 

Rushmore states they did not receive a completed modification packet more than 37 days before the sale so the modification was denied. They received the first packet in XXXX and the second on XX/XX/XXXX. The sale was XX/XX/XXXX that is more than the 37 days allowed by Law. 

I repeatedly requested a payoff, according to my Mortgage documents I have up until 5 days before the sale to pay off the mortgage. Rushmore and their Attorneys ignored this repeated request and mailed the payoff XX/XX/XXXX with a letter stating the payoff was good until XX/XX/XXXX. THEY MAKE NO MENTION OF THIS IN THEIR RESPONSE. 

Along with all their other inaccuracies they have repeatedly stated that I filed bankruptcy and no longer owed this debt THAT IS UNTRUE I never had ANY DEBT discharged in Bankruptcy they should review their records for names and addresses on those papers. 

Rushmore also states that I only made one payment on the trial modifications this is also inaccurate along with the dates they state in their letter ( which is all PROOF of how they have tried to defend what they have done with one inaccuracy after another ) had they provided the debt verification I had requested numerous times they would see that the second payments were made but they were placed in a suspense account causing the modification to be considered in default. 

Rushmore also states that I provide no proof of the inaccuracies in payments when I supplied the only debt validation I have received which was a print out from XXXX showing that they received the payments and placed them in suspense took payments then made general ledger adjustments to debit the payments. Had Rushmore bothered to review any of the information they would see how many times they broke the law. 
I HAVE AGAIN ENCLOSED A COPY OF THE RECORDS RECEIVED FROM XXXX REGARDING PAYMENTS AND CHARGES. How this can be perceived as no proof of payments not being applied is inconceivable. Even the Justice department could see the BLATANT misapplication of payments. 

The Justice department has requested and reviewed more information than Rushmore has to investigate what occured with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Rushmore. They have questioned the suspense payments and the overpayments yet Rushmore denies them.

Rushmore is currently seeking to evict me with the proof I have of all the laws they have broken that they choose to ignore the eviction would only add more damages to a lawsuit should they not correct the mistakes they have made along with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a rate lock with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) for a cash-out loan in the amount of {$190000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.375 %. My total closing costs were estimated at {$4700.00} on line D of my Loan Estimate. I locked this rate. 

Shortly after, I was contacted by XXXX with a refinance offer where I would get an initial cash-out refinance, promising a secondary refinance at a sub 4 % rate with a long-term rate lock, and with the secondary loan being of no-cost to me. After some skepticism, I was re-assured that rates were priced through the end of the year since Global is a direct lender who can set their own rates. The no-cost refinance is also advertised on Globals website. I was assured that I would be able to get a 180-day rate locklikely at 3.8 % in XX/XX/XXXX, as soon as I had paid down some of my higher interest student loans ( which was the intention of the refinance ). I cancelled the XXXX loan on XX/XX/XXXX, and have emails and credit card statements supporting both the rate lock and the refund. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a Closing Disclosure with a loan amount of {$190000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.99 % with the Total Loan Costs on line D coming to {$5000.00}. This is the loan that had a closing date of XX/XX/XXXX. It should be clear that I accepted the terms of the XX/XX/XXXX loan because of the promises made for a long term rate lock at a considerably lower rate. 

XXXX did not lock the rate in XX/XX/XXXX, and between XX/XX/XXXXand XX/XX/XXXX I tried to push forward with the secondary loan, during which time lots of back and forth conversation happened. I have texts of correspondence during this time. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX claimed to have locked 4.25 % for 180 days the week prior to our messages, indicating that it should be able to go lower. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reiterated that, worse case scenario we have the XXXX and hoping that we can go lower, specifying that it should be able to get to XXXX. XXXX gave several excuses as to why the loan could not be closed until earliest XX/XX/XXXX, which was news to me but which he should have known the entire time. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX informed me via phone call that the 4.25 % rate lock in XX/XX/XXXX had only been a 30-day lock, and that rates had since gone up and I could no longer get the 4.25 % rate. He said that he would lock a 4.5 % float-down rate at no cost to me, and would get me the paperwork by the end of the week. I had not received any correspondence or paperwork by XX/XX/XXXX, so I called Global and requested to speak to XXXX supervisor, with the intention of requesting a different loan officer. I was transferred to XXXX and left a message, which was never returned. I had requested to switch officers previously when XXXX mentioned that he had personal issues causing delays in correspondence, but he assured me that he could handle it and refused to transfer my account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX the loan was again delayed, which I found out was because XXXX was using my income from XX/XX/XXXX. This income pre-dated our business together, and there is no reason that XXXX should have been using that income. He pulled my credit without getting my permission, without notifying me, and without locking a rate. I was notified of an inquiry by a credit monitoring agency, and called the requester to learn that XXXX had been the one to make the inquiry. He apologized, but could not provide an instance when I gave him permission for the inquiry. I was unpreparednor did I believe it necessary considering his numerous promisesto contact other lenders during the mortgage window. XXXX is now demanding that I produce proof of a lower rate lock in order to honor his original promises. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX claimed to lock at 4.5 %, which I confirmed via text, but which also seemed to be untrue since he is now claiming that 4.625 % is the lowest rate that I can get without additional costs to me Throughout this process XXXX has repeatedly claimed that I would be able to get a sub 4 % rate and also to have locked at 4.25 %, but those claims were untrue. XXXX had also indicated that I could get a float down loan, but that was determined to be untrue without financial costs to me ultimately negating the benefit of a secondary refinance. Now XXXX claims that he is unable to offer the free refinance without a higher interest rate, which has none of the benefit that he reiterated again and again as his selling point in XX/XX/XXXX, and which is not as advertised on Globals website. This situation negates the cost benefit of the refinance and forces me to stay in a loan with a much higher rate that I would have had with my original AIM loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed indicating that a 30-year loan wasnt possibly and that we had discussed that before. I did not recall having discussed that at all, and when questioned about the occasion on which we spoke about it XXXX was suddenly able to get a 30 year loan. He also indicated at that time that a 3.875 % loan was possible with 2 points. This is the loan that I expected, with no points, as per his promise. Such a loan was clearly still possible in XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I finally received a Closing Disclosure with a loan amount of {$200000.00}, with a 30-year fixed rate of 4.375 %. This comes with an additional Loan Cost of {$4400.00}. This represents a total Loan Cost of {$4700.00} + 6-mo in differential interest ( ~ {$600.00} ) more than if I had simply kept the original cash-out loan offer through AIM, which I had cancelled due to Dustins promises. 

In an attempt to remedy the situation, I informed XXXX that I had suffered some fairly straight forward financial losses due to his misunderstanding of rate lock policies and/or inability to lock as promised. I outlined my losses and presented options for correcting the loan, which were in keeping with his many promises, but which he indicated numerous times via email that he has no intentions of doing. XXXX insists on only looking at current market rates, and neglects his original promises that 1 ) I would be able to get a 180 day rate lock in XX/XX/XXXX when rates were considerably lower than they are now, and 2 ) that he has repeatedly assured me that worse case scenario I had a rate of 4.25 % locked."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","A USPS certified receipt mail letter was sent to TransUnion and delivered on Monday, XX/XX/2019 requesting validation of debt from a company called XXXX XXXX. In my request for validation, I reminded TransUnion that in accordance with their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. 1681g the consumer is entitled to said records from said company or agency, the requested  records which prove/show that the debt is indeed mine that were given to Experian to validate this debt. They must in accordance with their obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act 15 U.S.C. 1681i delete this information from my credit report or send me copies of the documents that they have in their files with verifiable proof. I also requested correspondence be in writing. As of today, XX/XX/2019, Experian has not provided me with verifiable proof or copies of the documents used to validate this debt. 

Instead, on XX/XX/2019, the company sent me their investigation results to my dispute stated the information was investigated and that the debt was "" verified '' as accurate ( with no paperwork ). TransUnion is reporting incorrect information and refuses to produce record supporting documentation that any individual to whom gave the information or the documentation itself as requested. Consumer reporting agencies bear the responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all of the accounts they report and their responsibility must consist of more than merely parroting information received from other sources. An investigation that merely shifts the burden back to the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 )."

He confirmed my account was XXXX and on XX/XX/2019 they would be reporting to the collection agencies as they do weekly to update the status of the account.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This morning I was placing credit freezes on my credit reports at XXXX, Experian, & XXXX. I had no problem putting freezes on my report at XXXX and XXXX. Experian did not allow me to place a freeze on my report. Their webpage is confusing and attempt to direct you to a paid service to place a freeze on one 's report. They should be made to make it easy to locate the area for a free credit freeze per the law. 

After I located the correct area to place the freeze and completed the form it took me to another form which stated they were unable to place the freeze and gave me instructions to send them a certified letter to complete the freeze. This is unacceptable. They seem to be making it intentionally difficult to provide this mandated free service. 

When you attempt to call them their system takes you on a multi-minute phone tree which at the end disconnects the line. Unacceptable."

Checking or savings account,"I used Popular Bank XXXX XXXX which is an app to send funds to people directly on XXXX for {XXXX}. I sent the same person for the same amount 2 months prior with no problem. The second time I sent money to the same person in the same manner it went to a person I have no idea who it is. A few days went by and once I realized the person I intended to send the money to did not receive it I called the bank on XX/XX/10. That is when i realized the info of the recipient 's phone number was one digit off. This was really strange because I used the contact in the app to send money before. I didn't input the number manually the second time. They informed me they couldn't do anything that day and to call back the next day. I asked if they could request the transfer back and they said I would have to wait for someone to get back to me. I informed them I believe this was a timely and to see if they could do something! They informed me the fraud department would call me with in 24 to 48 hours. In the mean while the money cleared through a XXXX account. After the second day I called again and they had no addition info. I asked if they could request the transfer back and they said I would have to wait for someone to get back to me. Two days passed with no call back back from anyone. In this time the fraud department contacted the person I attempted to send the money to so they could confirm the transaction and they told him to call XXXX and ask for the money back. I kid you not! They advised him to deal with XXXX directly. It took several days and many phone calls before I could even get an answer on what the possible outcomes could be. Eventually they told me sorry user error. I was appalled on how the situation was handled from the begging. I found the lack of contact and willingness to attempt to help there customer suspicious. No one could give me any information at all.

I made several inquires but was told that interest was satisfied first they would go around and around about I have a 25 year loan and I must pay fro 25 years. I told them that this was a simple interest loan and why was the overage in my payments going to principal? They told me they just pay ahead interest because it is a 25 year loan. They do this to all student loans. This is not right as all student loans are simple interest as with mine as they must follow certain guidelines set forth by the Department of education. As with my loan it states I can pay as much as I want over the minimum payment and this will reduce the length of my loan as overage of my minimum payment will go to principal including no pre-payment penalty I believe this practice is on going with in both Mohela and  XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  in fact I believe they train their customer service agents to convince all borrowers that all we can do is pay ahead  interest.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax, XXXX and XXXX continue to disregard the Federal Laws for Identity Theft. I am personally filing this complaint to you and this is not a credit repair company. a) Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of— (1) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer; (2) a copy of an identity theft report; (3) the identification of such information by the consumer; and (4) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. (b) Notification. A consumer reporting agency shall promptly notify the furnisher of information identified by the consumer under subsection (a) of this section— (1) that the information may be a result of identity theft; (2) that an identity theft report has been filed; (3) that a block has been requested under this section; and (4) of the effective dates of the block. (c) Authority to decline or rescind. (1) In general. A consumer reporting agency may decline to block, or may rescind any block, of information relating to a consumer under this section, if the consumer reporting agency reasonably determines that— (A) the information was blocked in error or a block was requested by the consumer in error; (B) the information was blocked, or a block was requested by the consumer, on the basis of a material misrepresentation of fact by the consumer relevant to the request to block; or (C) the consumer obtained possession of goods, services, or money as a result of the blocked transaction or transactions. (2) Notification to consumer. If a block of information is declined or rescinded under this subsection, the affected consumer shall be notified promptly, in the same manner as consumers are notified of the reinsertion of information under section 1681i (a)(5)(B) of this title. (3) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. (d) Exception for resellers. (1) No reseller file. This section shall not apply to a consumer reporting agency, if the consumer reporting agency— (A) is a reseller; (B) is not, at the time of the request of the consumer under subsection (a) of this section, otherwise furnishing or reselling a consumer report concerning the information identified by the consumer; and (C) informs the consumer, by any means, that the consumer may report the identity theft to the Bureau to obtain consumer information regarding identity theft. (2) Reseller with file. The sole obligation of the consumer reporting agency under this section, with regard to any request of a consumer under this section, shall be to block the consumer report maintained by the consumer reporting agency from any subsequent use, if— (A) the consumer, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, identifies, to a consumer reporting agency, information in the file of the consumer that resulted from identity theft; and (B) the consumer reporting agency is a reseller of the identified information. (3) Notice. In carrying out its obligation under paragraph (2), the reseller shall promptly provide a notice to the consumer of the decision to block the file. Such notice shall contain the name, address, and telephone number of each consumer reporting agency from which the consumer information was obtained for resale. (e) Exception for verification companies. The provisions of this section do not apply to a check services company, acting as such, which issues authorizations for the purpose of approving or processing negotiable instruments, electronic fund transfers, or similar methods of payments, except that, beginning 4 business days after receipt of information described in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (a) of this section, a check services company shall not report to a national consumer reporting agency described in section 1681a (p) of this title, any information identified in the subject identity theft report as resulting from identity theft. (f) Access to blocked information by law enforcement agencies. No provision of this section shall be construed as requiring a consumer reporting agency to prevent a Federal, State, or local law enforcement agency from accessing blocked information in a consumer file to which the agency could otherwise obtain access under this subchapter."
Debt collection,"Complaint for attempts to collect fees paid at time of rendering services by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( several years of attempts! ) After being bombarded with collection agency notices for five separate {$30.00} fees from nearly a decade ago ( total {$150.00} - {$180.00} ), I contacted the company and told them these fees / debt was paid at the time of services being rendered. The attempts to collect increased as they did not even attempt to appear to verify my assertions that these were paid at time of rendering. The attempts by XXXX, a debt collection agency, increased and now phone calls were added. I dug through my old records and found the appropriate records of these payments. I next contacted the medical facility were the services were given and fees paid for by myself. This required over an hour of digging through records, organizing them and contacting the provider, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( now operating as XXXX XXXX ) spending nearly a quarter hour with them and their many, many phone transfers, delays and more as they tried to find someone who would address my situation. I was able to eventually speak to someone in accounts that had relevance to my collection harassment basis. I cleared up the matter and emailed/faxed copies of my payment receipts from the dates noted for "" collection. '' They agreed these records show the payments their records failed to reflect. Their records were flawed, not my payments. Fortunately, I keep records or I would have no evidence of payment. Their collection attempts began again in a most harassing manner. I have had to put several hours into dealing with their incompetency in record keeping and the average person would have to pay them again and again for the same debt. They appear to use old debts that are difficult to validate payments and insists they have not been paid. Their repeated efforts, even after proven paid, indicates a nefarious behavior on the part of the collection agency, or worse, or a callous indifference to the public at the least. Their incompetency has cost my several thousand dollars in lost time, and untold costs for their repeated efforts based on incompetent records, all of which hyper inflates health care cost in this microcosm, multiplied nationally and were talking $ billions and hundreds of thousand son people losing time, personal or productive, It is their time, it is my time. <P/>When a company continues to harass a patient for fees long paid, something is terribly wrong with the administration all the way to the proles blindly making debt assertions, damaging the public and the individual, this time it is me."

Student loan,"My previous complaint number is : XXXX A Navient Representative called me and was very pleasant. However, the name and number of the representative is not in my daytimer as I was driving when she called. My request was quite simple : Send me paperwork to begin my repayments. This has not been done. Instead what I received via email [ which I DO NOT WANT ] is a generic email entitle "" What We Talked About Today '' but does not really delineate the actual conversation. Subsequent to that I receive another generic letter stating that I could go online and download paperwork for loan repayments or I could call a voice automated system and request paperwork. Voice automated systems do not understand my voice. What I want is very simple : A. If Navient needs to call me DO NOT CALL BETWEEN XXXX AND XXXX CST. Again, DO NOT CALL BETWEEN XXXX AND XXXX CST -- what is so difficult to understand about this request? B. Send me paperwork to fill out to begin repayment? Why can this not occur?"

Student loan,"At the beginning of XXXX, 2017, I emailed fedloan requesting a payoff for a direct parent plus loan as I needed to pay off the loan in order to close on a mortgage. I did not receive a response. I called to request the amount one week later. No response. I called the third week in XXXX and finally received the payoff amount of {$3000.00}. I brought this amount to the closing table with the loan payoff details. I verified with closing agent the check was sent overnight. Fedloan did not put the money toward the payoff. I called in XXXX and was told a request would be sent reapply the amount to payoff the direct parent plus loan. In XXXX I called again to request the amount be applied to pay off the parent plus loan. I was first told it should have already been done and would now only take @ 24-48 hours. I then asked who regulated fedloan and was sent to a supervisor. The supervisor stated it would take 7-15 days. All communication for requests could only be sent via email. No one could talk to those that process the requests. During this whole time I monitored my fedloan page for any upcoming payments. Balance was always XXXX. XXXX 2017 would have been my first month coming out of grace period. It has been my experience in the past if I made a large payment over what was due the balance was always XXXX. Now that the payment has finally been processed to pay off the parent plus loan my fedloan page is stating I am past due on payments. States I have not made a payment since XXXX 2017. I made a payment of {$420.00} XX/XX/XXXX. Now it states I am late and have a past due amount of {$930.00} yet still have a XXXX balance due for XXXX. It seems to me this fedloan unethically tries to take advantage of me by putting my payments where ever is the best interest for it 's bottom line. I feel as if I am at a disadvantage and am vulnerable to a loan shark. It took months to resolve this issue and now they are hitting me with past due interest for retaliation for me paying off the parent plus loan. I have always paid off education loans quicker than the designated time frame. My payoff history shows the proof. Now, looking back in my fedloan inbox I see a response stating the payoff was insufficient and my repayment terms have changed. It seems my statement that I would file a formal complaint to who ever regulates them changed their mind and they applied the pay off to the parent plus loan. Now, they have added unrealistic additional interest charges. American students of higher education beware of fedlaon!"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Here is the situation I have my wife as an authorized signature on a couple of my accounts. The problem is she is just that an authorized signature. Now when we pulled up her credit reports these accounts show up on her report. Now when I signed her up I never gave any information on her social security number nor did they ask for it. Why do they have the right to put that on her credit report without a social security number? So if that is true then anyone in the world can put her name as a authorized signature and it will show up on her report and you would n't know unless you pull up your reports. This to me is a invasion of privacy and should not be allowed unless the primary person puts a social security number down. What is the fix to using an authorized signature.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My wife and I leased XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for {$68000.00} after XXXX rebates and all other incentives from the dealer. The lease was financed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX AZ. We also put {$5000.00} cash for down payment. Due to medical financial hardship ( son diagnosed with stage XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX ) we contacted XXXX XXXX to do voluntary early termination and return the vehicle. They agreed without any early termination fee and told us to return the vehicle to the original dealer. After handing over the vehicle on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the inspection was done while I waited, once the inspection was all completed. The vehicle return manager made me sign a Vehicle Return Notification ( similar to a contract ) with all the breakdown of mileage, accounting etc. and total Charges of {$31000.00}. ( see attached ). Sometime between XXXX and XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX sold the vehicle in auction for {$51000.00}. In XXXX, XXXX, XXXX started sending us bill for {$11000.00}. I contacted them several times finally, I got someone that could tell me about the sale amount of the vehicle. I requested the receipt of sale, which I got in mail for {$51000.00}, we were not notified about the sale until we requested for. I told XXXX that we made 7 payments all before due date amounting {$6700.00} or more, plus {$5000.00} down which they have record of. And asked them since, they sold the vehicle for {$51000.00} and we only owed the {$31000.00} to refund us the difference. If they took fair market approach, then the vehicle sold for more, and if I kept the vehicle for 39 months I would have paid them {$37000.00} per contract after all wear and tear. After 39 months they would have not got approx. {$64000.00}, what they got now.

I demanded that they fix this issue immediately. For almost 2 weeks I received the run around from multiple people ( mainly XXXX and XXXX ).  They did n't know how to fix this and kept telling me they will look into it and call me back but they never called back. Finally, after contacting their supervisor, XXXX XXXX, I was given a letter stating it was entirely their mistake.I submitted this letter to the credit reporting companies in hopes to fix my reports and have the inquiries removed. They requested a police report as well to show this action was fraudulently done. I supplied them with this as well. To date, I am still trying to get these inquiries removed. It has dropped my score dramatically. I was told by XXXX that they recommend XXXX XXXX to correct this issue. I guess they gave my information to them because a couple of days later I was contacted by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX required me to pay for their services even though his entire situation was NOT my fault. I declined their offer for services. I should not have to pay for something that is n't my fault.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Equifax, and XXXX, have all reduced my credit score to absolute XXXX, from a score of XXXX, while also removing nearly all of my account payment History. The XXXX score would have been higher, if four erroneous delinquent accounts, had been detected sooner, and properly dis-positioned. The delinquent accounts were removed, with an accurate reflection of all other accounts, showing a history of timely payments, that would entail a favorable score, beyond XXXX. Afterwards, I continued paying all of my bills in a timely manner, approximately 6 months from the time of the originating event. Being that securing an employment position with a specific company, requires a favorable credit score, I performed a recent score check, expecting to see an improvement from the previous one of XXXX.

I had also discovered that nearly all of my timely payment History was removed, where it had all been previously available for review. I took notice of a type written statement under the XXXX  score, "" that it takes time to build good credit ''. where beneath this, were credit card advertisements prompting me to begin building my credit from XXXX, by securing one of the credit card selections. I called and spoke to all credit reporting agencies, as to why my score was reduced to absolute XXXX. They all claimed that paying utility bills, along with other debt obligations in a timely manner, would not have any impact on how my credit score was calculated, although that is what my entire credit score History is comprised of, and was reflected in my account activity, prior to nearly all of it being removed. I was told that my credit rating was reduced to absolute XXXX, because I did not have a line of credit opened, with a merchant account with any financial institution. I explained that I have never had any type of credit card, mortgage, student loan, or secured loan from any financial institution or lender, and that my entire score has always been based upon timely payment History, with Utility providers, and Land lords. I again was told that this is not how credit scores are accurately calculated, and that I needed to begin building a stable credit History, by opening a line of credit, with securing a credit card from a major financial institution. I informed all of the credit reporting agencies, that reducing my score to XXXX, is completely fraudulent and extortion, for them to falsely coerce me into securing a credit card, for the purpose of building my credit score, starting from absolute XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","A few months ago, I closed a credit card that had a {$500.00} limit. I wanted to boost my credit score, but even though I paid on time it only improved my score by a few points. Since the card service was charging me a {$35.00} annual fee, I decided to close it. Unfortunately, this move dropped my credit score 29 points! I went from having an average score to poor. I feel like I am being held hostage by my credit score and reporting policies. I feel these scores and practices are designed to keep a person down. Now I will pay more in interest rates if I want to buy a home, a car, or choose to get another credit card. This is very unfair and I don't think I'm the only person who shares my perspective. I shouldn't have to open and juggle several credit cards to have a decent credit score."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am having a problem with Equifax taking a charge off from XXXX XXXX off of my credit report. The account is not mine and I have never done business with them ever. They are located in Tennessee and that is where my son 's ex wife lives and she has gotten money in my name and has done this several times as we had no idea about it until she left and went back to Tennessee. We are still paying the price for what she did when she was married to him and taking our social security numbers and other forms of ID to get money in our names. I am sick and tired of trying to get this removed from my credit report and would appreciate some help with this. Thank you for your time and for the help in getting this issue resolved. I have contacted Equifax numerous times to get it removed and they refuse to do so. I don't have a phone number to call them at or I would be on the phone with them already and get this taken care of. I know they have had a security breach but that should have already been fixed and yet I am still having to fight with them to get this taken off. I would appreciate any help you can give me on this. Thank you again and I hope this time will be the last time I have to deal with this.

Checking or savings account,"Over the past three years, I have repeatedly tried to get my ex-husband, XXXX XXXX, removed from my checking/debit account and my credit card account through PNC Bank. I opened this account and credit line as a single individual, and at no time, listed him as part of the account or listed him as an emergency contact. For some reason, PNC has been unable to explain why he has been linked to my accounts. 

Over the past three years, XXXX XXXX has received account notifications as well as account alerts when there is suspected fraud ( i.e., if I am traveling out of the country ). At each occurrence ( the last at the end of XXXX and is noted on my account records at PNC ), I have contacted PNC Bank and they assure me that his name and access has been removed, but then I find out he has been contacted again by PNC regarding "" fraud '' on my account -- which also gives him PRIVATE information regarding financial transactions as well as my locations. 

This occurred again today, XX/XX/XXXX. He was called by PNC regarding a "" Fraudulent Purchase '' on my debit card. When I contacted PNC, they stated they saw that I had called in XXXX regarding the same issue, but "" nobody followed through on making sure it had been dealt with. '' And then stated it appeared he had access via my ONLINE banking. 

Again, I have NEVER linked his name to this account. I have NEVER granted him access to my account. I have NEVER agreed that he should receive PRIVATE information regarding my account. 

I need action taken immediately on this and I believe I should be given financial compensation for illegal sharing of my private banking information. My divorce was not amicable, and I have no idea how much of my financial information my ex-husband has been able to access."

Mortgage,"OUr company borrowed a loan from the hardmoney lender XXXX XXXX for {$150000.00}. The loan rate was 12 %. The loan was foreclosed on because they did not continue the direct charge to the account provided. Upon realizing that the payments were delinquent, we asked them to allow us to catch up. They declined and foreclosed on us. We sold the house. Upon closing they charged us an additional 15 %. They instructed our buyer not to pay any additional funds. They would not close unless we pay the additional 15 %. 
According to florida statute 687 the limit total rate is 18 %. We were already paying 12 % and then we had to add another 15 %. Also the law states that 5 % is the maximum late fee so the 15 % additional charge is unfair. 
We had to agree to the rate because we would have lost the seller. They also would not close unless we signed documents agreeing to these terms. The closing statement sent to us before closing did not include these fees. The final closing statement adjusted the amounts. We were unaware of the hike in fees until then. There was so much deceit."

They will not post the documents on the online system neither will they provide the information on line. When I contacted them for the documents they stated that because I am in litigation with them they have to go through their attorneys to process the request. This has resulted in me being late filing my taxes and subject to late fees and penalties with IRS.     In addition, the litigation has been going since the beginning of  XXXX  and I can not get them to address my complaint about the failure for them to post my mortgage payments and interest correctly while in bankruptcy. At the beginning of bankruptcy, I owed them $  XXXX  and at the end of bankruptcy, I owed them $  XXXX  plus an additional  XXXX  for other fees. The payments made are not properly reflected over the time period.     The agreement we made under the bankruptcy was to pay {$2900.00} months during the bankruptcy period to cover what I owed. However the payment history reflected an amount of {$3500.00} being constantly billed to my account. If this is the amount that I should have been paying then why did they make the agreement in court that the amount of {$2900.00} would satisfy my loan.     No principal payments were posted in  XXXX  and  XXXX  ... .the {$2900.00} is not reflected in the totals of the escrow and interest amounts. Where is this money reflected in payment history!!!!!!     The next issue is that the principal balance as of  XXXX / XXXX / XXXX  was {$340000.00}. Then the payment history for  XXXX  show a balance of {$400000.00} but they send a document wanting me to sign saying we owe $  XXXX . So, they are not holding to the agreement that our {$2900.00} payments are satisfying the loan. They have increased the interest under their agreement and not letting us know that the amount has increased and we need to make the {$3500.00} payment. They have breached their contract of the {$2900.00}. Then they do n't give us documents to support the interest paid for IRS. requirements.     Their practices are not fair!!! and they do n't want to pay my attorney fee but provide me with  XXXX  that do n't meet the attorney fees and additional trustee fees, and IRS fees that I now owe due to them not settling the matter in adequate time.     Overtime they correct the payment history the amounts change to fit the bank. See all the documents that I have submitted with changes they posted to payment histories. Thanks."
Student loan,"In efforts to have made payments on my student loans and having a degree that I can not use, I would like to petition my student loan debt. 

Having attempted several different times to take care of the student loan debt I incurred to obtain a degree I can not use, I am petitioning to have my student loans cancelled, forgiven, and or discharged. 

It is my understanding that XXXX has been under investigation for several issued and I believe that XXXX not only failed to provide proper counselling to me on the student loan debt I incurred but that they also contributed to the amount I owe by charging loans to me that I did not authorize. I am seeking relief from this debt as I have been unable to pay due to the many factors I explained above.

My loans was supposed to be consolidated but yet I still get bills from multiple places and the total is over {$100000.00}. I have read many articles that XXXX would take out loans under the students names to pay the schools debt.

On a follow-up inquiry, I found that the loan servicers had, somehow, obtained an outdated address and financial information on me ( over 25 years old ) even though the address on my actual student loan documentation is current. This makes me believe that the third-party servicers are data-mining XXXX student profiles to bait and then disqualify loan forgiveness applicants so that the servicer can then charge the Department of Education additional fees for servicing a second-tier application process for loan forgiveness based on XXXX. When I contacted the loan servicer, on 3 subsequent phone calls, the customer contact representatives could not provide an appeal form on the original application and did not understand the significance of an application date as being the true end date."

The companies are as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX XXXX XXXX, date XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX via XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX ; and XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Again, permission was not given to the companies listed above by me or my wife and I just do n't understand how they are getting our/my credit information w/out our expressed permission. 

I have tried calling the companies but am told I have to contact the credit reporting agency about this, the credit agencies in turn do nothing and have no way of filing a completed dispute form just for this issue. I 've called the reporting agencies and I 've filed in writing the problem w/these companies yet the problem continues. 

If you would please tell me what I need to do to get this information removed from my credit report as well as my wife 's and/or if you could please check into this so we can correct our credit reports w/out all the inquiries it would be appreciated. At this point, I/we simply do not know what to do but definitely want to file a complaint against the above listed credit companies as well as the companies looking into our credit w/out any permission from either myself or my wife. I ca n't imagine we are the only people w/this type of problem and a solution must be found to be able to correct any inquiry problems consumers find in their reports. 

Thank you for any and all help you can provide in this matter and I look forward to your response and/or advise in this matter.

My Loan matures XX/XX/XXXX After I made my XXXX payment, I notice on my account on-line that 1.My escrow  had decreased and 2. There were some additional charges to my loan. I called XXXX and talked to customer service and address the issues with my loan. I was told that they had paid my my personal property tax out of my escrow early on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I then began to discuss the extra XXXX in fees that were on my loan. She said that she couldn't tell me why I was being charged Legal Fees Due XXXX Other Fees Due XXXX and Late Fees Due XXXX. I told her I did not incur XXXX in late fees on this loan. I also told her my loan had never been modified or ever been in no foreclosure. She then stated that I would have to talk to somebody in another department. So on XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Fay Servicing telling me that they were taking over the loan with 2 payments left. So I started addressing the same issues with him. He said they had just got the loan from XXXX and he could could only tell me that my principal balance was XXXX. I just wan na know why am I being charged these bogus charges. What Attorney charged us XXXX, Why am I being charged XXXX for other charges, and statements showing XXXX in late fees for this loan. 
Finally I find it kind of hard to believe that Fay servicing sent this same loan over to XXXX with over XXXX of bogus interest and principal balance that I disputed XXXX of XXXX which was adjusted.

Checking or savings account,"I received letters from the risk management dept of Wells Fargo telling me they were closing all my accounts. my 2 business accounts, my business savings, my 2 business lines of credit, my 2 personal accounts, my personal savings, my personal credit card, my personal line of credit, ALL my accounts. I have been a loyal customer of Wells Fargo for 34 years and all my accounts were in good standing. I thought this had to be a mistake so I spent endless hours on the phone talking to supervisor after supervisor seeking higher authority asking them to please correct this or give me an explanation. No matter who I spoke with all they said was it was a business decision and they don't have to give me a reason. This caused me thousands of dollars of my time and has caused me so much stress trying to seek answers and spending endless hours on the phone and searching for a new banking institution, setting up all my account, bill pay, ACH withdrawels, etc. My business is complex and this caused me at least 2 months of my time and the stress has been overwhelming. I even went in to the local branch and the manager could not give me any answers as they have no authority and I suppose if they stuck their neck out too far they would get fired. Wells Fargo is a Dirty bank that abuses their customers because they can get away with it. This has affected my credit score because of them closing my credit card and credit lines. I owe a balance on 2 of my business lines of credit totaling {$150000.00} and they are telling me because they are closed I need to pay them in full and they can not restructure them into a simple interest loan. They turned me over to their small business collections and offered me to pay 60 % of the loan and they would write it the rest off but it would affect my credit score. I can not come up with that kind of money nor do I want to harm my credit score. They have put me in difficult position along with the many hours, money and stress that comes with it. Last month I saw a few articles regarding Wells Fargo closing peoples accounts that shouldn't have been closed. A year ago we refinanced a home though a broker and Wells Fargo bought the mortgage. This last XX/XX/XXXX we moved and bought a home and Wells Fargo bought that mortgage so we are good enough for them to buy our mortgages but they cancel all my other accounts? This company needs to be accountable for their actions. I have attached some of the letters I received from them cancelling our accounts. Thank you, XXXX XXXX"

I STRESS BEFORE I even RECEIVED the card in the mail I received an email from XXXX XXXX and it said I needed to Update my credit card and it gave me the last four digits of my NEW credit card. 

I contacted XXXX asked how they received the card number and I think they said it was given to them. I then contacted XXXX XXXX and they told that if I have a subscription the Credit card reporting companies automatically GIVE OUT the card number to those places. 

I feel I SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE TO GIVE OUT MY NUMBER. Please STOP THIS Practice. this most likely how my card has been getting into the wrong hands. 

They also pull the credit card reports by ADDRESS and not by NAME and ADDRESS. As in My mom would get a credit report and it would have MY cards, my brothers cards my sisters card and my fathers. We would all have to say which was ours then have them remove them, At first they also used the FULL NUMBER on the credit card. NOW they always say never give out your credit card info to people you do not know. When I filed that complaint they woke up only a LITTLE they kept all the cards on the report but now they only have the last 4 digits. 

LOOK into that also to make sure they refine how the credit card report is pulled so only my moms cards are on her report. 

Look into all the credit reporting companies I do not know who handed out my info.

Student loan,"I have been attempting to contact XXXX  for years for them to look into an issue with my balance. When my loan was first turned over to them I was making a monthly payment of {$42.00} which would be $ XXXX/annually. I then started making $ XXXX/Mth payments for a total of XXXX/annually. After I refused to pay them until the issue was resolved, they began calling my ex husband and giving personal information to him to collect a balance. This information was used against me in a custody battle. I have spoke to two different people within the last few years, both of whom told me there was an issue with the balance and that the payments I was making were not being deducted from the balance. I paid $ XXXX/mth for a year and they only deducted $ XXXX/annually from the balance. I was told this would be adjusted and fixed so that I could pay off the entire balance. At this point I put my account on a forbearance, since this was what I was told I had to do until the issue was resolved. I will make a one time payment XXXX  to close this account but will not make any more payments towards the current balance of XXXX. They refuse to look into this issue and return calls or emails and continue to request money. As you can see on the attached spreadsheet, the amounts never went down, they continued to increase and payments were not deducted."

XXXX XXXX XXXX said, An unfair law is no law at all its that unfairness which certain aspects are reported while others omitted, its unnecessary complex.

Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX, VA. I was softly in the market for a new car. I found a vehicle I was interested in, and a salesman pressured me into seeing if I could get approved for financing. I live on a fixed, SSI XXXX income so I was concerned about over-extending myself. They got me approved for financing, but I was still skeptical due to the high monthly payments. It was a Saturday, so the salesmen told me I could take the care home and see how I liked it. By Sunday morning, I knew this was something that I didn't want to do. First thing Monday morning ( the XXXX ), I returned the vehicle to XXXX XXXX. The manager and salesmen were very angry with me, and told me I had to take the car. I told them that I had the right of rescission, and was well within my rights to return the vehicle and change my mind. After all, because it was the weekend, the paperwork had not even been sent to the finance company yet. I left the vehicle at the dealership in their possession. I assumed the issue was resolved at that point. Over the next several days, I was overwhelmed with phone calls from reps at XXXX XXXX   saying that I had to come back to the dealership and pick up the car. I held steadfast, and told them that I had changed my mind, and did not want it. I had returned the car to the dealership within 36 hours and was well within my rights to do so. Again, I believe the issue to be resolved. To my surprise, the dealership actually delivered their car to my house on XX/XX/XXXX. I called the sheriff 's office about this, and asked them what I should do. They told me I should just take it back again, if I did not want it ; and that's what I did. I returned the vehicle again ( that same day ) and left it in their possession. Again, I thought the issue was resolved. Recently, I received a letter from a finance company called Santander talking about my interest rate on a car loan. I had no idea what this was about. I called them, and sure enough, this was for the car from XXXX XXXX. I explained the whole situation with the rep at the finance company, and they said they would make sure it was resolved. So despite returning the vehicle to the dealership before they even submitted the finance paperwork, and them knowing I did not want the car, the submitted the financing paperwork anyway. I can't believe the lengths that this dealership would go to try to force someone to buy a car they clearly did not want."

Vehicle loan or lease,"We obtained a boat loan in XX/XX/XXXX thru XXXX XXXX based in XXXX, TX who is now defunct. The loan was transferred to Volvo Car Finance North America. The loan was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, I need to sell or give the boat and trailer to charity and need a clear title to the trailer.The Virginia DMV will not give me a clear title because the title is registered to XXXX. I have called the XXXX number listed on a bill from XX/XX/XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX and have not gotten any results. Volvo will give me a no interest letter, but it does not explain how Volvo obtained the loan and where is XXXX. DMV will not give me a title without that explanation & Volvo refuses to do so. They claim they never heard of XXXX, do n't know how they got the loan ... But we paid our money to XXXX for years, so obviously if we had been in default they would have found a title to sell it with. My last 2 contacts in XX/XX/XXXX have been with a XXXX and a XXXX at the phone number listed on the bill. Every time I call I may get a call center in Tennessee or Nebraska. I spoke to those 2 in Tennessee because the 2 release letters I did get were from the address listed in complaint form. The following is what the VA DMV needs for me to get the title '' Submit evidence to DMV that a lien release can not be obtained from the lienholder due to the lender going out of business, merging with, or being taken over by another business, along with evidence that the lien has been satisfied. Evidence of lien satisfaction may include, but is not limited to the following : For lenders that are merged with, or taken over by another company/corporation/or lender, customer must include a lien release for the vehicle from the company/corporation/or lender with whom merged and supporting documentation linking the original lienholder with the merged or takeover lender. "" DMV further explained : "" Volvo Car Finance should be able to provide documentation of when they took over the lien or when they merged with the old lienholder or bought the company. If they ca n't provide that documentation, have them provide you a signed and dated letter on company letterhead stating that they are unable to provide the documentation of when or how the lien was acquired ''. My problem is that Volvo refuses to explain this. I can call them and give them the VIN number, my name & address and without so much as batting an eye, they will give me a release letter. How can they do that without knowing if they have a vested interest in the boat? But to get them to write how they acquired the loan, etc, they will not do. I have faxed to XXXX my supporting letter, my trailer registration, and a copy of the monthly bill from XX/XX/XXXX. That last occurred on XX/XX/XXXX to the fax number XXXX. I have heard nothing from XXXX or XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. I need that title to the trailer as I am moving and wish to sell it or give it to charity. It has to move.

I have been complaining to Equifax and the CFPB about this matter for almost a year, but nothing has been done. 

Upon information and belief, no one from Equifax has taken accountability for my credit disputes, therefore no one from Equifax can testify in court against me. 

Is it going to take millions of Americans to start submitting certified/notarized/sworn Affidavits of dispute, that would be filed with massive Federal Class Action complaints, to get Equifax to adhere to the law? Clearly, Equifax does not complete reasonable dispute investigations for consumers. From my personal experience, Equifax conducts investigations based on hearsay, which should cost them billions in Fair Credit Reporting Act violation fines and punitive damages. 

I have been advised to provide Equifax and the CFPB with this Affidavit included in this complaint and wait for a response from Equifax. This CFPB complaint, all responses, both prior and present, documents, this Affidavit and possibly the Affidavits of others will be submitted to a consumer attorney in the event I become the lead Plaintiff in a Class Action suit against Equifax to claim damages for myself as well as millions of Americans who have been affected by Equifaxs FCRA violations.

Acme representatives have been extremely rude and have even resulted to sending me letters making false accusations with ALL CAPITAL LETTERS which seems a very aggressive form of communication. When I ask who the original creditor is and for them to verify the account is or was mine previously I am directed to multiple agencies and circled back around. In more detail I am told by Acme I need to contact the previous collection agency for any billing questions and when I do that I am routed rightfully back to Acme because the previous agency is not the current or active agent for trying to collect some debt no one can verify or show physical proof of. The company has threatened to take legal and credit reporting actions against me without proper cause or resolving or addressing anything to do with the bill itself allegedly claiming this is a debt in which I have occurred I haves sent several letters to the company including certified request and still the company refuses to address the verification of the bill. I informed them If this was from a particular incident that I would be more than willing to provide them with the insurance I had at the time if there was somehow some billing error and the insurance company was not billed but the company has refused to take the opportunity to resolve as the many other attempts I have made. The company has also falsified the address to which they have mailed documentation to me. I feel they have purposely sent mail to the wrong address to falsely warrant evidence of them sending documentations to me. The only reason I received one particular letter is because a neighbor I knew hand delivered it to me.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My complaint is about the overall scam of credit bureau reporting. 

Can someone explain to me why having someone check my credit lowers my score? Does it mean Im likely to miss a payment? Does it mean Im about to overextend myself? Does it have anything to do with all of the hundreds of creditors Ive paid in full over 30+ years of having credit cards, student loans, mortgages, or other types of reported debt? 

No it doesnt. So why is the score impacted? 

Credit reporting bureaus having massive differences in scores??? Why?? 

Why do only 2 agencies show up on the scores? XXXX  and Equifax? What happened to XXXX?? 

Credit reporting also different for differing situations? Why is my score different for credit card application, home loan info, auto loan? There should be one score and one score only!!!! The score I see should be the same one a creditor sees. 

Its like the housing market scam network in this stupid country. Why is there a different appraisal price for 1 ) purchase, 2 ) refi, 3 ) just a personal I want to see what my house is worth ( this always confuses the appraisers ), or 4 ) a relocation appraisal. Why are they all different? Its the same # % *ing house XXXX!! 

Credit bureaus are the same scam. Why is what I get as a consumer so different than what a bank sees??? 

It is so disgusting and fraudulent."

Told them I was on the No Call List and wanted no further calls. Was told they were calling about my loan application and would need last XXXX of my SSN to pull ; advised I did n't have an application so my SSN would do them no good. Advised they could use my phone number to remove from their call list and any further representation that I had a loan application was fraudulent. Since that XXXX conversation I have received XXXX more hang up calls. I also received XXXX messages left from the same company on a toll free # XXXX, ignored the XXXX thinking it in error, the XXXX came in on XXXX, my conversation with the rep XXXX went much the same as my original conversation, with them insisting they needed SSN info to stop calls ; thus far I have not received further calls from this number- yet. I believe this particularly egregious phishing may have been triggered by my recent HARP process with my bank as I 've gotten a number of mail offers since then, but these folks just wo n't stop even after I told them I was a XXXX ( in credit & collections, no less ) and I worry that given the list the calls are apparently are being generated from they may take XXXX of someone who is at their most vernarable."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","After separation from my ex-husband, and subsequent divorce, I came to find out that I was still listed on our joint bank account and the balance had fallen into the negative. The negative balance associated with this account was well over {$1000.00}. I was fully unaware of the negative status of this account, and certainly had no idea that it had been charged off. I am still unsure of how it is legal for a bank to allow such an excessive charge to pass through, when there is no money in said account. In the terms of our divorce decree, it is stipulated that any and all debts incurred during the time of our legal separation are the financial responsibility of the party who acquired them. These charges were incurred solely by my ex-husband, and the bank associate even confirmed that it was clear to her, that the only debit card in use was his own personal card. Mine was entirely inactive. Even after calling in and pleading my case with the bank and offering to provide proof in the form of divorce documents, there was no consideration made to removing me from the liability of this debt. This debt affects me in two critical ways : I am unable to obtain any new bank accounts in the future until this debt is fully paid, and secondly, it is strongly impacting my credit score in a negative way. As a now single mother, I simply can not afford to pay for the gross financial irresponsibility of my ex-husband. That being the case, I feel XXXX should reconsider my request to remove my financial liability from this account, and the continuing mark on my credit, and be satisfied in pursuing XXXX XXXX for his debt."

We agreed to applying since it would afford us time to pay the amount and we would also get our order by the beginning of summer. Unfortunately the total for the supplies maxed the credit limit on both my card and my husbands. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I both received a letter from Synchrony Bank indicating our accounts were closed due to few commercial financial accounts and few open commercial credit card accounts. 

This is very unfortunate as we never indicated to the sales person we were contractors or professional commercial builders. This credit card was recommended by that sales person and never advised us there was a possibility it could be closed in the near future for these reasons. 

Upon calling Synchrony Bank Lowes and speaking to a supervisor we were advised there was nothing they could do and recommended we apply for the Lowes Advantage credit card. 

I informed the supervisor how is that fair when we applied in XXXX and why was it approved if the credit report showed no commercial accounts. We no feel we were approved just to get is to make the purchase snd now we are locked into paying this money and the interest if we fail to payoff before the promotional period.

XXXX contends and reports that the account was included in a bankruptcy filing, thus reporting the account as a negative or derogatory mark/tradeline on my consumer credit reports, however this is in fact, untrue. The account that I held with XXXX was in good standing and maintained a zero balance from the date that it was opened until the date it was closed by the creditor. The account was not discharged or even included in the Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy I filed as there was never any debt to discharge. As I have previously disputed this account with the Credit Reporting Agencies, some of them have deemed any further disputes erroneously as frivolous due to XXXX 's insistence that they are accurately reporting, therefore precluding me from any further disputes of that information. The account was closed by XXXX unilaterally and should be reported solely as closed by grantor, without any negative remarks or connotations that cause it to be classified as a derogatory account which can negatively impact my credit score.

Debt collection,"On Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX, I was notified by my bank that a hold/freeze was placed on my account. I was given a phone number to contact ( which was to XXXX, XXXX & XXXX XXXX, XXXX ), but not given any specifics as to why the funds were on hold, but that there was only a legal hold and that my bank must honor it. All of the funds in my account were placed on hold and I am still currently unable to access any of them. This includes funds I need to pay for child support as well as my rent and life saving medication. It is important to note that I have never been in contact or received any communication from this firm. I currently reside in New Jersey and the firm operates and somehow obtained a Judgment against me in Pennsylvania. I contacted the firm immediately to discuss the file. I was given no details as to my account and was told that I must give them my full social security number in order for them to look up my account. Having no choice, I agreed to their demands. They located my account and gave me an office file number. I was then transferred to a department and was promised that if it went to voice mail that I would be called back immediately. I called the office twice each day for 4 days. Each time I was told that no one was available to take my call and each time I was transferred to a voice mail. In the interim I did some research as to what had happened with my account. A judgment had been filed on XXXX and was subsequently entered against me on XXXX. There is no information regarding service of the Summons and Complaint ( I have attached the court paperwork. At the District Court level is always available on the website ) When I inquired with the court as to the service, they would not give me the specifics as to the service, but that it had allegedly occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, which would be on a Sunday, and 2 days after the Judgment had been entered. I again reiterate that I live in NJ and did not receive any of this paperwork that was allegedly sent almost a year ago. I also finally was able to find out on my own that this was for a Discover Bank file. The office has not given me any information as to the account, including balance owed, date of charge off or any other information. I have not received a letter of acknowledgment as of yet that is supposed to be sent ( In accordance with the FDCPA ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally able to speak with attorney XXXX XXXX with the firm. He did not provide me with any account information as to what their office was collecting for or any information as to the status of my case. I was not given the XXXX in any of my communications with the firm, including when attorney XXXX XXXX spoke candidly about my account information. Other than in my original communication with the office did they confirm any right party contact information. I was never asked my name in any calls, despite them speaking candidly about my account and actions taken. When speaking with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX on XXXX, I informed him of the situation regarding me never receiving documentation, and living out of state. I also explained that that I believed the Judgment was invalid as service was not made prior to Judgment being entered. If I was in fact served, I would have not had a chance to respond accordingly. XXXX understood the situation and stated that he or someone in his office would contact the court and call me back promptly. I advised that I needed to have this resolved today as I have had no of my funds available now for 4 days. He vowed to look into it and have someone reach back out immediately. I did not receive any calls from them after that. I called their office back at XXXX XXXX on XXXX. I again spoke with XXXX and asked for an update. He advised me that he never reached out to the court. He also stated he did not know how much was on hold, but they were proceeding and that I could file whatever paperwork I deemed necessary. I again reminded him that they had never contacted me and advised him that I believe that they are trying to collect on an invalid Judgment and possibly the wrong person. He did not seem to pay any mind to that and said they intend to proceed. I asked if there was any other way we could resolve this and he declined. As a final note, I was never made aware if this firm had been recording my calls. If they were I would not have spoken with them and specifically not given my social security number over the phone with them. In Pennsylvania the opposing party must advise and confirm that the other party is ok with the call being recorded."
Credit card or prepaid card,"XXXX  credit card did not post my payment to my account in XX/XX/2018. I am unable to access my account online due to their system issues and they will not send me a paper copy of statements nor the letters related to the dispute, acknowledgement of proof of payment, findings of the dispute, the payment posting nor the amended reporting to the credit agencies due to XXXX not posting my payment. I was verbally told in XXXX that the dispute was resolved in my favor and I continuously call requesting and demanding MAILED copies of every letter related to this transaction and I have yet to receive one piece of mail OR a mailed statement which I have asked to receive the mailed letters numerous times. 

I just want these letters.This is a traumatic frustrating experience that has caused me so much stress. I do not understand why I can not receive the information that is mine and to obtain information to ensure my credit is appropriately restored and reported I have informed d, I very with the post office and not one piece of correspondence has been received at the post office"

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have a Synchrony Bank "" CareCredit Card. '' This card offers a deferred period where if paid by a certain date, you will not pay interest. If not paid by this date, interest will be accrued retroactively to the date of purchase. 

In this particular instance, I had 2 separate transactions on 2 separate dates. However, they both had the same promotional deadline of XX/XX/19. The oldest of the 2 was the largest and all payments made were applied to this transaction until the last two payment, Synchrony then applied the last 2 to the second purchase. This left a balance on the larger purchase ... effectively making me responsible for the retroactive interest that was the highest. 

After over an hour on the phone and having to exert much force, Synchrony rectified this. They told me that this was done for my benefit since it appeared that I would not have the larger balance paid off, it was better to at least pay off the smaller of the two. I don't buy this for a minute and feel that this is a very underhanded tactic to extract the most interest possible. I only caught this when I went on line to see the balance that was remaining on the larger purchase, as I have every intent to satisfy this balance by the deadline. 

I think the actions of Synchrony is criminal and should be investigated!"

Debt collection,"I am writing to file a formal complaint against Midland Funding LLC. for predatory collection practices, collecting funds from me and using personal data to dig up more charge off debts to keep extorting payment with ill obtained false judgements with court insiders. 
Facts : Midland Funding LLC. Has used predatory collection tactics, against me to obtain default judgements and then force payments. They have used the legal system to threaten, and they act like they were doing me a favor by offering me a reduced payment on me to pay for 2 credit cards with XXXX that had already been charge off accounts by XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I did not know any better and just gave them a pre authorized check that I honestly thought I was curing my last credit cards that had gone bad due to unemployment. But I believed them and I thought this was better then filing bankruptcy and I even have letter that shows they were settled. In XXXX I received a call about new default judgement and I hit the roof. I wrote to them and disputed the charges. Yet to no avail. I have disputed the debt but they know the people in the court so this time I was at my worse financially. I did not think they would obtain anything, because sadly I have been financially insolvent, barely making enough to pay rent, food even with food stamps, student status because I could not get any jobs due to the judgements against me, coupled with anxiety and could not get over so much loss/crisis. Yet this company is thriving by abusing families, they got a default judgement without properly notifying me or PROVIDING PROOF OF THE DEBT. They have lawyers, clerks and people working the system. They act with no regard or fear of being checked, because they know I don't even have the money to pay for a lawyer or the filing fee. This is a disgrace, that I go to the court and I can't do anything. Today I thought I would reach out to your group in hopes for justice. Here are the details : Case Midland Vs. XXXX XXXX Original Creditor is XXXX-XXXX  : ending XXXX Acct opened XXXX Date Account Charged off : XX/XX/XXXX Default Judgement : {$2500.00} On XX/XX/XXXX I requested SUBSTANTIATION PROOF OF DEBT received no response from them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX. I Received a ( NOTICE OF LEVY- ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGEMENT ) copy of a recently court filing form EJ-150 of the same judgement but now it is for $ XXXX-READS notice of Execution of Money File XXXX-original court case XXXX. 

They know I live in XXXX, they have my address because it arrived. Yet they Filed in XXXX Courthouse XXXX XXXX XXXX. with signed levying officers listed as County Sheriff Civil Division XXXX by XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX registered process server. 

I made the mistake of paying them for two credit cards, XXXX XXXXXXXX that went into charge off status due to loss of employment, loss foreclosure of my home in XXXX in XXXX. At that point, I was doing my best to settle things with creditors because I was in financial crisis. I wrote to all my creditors ( attached letters ) directly and paid the credit cards I owed by making direct settlements with credit cards companies. 

I also did a Died in Lieu of Foreclosure with XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, they agreed to charge off the XXXX   XXXXfirst loan, {$53000.00} for second loan and one final remaining credit card with XXXX, it is noted on my credit report ( see recent credit report attached ). They consequently denied this agreement and turned it into a foreclosure but gave me charge offs on all the debt due to the HARP guidelines. My credit was ruined, XXXX XXXX filed a Judgement and I paid, Midland Funding found a way to squeeze out {$2000.00} out of my promising that they would not file judgements against me, they claimed they had been hired by my credit card companies. I did not know any better so I paid them. ( I can provide checks once I get from bank ). 

I wrote letters to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, to get my final relocation {$1500.00} but no luck. I was stuck in a rural area now, no job and in XXXX when they sent me a letter to pay the above credit debt, I demanded proof. I had after all lost my dignity, job, all my 401k, filed for unemployment, forced to apply for welfare to survive. I did not think moving to XXXX XXXX with {$1500.00} of the original deal to keep only one house would have been possible ; but a Lawyer from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX assisted me. I tried to apply for similar jobs, and could not obtain employment, filed for Welfare, became financially insolvent, have lost everything and have no money for anyone to levy ; not even me. I have been working for the last 5 years barely providing basic needs for my XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX, XXXX ; I have gotten divorce and on XX/XX/XXXX I received a copy of a "" Money Levy from Midland Funding. '' They should not be allowed to operate in this manner. 

I looked through my papers and it turns out that I have paid them over {$2000.00} and received a letter regarding the Judgement in question. As I had suspected, I settled two of the credit cards with them for XXXX and XXXX again two different credit cards. They now want to squeeze more blood, but there is nothing left. 

They have gone out and purchased some OLD CHARGED OFF debt from XXXX XXXX after they promised that they would not file DEROGATORY legal judgements against me. WRONG, Midland Funding LLC, lied they are experts at their craft. 

They intimidated me in to paying the two previous debts which were probably not even valid and now they are coming after me again. This is unfair and they deserve to be held accountable by someone. 

I do not owe Midland Funding or have a credit card contract with their client XXXX   They were not able to validate the debt, and when I refused to be taken advantage again, because my credit was still showing all those judgements plus a foreclosure, they decided to pay the courts to obtain a default judgement in XXXX. Both cities that they have contacts, with the people there facilitate their paper filings. 

In addition, I have called them and disputed these charges repeatedly over the phone, in writing but they will not stop filing more forms with the court, harrasing me, using the courts to bring a judgement on a debt they have no proof I owe them. 

I have copies of the settlement letters from them, I went into default on my credit cards, and later experienced more financial hardship ; I took responsibility for my wrongs. I have paid my DEBTS, it has been 5 years of ABSOLUTE XXXX, crisis and this company is ruthless they will not leave me alone. They deserve to be fined themselves for the tactics they use with the courts to obtain wage garnishments for debt that has been charged off. 

I request that they be investigated, prosecuted themselves because I have no powe4r against them. I went to my local court and asked them for help on this and have tried to go to the XXXX XXXX XXXX Self help but they say I need to go to XXXX California which is 12 hours south of here. This is EGREGIOUS behavior! 

Moreover, I pulled my credit report as a result of this and during the time period they claim this debt is from is too old. It is not listed as one of my accounts. I also have copies of the settlement letters I wrote to ( my creditors see attached ). I have also kept copies of the letters that Midland sent me with copies of credit cards that had already gone to judgement but they told me they ha settled accounts I had with them. They obviously had my address, contact but they failed to communicate because they knew they had the judgement, which was easier then to verify the debt because they do not have a way to pull the original contract. 

I know I have made some mistakes dealing with credit, but did the best given my situation to settle and make workouts. Life happens to all of us. I am not a crook. It has been years of trying very hard to survive, living below poverty level, using free, donated items, getting mental health, and now after 5 years this company is coming to garnish my wages because they were given a default judgement with no proof of the debt. This is unfair and I implore you do something about this this company, they are a cancer, they need to be investigated and stopped. How can they get these default judgements, abuse working citizens and make money? Who are they paying to process these documents without proof of the these old charged off debt?

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I was advised to contact you all regarding two items on my credit that is not mine XXXX XXXX  and XXXX. I reached out the my local police department and the FTC. I really need help to get these items off my credit report.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was sent a debt forgiveness offer by XXXX XXXX XXXX via mail, I emailed the company to verify if the offer was still available, the offer was : To pay "" special offer balance '' of {$2000.00} and my account will be marked paid in full. The company confirmed that the offer was available and provided an address to send the check. I sent a check of {$2000.00} first, then {$26.00} totaling in {$2000.00} in XXXX of 2019. This was a cashiers check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
After paying the balance I waited a month and the company did not update my credit report. I emailed them and they said they would contact Experian but nothing changed. I then filed a dispute with Experian by speaking with a representative over the phone, I also sent the letter that was sent by XXXX XXXX XXXX and a copy of the checks sent. 
Experian completed the dispute as "" remains the same ''. I called again, to find out why it was not updated. Experian Rep. explained that it can not be removed and my dispute was to have this item removed. Me and XXXX XXXX XXXX have communicated via email and telephone that the item ( Charge Off ) can not be removed but should be marked paid in full in accordance with the Debt Forgiveness Offer. After verifying again with XXXX XXXX XXXX, it seems as though we are on the same page and Experian is not updating my credit report. I filed another dispute in XXXX and the dispute came back again "" remains the same '' showing that the balance was still {$2000.00} instead of {$2000.00} and not marked paid in full.

On XX/XX/2019 XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with 3 letters per account which did not address my concerns with the inaccurateinvalid information reporting on my credit reports. In addition to not addressing my concerns, the company referred to me under an incorrect name. Despite me giving them the name XXXX XXXX in my request they addressed the letter to a XXXX XXXX.

Checking or savings account,"Im totally frustrated with my service with TD. They have constantly XXXX me over. I tried to activate a new card I received from them and told the card was invalid.

Trust me I dont forget the XXXX  you guys taken from me putting my account in negative for 3 weeks. A dispute I know i did not do."
Mortgage,"In XXXX, I got behind on my mortgage after I had an unforeseen expense : my uncle was murdered, and I had to cover funeral expenses. I was sued in foreclosure. With assistance from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), I submitted a loan modification application to counsel for the foreclosure plaintiff, Bayview, on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, an employee of counsel for Bayview sent  XXXX an email confirming receipt of the application but stating that I am not eligible for a modification due to file [ sic ] having 3 or more prior modifications on the loan. 
The same day, XXXX requested documentation showing the 3 or more prior modifications. After several days, counsel for Bayview provided documentation of five prior modifications. An employee of Bayviews law firm noted that after my loan was modified three times, an additional modification was approved after investor exception was granted. The investor, according to the law firm employee, is XXXX XXXX ; the employee provided a link to the online XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The link did not identify any particular part of Users Guide relating to the number of modifications XXXX XXXX permits ; nonetheless, a search of the Users Guide reveals that XXXX XXXX provides that servicers may ask XXXX XXXX for permission to modify a loan that has been modified three or more times, and explains how to do this. 
In a mandatory court-mediated settlement conference on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX asked that Bayview request from XXXX XXXX an exception to the three-modification cap ( as Bayviews own documents show had been done in the past, with XXXX XXXX acceding to its request ). The court referee presiding over the conference directed Bayviews counsel to provide documentation, at the subsequent conference, of its request to XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX response. 
Despite the courts clear directive, Bayviews counsel did not provide any documentation of its request to XXXX XXXX for an exception, or of XXXX XXXX response. In a letter emailed to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, Bayviews counsel stated conclusorily that an exception request was submitted to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, a decision from the investor was received advising the waiver request was denied. ( See appended copy of XX/XX/XXXX letter. ) XXXX responded by pointing out that the response did not satisfy the courts directive, but Bayviews counsel did not reply or provide any further detail. 
However, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, to my surprise and relief, Bayview offered me a trial modification. ( See appended copy of XX/XX/XXXX trial offer. ) I made a timely trial payment to Bayview in  acceptance of the offer, as expressly contemplated by the terms of the offer. I was elated to have been offered the opportunity to save the home that I live in with my fianc and children. The first trial payment I sent to Bayview was debited from my bank account. 
Then, although Bayview had accepted my payment, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, Bayview sent me a refund check and informed me in writing that the trial offer had been made in error. ( See appended copy of XX/XX/XXXX letter and copy of refund check. ) Between the time that I accepted the trial modification offerwhich, by its terms, required only that I make three timely trial payments in order to successfully complete the trialand receiving Bayviews purported withdrawal of the accepted offer, I reasonably relied upon the offer by spending money on repairs to my home. If I had not received the offer and accepted its terms, which are affordable to me, I would not have made the repairs : until I received the offer, I feared that I would not be able to keep my home in light of the pending foreclosure and the prior modification denial."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is a complaint about my payments to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX MA. At the end of the year they went back and applied all my payments that were only a couple weeks late to my upcoming payment, making it look like I had missed my XXXX payments.

So for example my payment is due on the XXXX of every month. In XXXX. My check was sent XX/XX/XXXX and was cashed XX/XX/19. Then in XXXX I sent it 2 weeks late and they didnt cash it until XX/XX/19. But that is still within the 30 days. They applied this payment to my XXXX bill early and reported to credit that I missed my XXXX payment. UNACCEPTABLE.

Debt collection,"I was contacted by Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. this company on XX/XX/2019 called to collect two debts that were supposedly owed by me.The first account was for {$290.00} and the second account was {$700.00} I asked the customer service representative what address did they have on file for the debts. The address he provided was inaccurate and i had never live there before. He explained that i could dispute the accounts due to no knowledge or evidence at the present time to state the proof. He then proceeded to state that he has to read out a disclaimer stating the process of the dispusting of the account ; the creditor can not sue the consumer for the so called debt. 
After a little over a month, On XX/XX/2019, I received in the mail a letter from the debt collector showing how only one of the accounts was valid and accurate. In the envelope there was copies of bills that were sent to the inaccurate address that was on file. That is not accurate proof to show that I owe a debt. Portfolio Recovery Associates is to provide a copy of signed with signature, contract or agreement. Failure to show accuracy of the event has resoluted me to file a complaint against the company. Also. there was no valid validation stating that the other account was mine, either."

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/2019, a man calling himself XXXX XXXX emailed me about an online ad I responded to advertising a studio sublet. We communicated by email and spoke on the phone several times. He shared pictures of the apartment and knew a lot of details about the property, which I checked out online. Due to circumstances, I had to rent a place to live for two months while in another state. 

On XX/XX/2019, I sent him {$2300.00} via XXXX through my Bank of America account. He asked me to send it to XXXX XXXX at XXXX. After the payment, he stopped responding to my texts or phone calls. I realized I was scammed. 

On XX/XX/2019, I filed a claim with Bank of America. They said it would take a week or two for them to make a determination on whether they could refund my money. They also said it wasn't a case of fraud even though this man lied, cheated and never had an apartment to rent because, they said - get this - I sent him the money. I filed a report on the FBI website XXXX.

That same day, I file a second claim through Bank of America, with info from the police report and contact information for the leasing company that manages the apartment. By then, I'd gotten in touch with them to notify them of the scam. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America to find out what the decision was on my second request. I was informed over the phone that they also rejected this request. The reason, I was told, was because the "" costumer '' had closed their account. I said obviously they would close the account because they are XXXX. They didn't send me a letter to notify me of this decision. The tone from the person on the phone was utterly heartless. 

I am so incredibly disappointed with Bank of America. I have been a costumer since the XXXX and they actually helped this person to steal my money. Look at the news, which reports these scams are rampant with the help of XXXX. Most banks refund their customers ' money while Bank of America helps these XXXX get away scot free.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Citi Cards Account Number XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I have attempted to resolve the debt with Citi Cards since XXXX. Please see previous case numbers XXXX and XXXX. 

The initial debt was with Citi Cards. I failed to make payments due to unemployment, and the account was transferred to XXXX XXXX. Prior to the account being transferred to XXXX Once, I attempted to contact Citi Cards to resolve a modified payment arrangement due to my employment status. A representative, XXXX, instructed me there was no record of my account. The account was transferred to a third party. He provided the account would be transferred back to Citi Cards after the account was brought current. I contacted XXXX XXXX and provided payment in the sum of XXXX to bring the account current. The next payment was not due until the XXXX. A representative, XXXX, contacted me prior to the XXXX and attempted to collect additional monies. I instated I would not make another payment until the due date. XXXX incited to begin using derogatory remarks and comments related to my refusal to pay the debt. I terminated the phone call and contacted Citi Cards to report the incident. A representative from Citi Cards provided they were not able to provide any plan of action based on the remarks of the representative from XXXX XXXX. I provided information to the representative related to my payment to bring the account current. The representative provided the account was still being held by XXXX XXXX. Citi Cards was unable to resolve the issue of harassment ; therefore, I filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ). The incident report numbers for Citi Cards and XXXX XXXX are detailed above. I contacted XXXX XXXX on the XXXX to provide the next payment. I was told the party assigned to my account was out sick. A phone call was returned, and the supervisor informed me the assigned representative was no longer employed with XXXX XXXX. He continued to share they received information related to my complaint to CFPB ), and they would no longer be able to work with me or accept payments. The supervisor provided the account was being transferred back to Citi Cards. Following, this conversation, I began to make payments online to Citi Cards. In XX/XX/XXXX, I included the account into debt consolidation as the account was current. I proceeded to make monthly payments. The balance has been reduced from over 5,000 to approximately XXXX. A copy of my credit report was retrieved to review the progress of the debt management program. I noted Citi Cards reported the account to all three credit bureaus as a charge off. I never received communication-related to the debt being transferred to a charge off account. This was unannounced to me pending the review of my credit report. Also, this was not indicative in XX/XX/XXXX when the account was entered into the debt consolidation program. The account was current as of XX/XX/XXXX, and it is being paid in full. The account was NOT settled for a lesser amount than what was owed. I have contacted Citi Cards approximately five times to resolve the issue of the reporting. The last call was on XXXX. A representative, XXXX, informed me the account was listed as a charge-off in XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards began to accept payments from the debt consolidation company in XX/XX/XXXX. Citi Cards incited this action, enlisting the account as a charge-off, after receiving initial contact from the debt management agency. I questioned why I didn't receive notification and expressed concern as the card was current. Payments were made through XXXX XXXX and online with Citi Cards. XXXX communicated he was unable to help me or reverse the charge off. The charge-off was unfairly reported on my credit report. I have attempted to resolve issues with payment and recording through Citi Cards related to this account since XXXX. Documentation can be noted in the complaint based though CFPB. Citi Cards has been unwilling to determine the following : why I did not receive communication about the status of the account being changed to charge-off ; why the account status was changed to a charge-off account after the account was brought current ; documentation of payments from XXXX XXXX, and rationale for unfair/inaccurate reporting to the three credit bureaus. The account was brought current in XXXX. Moreover, the account is being paying in full. The reporting of a charge-off has and will continue to have a negative impact on my credit score. 

In correspondence provided by Citi Cards on XXXX, they recognized the unprofessional behavior by the XXXX XXXX employee and resolved I would continue to make payments to XXXX XXXX until the account was paid in full. However, XXXX XXXX informed me they would no longer accept payments from my following my complaint to CFPB. XXXX XXXX instructed me to resume payment to Citi Cards. I resumed payments online. 

The discontinuity of communication between the creditor ( Citi Cards ) and debt collector ( XXXX XXXX ) has caused undue stress. In addition, the inconsistencies in receipt of payment possible contributed to errors in crediting payments to my account during the transitions of the account from Citi Cards to XXXX XXXX and back from XXXX to Citi Cards again. In turn, this contributed to inaccuracies being reported to the three credit bureaus. 

I have attempted for more than two years to rectify the error in reporting or changing the account to a charge-off status. The account was closed by the creditor while it was in current status. Also, the account is being paid in full. There was NO settlement agreement for the due amount."

We contacted our bank ( Bank of America ) on XX/XX/2019 to report the fraud/transaction. The fraud department is not open on weekends and therefore B of A is saying that our claim was not entered into their system until that Monday XX/XX/2019 and that they could not stop the transaction. Bank of America is saying that they have closed our claim based on their investigation, but has failed as of today to send the information used to come to this conclusion to us the customer when we requested it be overnighted to us via XXXX or XXXX on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX."

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","On XX/XX/2019 I mailed a cashier 's check. # XXXX for {$19000.00} to XXXX XXXX, overnighted by XXXX. I received a call from a XXXX XXXX representative on XX/XX/XXXX stating they received the cashier 's check ; however, I had an additional {$550.00} in property taxes that needed to be paid ( which was totally unexpected ) but I paid online through my Michigan XXXX XXXX XXXX bank account the same day. Now after this payment they said that I would have to wait up to 15 days to receive my title in the mail. Well that date would've been XX/XX/XXXX. Yesterday I received a call from XXXX XXXX and the representative asked had I decided what I wanted to do about the vehicle? Did I want to turn in the lease or did I want to purchase vehicle? Needless to say, I was flabbergasted. I told her I had already purchased the vehicle. Then asked her does she not see the funds on my account? She indicated seeing the {$550.00} for property taxes posted but she did not see the cashier 's check payment of {$19000.00} posted to my account. So after going back and forth with her I hung up and called my bank. Michigan XXXX sent me over a document proving that the cashier 's check had been reconciled as of XX/XX/XXXX. So I called back, spoke to a finance supervisor and told her that I have been given a copy of the endorsed check by my bank noting it was cashed XX/XX/XXXX. She said that I should fax it over and they'll try to find the monies. I did that. Well then they said they had posted it to the wrong account and now they're going to correct the matter. But since payment is going to post after XX/XX/XXXX now I have an additional {$21.00} to pay.? XXXX $! Grudgently, I went online to pay that. Today, XX/XX/XXXX they're saying it still hasn't posted to the account. Once payment posts to the account then 5 to 7 business days after they can close the account. Once account has been closed then wait up to 15 days to receive my title in the mail. Nothing else I could do about it but wait. I have a problem that wait. I have a problem with the fact that I had to pay the extra {$21.00}. I have a problem with the unexpected required payment of {$550.00} in property taxes. I have a problem with them mishandling my {$19000.00}. I only have one account so how was it even applied to another account if not one of mine. The finance supervisor insisted no way to get immediate assistance and there's no one I can talk to in the accounting department. Which is the dept that is now going to finalize my account but won't handle it expediently. So this is my complaint and it's outrageous, unprofessional and unacceptable. What can I do about this? I need to have my issue resolved. Someone should be able to help. Pay, wait, pay, wait, pay, wait and wait some more is not working for me. I have other business pending that I can't move forward with until I get the lien release from XXXX XXXX. Please help me!!!"

Since then I've made 3-4 email attempts to speak with someone about this issue with no response I've also requested the rest of my money that is left in my XXXX account but the only response that I received was that my account was closed due to the dispute I made withy bank.

I have received no reply from them, also I did receive confirmation via certified mail that they did receive my letter on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX. Also they should also be aware that if they report such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX SSN : XXXX | DOB : XX/XX/XXXX Experian XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX I am outraged that your company continues to maintain a dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy as confirmed on my credit report. This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third party system known as a XXXX XXXX. The XXXX XXXX is inaccurate and incomplete since the XXXX XXXX does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. 

Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy.

Considering this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate an updated copy of my credit report showing no bankruptcy within two weeks from the date you receive this letter.

Credit card or prepaid card,"After a few months, I tried login into my credit card online account to make a payment. The username and password I entered was correct but it asked my for a second verification step which was getting a code through the phone. Despite trying a few times, I never got that automated phone call. The following day, I tried to resolve the issue through a different way, calling costumer service. I figured maybe the phone number Citi had on record was wrong so I tried to get them to change it and send me a verification code to the correct number and then be able to log in and operate my service. Trying to get that done involved speaking with the automated voice 4 times and then speaking to around 10 people both in English and in XXXX and repeating the same information over and over. I was told twice that my correct phone number needed to be verified so the representative would end the call and call me back right away at the correct cell number I provided. In both of those occasions, I did not get that promised phone call. After around 80 minutes trying to resolve the issue I was unable to get any effective support so I made one last phone call to request my card being cancelled. The operator asked me if I wanted email confirmation of the cancellation and I said yes but I havent got it after several minutes although he told me my request had been confirmed. I am seriously disappointed with Citi 's costumer service."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","what the XXXX is going on? on XX/XX/2021.

I was told that the FCRA obligates you to investigate these negative items within 30 days and remove them if nothing is found, but it has been over a month now, and your inaccurate reporting still affects my credit nor get any response. Apparently, you are ignoring my disputes. I demand these accounts be deleted immediately or I will file for litigation due to all the troubles. My information was impacted by Equifax data breach and may got into hands of the wrong person and its your obligation to fix all these errors."
Mortgage,"I am in the process of fixing my home after a hail storm. So far I have replaced the roof, the siding, and am in the process of replacing a bay window. My loan provider ( loancare ) has consistently failed to notify me of evolving requirements of theirs, and has had otherwise non-existent communication aside from periodic threatening letters, which I brought to their attention. I have not had a late payment since purchasing my home in 2003. They failed to notify me of a requirement of theirs that I provide a release of lien, a W9, and a signed contract. They say once the account goes over $ 20k this is required, however, when speaking with a representative two days prior, I was assured all I had to do was send in the check with the loan number affixed. After sending all of the required documents, they then told me I needed to endorse the check prior  to sending it, and they returned the check to me unsigned. At no point was I told to endorse the check, in fact I was advised earlier not to endorse the check for safety reasons. Also, the office they list in CO claims they do not have access to any information, and are solely for debt collection. This is misleading to say the least. These are but a handful of issues I have had with this company, and I am concerned with my ability to fulfill my obligation to complete work on my house in a timely manner when I am met with such dysfunction."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a credit card with Barclays. The dispute came from fees they assessed against my account. I always pay my bill in full, and they suddenly charged over {$50.00} in interest one month. I discovered later that they did this because they accidentally posted a payment on my account, and they charged me interest for three months from the time they posted the payment until they discovered the error. During these 3 months, I had been paying the full amount on my bill by the due date. 

When I discovered Barclays ' error, I made the payment in the amount that they had posted, but I contested the amount of interest because it was not my fault. I received 3 standard responses that "" We are unable to complete your request. '' I stopped using my Barclays credit card, started making arrangements to get a new credit card, and I used {$75.00} in "" rewards '' to reduce my balance. Then, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that stated that they had posted {$29.00} in "" interest charge-purchases '' on my account on XX/XX/XXXX. The amount was the balance on my account, not the fees/interest that Barclays had charged on my account. Regardless, upon receiving that letter, I wrote a check in amount of {$29.00}, returned my credit card, and asked them to close my account, with the hope that I would no longer deal with Barclays. 

Since then, I have continued to received bills from Barclays. Apparently, they are charging a fee over {$20.00} per month on an account that has been closed and paid in full. In XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a letter to explain that they had not properly investigated my dispute, and that I should get a refund instead of bills. I received no response. Instead, I received a new statement in the amount of {$41.00}. 

I am writing to complain that Barclays ( 1 ) failed to investigate a dispute as required by the Truth in Lending Act, and ( 2 ) continued to charge fees on a closed account that has been paid in full. 

I am attaching my correspondence with Barclays regarding this matter. Thank you for any assistance you could provide."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been in USA two times as XXXX XXXX ( summer work and travel program ) .My first trip was from XX/XX/XXXX till XXXX XXXX.During first trip I opened XXXX XXXX XXXX checking account and close it right before I left a country at XXXX XXXX.Second trip was from XX/XX/XXXX till XXXX XXXX.During second trip I opened a XXXX XXXX checking account and close it right before I left a country at XXXX XXXX.From XX/XX/XXXX till XX/XX/XXXX I lived in XXXX. When I came into the USA at XX/XX/XXXX I went to XXXX XXXX bank to renew/reopen my checking account. The banking clerk told me that she cant open for me regular account because of my bad credit history, she opened for my opportunity ( limited ) checking account and suggest to check all my information within credit bureaus. I was shocked because I have never applied for any credit lines/loans/credit cards in the Unites States until XX/XX/XXXX. After a few months, I found out information about credit reports/score/credit history. I log in to XXXX and XXXX XXXX to check information under my SSN and find out numerous accounts under my name which was opened when I even didnt have a visa to the USA. Those accounts were opened within XXXX years when I lived in XXXX and dont even think about the USA. So, this complaint is about Citi bank account ending XXXX which was open ( according to XXXX credit report ) XX/XX/XXXX with a credit limit XXXX $ and current balance XXXX $ ( XXXX ). I have never applied for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX received and never use ANY of CITI credit cards. I physically lived in XXXX-it 's no way for me to used this card."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/19 I made an error that has now caused my funds deposited on XX/XX/19 to be frozen for 10 days. 

I inadvertently transferred money from one account to another, only problem is I to the to and from backwards. As soon as I hit the OK button I realized what I had done. I called Wells Fargo to see what my options were. 

My options were to put a {$31.00} stop payment on the transfer, which didn't make sense because I don't have {$31.00} to spare. Well the XXXX transfer out of my checking from the other account hit so I called to see if we could do an {$18.00} reversal, it was an error on my part, however ; it happened. 

This error has sense caused my checking account to accrue 6 or more overdrafts which now Wells Fargo put a 10 day hold on a deposit that I depend on to pay my bills, get medications, doctors appointments. 

I have explained to Wells Fargo that I am XXXX, do XXXX to try and offset some of my expenses until Social Security makes their decision. 

I have set a lot of bills to be paid automtically, hence the Overdrafts. Once I received the email that they were holding my funds. I called and explained to them I am XXXX and need those funds for XXXX purposes and Bills. 

Being continually penalized {$32.00} for bills that I have set to pay automatically, while the money is there I find ridiculous. 

They have told me once the hold comes off they can give me partial credit for the overdrafts. That is not going to help someone is XXXX and unable to make a living."

Attached is a copy of my most recent mortgage statement dated XX/XX/2019 which references a reinstatement amount. ( Attached - PDF Reference 1 ) I have the ability and am prepared to make such payment in a single installment to being this loan current, although such action requires an updated quote from you. ( Attached PDF - Reference 2 ) Additionally, the mortgage statement makes reference that this amount consists of unpaid advance disbursements but does not fully itemize these amounts. ( Attached PDF - Reference 3 ) This property was subject of a foreclosure sale by Sale Committee on XX/XX/2019, although the report of the Committee has not been marked for judicial consideration ( potential approval ) until XX/XX/2019. 

Finally, there appear to be irregularities in the conduct of your legal counsel within this process with respect to Connecticut General Statue 49-31s regarding the concurrent filing of motions for default and judgment upon non-appearing parties. 

Such concurrent filings might be permitted for instances of abandoned or unoccupied residential buildings, however despite the repeated placement of "" XXXX - Vacant '' stickers on an accessory ( storage/garage ) building on the property, there seems to exist no other evidence or rationale to think that this single family home actively occupied by the mortgagor ( me ) had somehow become abandoned property. 

Given the deficiencies in service and process upon me which resulted from this ( apparently ) erroneous application of the accelerated timeline, I ask for ability to reinstate this loan and request such calculation of the reinstatement payment amount in accordance with Connecticut General Statue 49-10a. 

Such payment would be made direct to your organization in single installment within 3 business days of receipt. Please provide wire transfer information ( or alternate remittance instructions ) in your response. Thank you.."

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I have an unsecured consolidation loan w/ Citizens bank that was opened in the last 2 years for $ XXXX w/ $ XXXXpayment w/ my wife as a cosigner. This loan was initially and has always been serviced by XXXX XXXX. It was setup w/ a direct debit ( ACH ) from my savings account and for the first year or so was paid as agreed. In XX/XX/XXXX I sold a truck which had a $ XXXXpayment and in XX/XX/XXXX my wifes car w/ a $ XXXX/payment will be paid off. During XXXX we had some insufficient funds transactions that resulted in ACH missed payments. The relationship between Citizens and XXXX was always confused. There were times when I would return a call from Citizens & or XXXX to make a payment after a missed ACH and they would tell me the loan was current. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I called Citizens Bank/XXXX & spk w/ XXXX XXXX to make a payment and start the process of getting caught up. She advised me the account had charged off and I need to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX. I advised I was not comfortable dealing w/ a third-party debt collector and wish to pay Citizens bank directly she couldnt accept my payment. She stated the loan was charge off on XX/XX/XXXX by Citizens and that was early because the loan had not yet reach 120 days past due, and she suggested that we bring on XXXX. I agreed and she joined XXXX/XXXX ph # XXXX, who said the charge off was authorized by Citizens bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX officially sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and that I needed to speak w/ them. I again expressed that I wasnt comfortable dealing w/ a third-party collection agency, but still XXXX couldnt help me. She did say another collections department at Citizens may be of assistance at XXXX. I then asked to speak w/ a manager at Citizens bank and XXXX brought on Manager XXXX , but he refused my payment, I asked for his supervisor and was told that person couldnt come to the phone, but they could have them call me w/ in 72 hours. I have received no return call as of XX/XX/XXXX. To all three individuals I expressed all of the above of about freeing up cash flow and I was prepared to bring this loan current in short order and honor the term of the original loan and that my loan be reinstated as only 7 days had passed since the charge, again XXXX refused my payment and told me I had to deal w/ XXXX XXXX XXXX ph # XXXX and that Citizens nor XXXX could assist me further. I then called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the representative stated I needed to settle the $ XXXX balance w/ them and suggested that I settle for an immediate {$12000.00} payment. I advised I couldnt pay that and wouldnt be doing so soon, the representative chuckled and said well that might be your opinion. I advised I wanted to deal directly w/ Citizens bank and the representative hung up on me. I called Back Citizens directly/XXXX spk w/ various managers advising I was not comfortable dealing w/ their 3rd party debt collector/suto law office and explained the immediate demand and the hang up. Citizen refused to help me and told me I need to deal w/ XXXX . I am ready to make payments to them immediately and bring my account current quickly ( I have advised them of this ). On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I called back Citizen bank again requesting to speak w/ a manager. I inquired about the 72-hour manager call back and they couldnt speak to that return call. I asked again for consideration on accepting my payments, but they again refused. I then requested a pay history since loan inception. They advised I needed to contact XXXX for the pay history online. I made the request with XXXX & have not received it. I am requesting Citizens bank reinstate my loan and I will catch up on pass due payments in the next 45days and ensure all future payments are made on time. I think Citizens being a very large institution can work w/ me here, especially since when I was advised of the action the XXXXhird party had only been engaged in the prior seven days and that over the course of the loan there were times I could have made payments after a missed ACH but was told by either Citizens or XXXX that I was not overdue and didnt need to make a payment. I have made this request but Citizens bank in refusing to help me,"

Checking or savings account,"We are still owed {$1700.00} which was taken back out of our account, since we did provide the proof and documentation in a timely manner to the Wells Fargo Claims department regarding our urgent matter involving the XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which was bad workmanship relating to the transmission we paid for which was still leaking and he defrauded us out of the Money as well. When we provided the valid proof to Wells Fargo they should have kept the temporary credit of {$1700.00} on our account and have gone after the the monies via Visa/XXXX  themselves versus causing a tremendous Financial Hardship on Consumers who are XXXX Minorities and U.S. Veterans who have served our Country. It was very unethical in the approach and discriminating tactic utilized by Wells Fargo in this case because they were well aware of the circumstance surrounding the claim when I initially reached out to them in XX/XX/XXXX. When I first spoke to a representative in on XX/XX/XXXX, they stated they did not need further other information regarding the claim after taking it over a call. We then later received a letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, stating Wells Fargo was going to reverse the temporary credit because they had not received the requested information regarding the claim. What requested information? You never stated during our call on XX/XX/XXXX that I needed to send in any additional information based on the dispute call submitted. Also, I checked my Wells Fargo portal to login to see if I had previously received any email alerts regarding requested information, since the first claim was submitted and confirmed I had not received any communication in my portal since XX/XX/XXXX regarding this matter. Therefore, the letter we received in the mail XX/XX/XXXX, was the 1st contact we received from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive an Voicemail from Wells Fargo since XX/XX/XXXX. Also, if they were really making an attempt to request additional information on XX/XX/XXXX, why did they not send an email on the secured Wells Fargo Portal where all the Disputes are filed and posted with updates. We also agreed to be notified via email at the onset of the claim being submitted as well. Also, when we initially received the first and only letter in the mail on XX/XX/XXXX, I immediately reached out to Wells Fargo to inform them I had not received any communication from them that stated or suggested they were attempting to contact me regarding Claim XXXX for {$1700.00} and only during this phone call was I provided what I needed to do at this point. On the following day, XX/XX/XXXX, an email and corresponding attachments which are included in this claim were sent to Wells Fargo including text messages exchanged between myself and the mechanic regarding the defaulted and fraudulent service provided to my vehicle regarding a supposedly fixed transmission which was not repaired. From this point, we did not receive any further communication until XX/XX/XXXX, stating they would be reversing the {$1700.00} credit, utilizing an excuse stating that you authorized the transaction. Regardless, if you authorized the transaction, it was still completed under false prentenses from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, as they did not repair the vehicle appropriately and we provided this proof of information and documentation to Wells Fargo on several occasions and the credit of {$1700.00} should have remained on our account versus causing an overbearing hardship and burden to XXXX XXXX American Consumers due to greed and lack of care exhibited by Wells Fargo to ensure their customer remained unharmed. They would rather have the consumer take the loss in the interim versus pursuing the monies after receiveing the required proof regarding this fraudulent transaction. Therefore, we are requesting that our {$1700.00} be refunded immediately and Wells Fargo retrieve the money via Visa/the Merchant based on provided proof and communications sent to Wells Fargo multiple times. We should not have to wait for Wells Fargo to retrieve the funds from the Merchant because you were provided with the documentation and proof that this was a fraudulent transaction due to bad /misrepresented services received. Also, we had prior debit commitments which are still due to hit our account and are requesting waiving/refunds for any overdraft charges, as a result of this valid consumer dispute regarding fraudulent charges and services were not provided as indicated in the customer/merchant agreement."
Checking or savings account,"I opened a checking and saving account with Citi bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I was trying to fund it with {$15000.00} to be eligible for a {$400.00} bonus as part of a promotion that was running at that time. However, I could not create an online account because I was not mailed a pin number that was required. I called Citi twice regarding this but never received my pin, and during the last call the representative suggested going to the branch to fund my account. Since I am working I could only go to the bank on the following weekend ( more than 30 days past opening ) and the employee at the bank funded my account and told me I would still be eligible for the bonus and he would put in a special note since it was not my fault I could not fund it sooner.

I waited 90 days but never received the bonus. I contacted Citi via a help line and when they were unable to help, I went to my local branch where I was promised I was still eligible for a bonus. They opened a case ( XXXX ) for me and on XX/XX/XXXX I got a letter from Citi stating "" We have confirmed that your account has met the necessary requirements to qualify for Promotion XXXX. Please allow 90 days from the date of the qualifying transaction ( s ), which satisfied the terms and conditions, to receive your incentive. '' 90 days from the date of qualifying transactions should mean 90 days from when I funded the account which was XX/XX/XXXX. But when I called Citi again, they told me it would take another 90 days!

So I waited another 90 days, for a total of over 6 months and have still not received my bonus. I have called citi again about not upholding what they stated in the letter, but rather than fixing the issue they opened another case ( # XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX and said it will be resolved and funded within 7-10 business days. So on XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to Citi via chat and they said they will contact their promotions department and I will hear back in 3 days.

Citi has continually failed to resolve this issue and keeps opening cases and routing to various departments with no end in sight. It has been over 180 days from when I met the qualifications for the bonus. I have an official letter from Citi stating that I would get the bonus within 90 days, so I feel this is clearly a breach of contract. Deal with Citi representatives on phone calls, going to the physical branches multiple times, keeping track of various messages/letters/cases has been extremely time consuming and a very frustrating experience. It is also financially difficult having to deal with this and maintain {$15000.00} with Citi for such a long time without access when I was expecting this only to last for 90 days. In short, Citi has failed to follow through what it has promised in their official communications and I feel lied and cheated to, with no avenue for resolution directly with Citi. I am therefore reaching out to CFPB to help resolve this and hopefully prevent other consumers from having to deal with these fraudulent and misleading tactics."
Debt collection,XXXX XXXX has been contacted on several occasions. They have failed to provide me with documentation bearing my signature so that I can validate that this account is indeed mine. They are reporting negative information and it is damaging my credit score. They have completely ignored all correspondence that I've sent. I am demanding for this account to be removed from my credit file immediately.
Checking or savings account,I have not received my {$50.00} promotion for opening my account with {$100.00}.
Credit card or prepaid card,"Dear Sir or Madam : I am writing to dispute a debit in the amount of {$1300.00} on my account. The amount is inaccurate because the merchandise I ordered was not delivered. I ordered the merchandise on XX/XX/19. I received the package on XX/XX/19, but opened the package on XX/XX/19. Upon opening the package, ( package came in a shipping bag instead of a box ) I noticed that the box of the product had already been opened and was not sealed in the plastic shrink-wrap that it would come with. When I opened the box, all of the contents were missing. Instead of what I ordered there was a heavy egg shaped granite sphere and what looks like a base that holds it. I immediately contacted the merchant through email as they are a XXXX company and I did not have a way to call. I explained to them that I received the package, but the contents were not what I ordered. The merchant explained to me they would contact their warehouse and email me once they received a response. On XX/XX/19 the merchant contacted me to explain that the warehouse informed them they had indeed shipped out the item. The issue at hand isn't if the warehouse shipped/did not ship the item. The issue is that the package that was shipped out was fraudulent, and did not have the items I ordered. The merchant explained to me there was nothing they could do and that I needed to contact my local shipping courier. Immediately after the merchant informed me of this, I inspected the shipping bag that the package came in. This shipping bag did not appear to have been tampered with, as the only cut was the one I had just made to open the package. Being a bag instead of a box would have made it difficult to hide any type of tampering. A bag would continue to show an opening no matter how it is taped as opposed to a box which can be opened and re-tapped without anyone 's knowledge. I proceeded to contact USPS and explained to them the situation. They let me know that this is something they would be looking into and would contact me by email. USPS sent back an email stating the package had been delivered without issue, and was delivered the same way they received it. I contacted the merchant and explained that USPS had completed their investigation and deemed that the package was delivered in the same condition it was sent. The seller then gave me the same reply to  check with the shipping company which sent the item to me. This is the point at which I contact my bank and file a dispute explaining what happened."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/19 I made what was deemed a purchase to an online company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX   XXXX with my XXXX XXXX XXXX Mastercard for XXXX. On the website it stated a XXXX fee was to be charged. 
As I do very month when my statement was posted online I paid my balance in full. I later saw that interest and a XXXX were being charged on my account as well. I called Barclay 's bank and was told that was due to my cash advance with XXXX XXXX. I told them I didn't authorize a cash advance, was never informed that this charge was one and hadn't done so in 35 years. 
I told Barclays I wished to dispute this charge, I was put on hold during which time I attempted to contact the merchant several times to no avail. A simple XXXX search listed numerous complaints of predatory practices against this company. 
When the customer rep returned they stated to contact the merchant and they wouldn't be disputing the charge and I should refer to the terms of my credit card user agreement. After speaking to several barclay reps I'm still getting charged interest thus far of XXXX, despite paying my balance off again in full again and paying extra on my card. When Ive called Barclay 's several times each customer rep also continues to gives me different information of how to pay off the unauthorized cash advance balance."
Debt collection,"About 2 1/2 years ago I purchased a truck from XXXX 's XXXX XXXX located on XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, N.Y. The price was {$14000.00} I gave them {$3000.00} down and financed the balance through Credit Acceptance, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Mi. XXXX. I was told by XXXX 's XXXX XXXX  that in order for me to get financed I had to put an extended warranty on the vehicle, I explained that the vehicle would be used at times for commercial purposes. They told me "" don't put any lettering on the vehicle. '' I canceled the extended warranty because it did not cover the truck if it was used for commercial purposes. I was told that the cost and finance charges for the warranty would come off the back end of the loan. After further reading the paperwork I realized XXXX 's XXXX XXXX had arbitrarily raised the price to {$17000.00} without telling me and after I paid them the down payment of {$3000.00}. When I confronted them I was told that Credit Acceptance told them to raise the price, all this without ever telling me they were raising the price. So I called Credit Acceptance and complained about the bait and switch, they denied ever telling XXXX 's XXXX XXXX to do that. I told them I wanted this corrected and was told their legal dept would contact me. The Legal Dept never contacted me but when I got behind in my payment Credit Acceptance had the truck repossessed without warning and by that I mean I had to agree to let XXXX 's XXXX XXXX put a device on the truck that would beep 3 times as a warning that a payment was due. The contract stated that this warning would be every time I started the truck for three days and if payment was not received then the device would not let me start the truck. I did not receive any warning as per the agreement in the contract. After the truck was repossessed I was never given any information about what it sold for at auction, as required by law, or that the {$3000.00} added to the truck by XXXX 's XXXX XXXX or the credit for the canceled extended warranty was ever credited to me. When I called Credit Acceptance about all of this complaint I was told just give us {$5000.00} and we will call it even. I want this removed from my credit report and shown as paid."
Checking or savings account,"We recently had a credit of {$1700.00} in XXXX which was reposted back to our our account after it was previously deducted back out of our account due to a 3rd party vendor fraudulent charge on our account which caused us {$340.00} in fees since XX/XX/XXXX and was told that overdraft fees would be reversed back into our account, once the credit or {$1700.00} reposted back to our account. Had those monies been in our account we would not have incurred the fees and we are requesting a refund of {$340.00} in fees which were charged to our account during the period of time the {$1700.00} it was deducted and also reported the issue to Customer Service over the phone and via their Customer Service Portal and was informed in their email message that they could not help or did not have insight to our claim. 

This is not true. Wells Fargo Claims and Customer Service Reps did not make a concerted effort to help us resolve this matter and are reaching out to CFPB to help us with this matter. Also, we experienced some retailiation from the Wells Fargo Claims or Banking Department since we filed a couple of compliants with CFPB regarding the {$1700.00} which was previously taken back out of our account, although they were provided with proper documentation. We have since experienced retaliation in being able to utilize the overdraft protection program which we have affiliated with this card. Also, they rejected a Utilities Bill payment which came through for {$50.00} and believe this was done intentionally as a result of us previously reporting Wells Fargo on several occasions regarding the {$1700.00} debit matter. Also, they have restricted the card with being able to get cash back which was also previously part of the Overdraft Protection plan as well. We are now being punished and retailiated against because reported them and can not fully utilize the Premium benefits associated with my Checking account. This is very ruthless and discriminatory behavior as well."

Student loan,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from Navient for my XX/XX/XXXX monthly payment. Upon reading the notice, I saw that I had now been places in full repayment of my loan instead of paying the interest monthly. Prior to this notice, I paid $ XXXX monthly in interest. The new payment amounted to {$220.00}, which I was not comfortable with given my other monthly obligations. I called Navient and inquired about an the Extended Repayment option and their Rate Reduction +Extended Repayment option I saw on their website. I was told on the regular Navient call by the CSR that I would have to speak to their Credit Collections Department about these repayment options. I was somewhat confused by this information and asked the CSR if seeking either of these repayment options would impact my credit negatively. The CSR assured me that my credit would not be negatively impacted and that the Credit Collections Department just happens to be the department that handles those particular repayment options. I was forward over to the Credit Collections Department and a CSR began to assist. I explained my situation of being unable to pay the {$220.00} and she asked what payment I would be comfortable making. I told her {$100.00}. She asked me to hold and when she came back on the line she said {$120.00} was the best offer. I accepted this offer and she gave me information about the length of this reduced payment option as XXXX of XXXX. She also asked for my debit card info to have me signed up for automatic payments. I asked if I would have my information updated on Navients website and if I would receive any mailed information or documentation on the payment agreement that I had just arranged. She informed me that her department was different from Navient and that I can only call in to get information about my new arrangement. She also informed that something will me sent in the mail regarding my new payment. I was not told if my credit would be impacted and I was given no information about whether or not my previous regular payment arrangement would honor my new arrangement. I still had questions but I was at work and had to end the call. However, I decided to call after work because I still felt uneasy about my new arrangement. I also felt uneasy because upon checking my account during lunch break I didnt see any update on Navients website to my {$220.00} payment. I decided to call after work and around XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I called and I asked the CSR if my credit would be impacted by me setting up this payment arrangement with Collections. The CSR explained to me that the payment arrangement set up with the Collections Department had nothing to do with the {$220.00} and that I would still be responsible for the {$100.00} balance outside of the new payment arrangement with them. She also informed that I would be late and delinquent if I did not pay the full amount. At this point I became upset and sarcastically retorted that if I had to still pay {$220.00}, I had no need to put myself through long holds and speaking with countless CSRs to have me at the same {$220.00}. The CSR sensed my frustration and placed me on a hold to find out more information. Upon returning to the call, she informed that the Collections Department had already closed for the day and I should call back tomorrow so the discrepancy could be resolved. I informed her that tomorrow I would have to restart the entire conversation with different individuals and probably have the same result. Although she attempted to be helpful, I got the impression that she wanted me off the phone so that I could be someone elses problem tomorrow."

Mortgage,"This is for Maryland. 

My wife and I originally purchased our home in XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX we did a refinance with Bank of America. We signed a Deed of Trust in XX/XX/XXXX and the Lien was recorded with the county in XX/XX/XXXX. However, BoA messed something up with the paperwork and we had to re-sign an updated Deed of Trust in XX/XX/XXXX which was for {$770.00} less than the XX/XX/XXXX paperwork and was just reflecting the updated amount of the loan and was NOT a new lien. That Deed of Trust was recorded by the county in XX/XX/XXXX. The loan was then sold to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and we continued to make all payments until XX/XX/XXXXwhen we re-financed again. We got a Lien Release from XXXX in the mail as expected and didnt have any concerns. 


Now, we have a sales contract on the house and in the course of the Title Search, the lien from XX/XX/XXXX is coming up as unreleased. I didnt think it would be a problem since I have all the paperwork and so I contacted Bank of America and sent a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust and explained that the XX/XX/XXXX lien was still open and it needed to be closed since it was in error. 
Since then I feel like I have gotten nothing but a run-around and conflicting information every time I call. I even went into my local BoA branch last week and had the branch manager help me escalate with the Lien Release department and now when I called today for an update Im getting completely new and different information than what I was told on Friday with a BoA person on the phone with me. BoA is claiming they have no record of the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust and therefore cant help me and I should contact XXXX  ( now know as XXXX XXXX ). So I called Nationstar and they confirm that they only received paperwork on a Deed of Trust dated XX/XX/XXXX and that they properly released it when we paid off the loan in XX/XX/XXXX. So I contacted BoA again and they continue to claim that no Deed exists and if it did exist then it would have been sent to XXXX. 


Its clear to everyone looking at the Deeds of Trust that they were for basically the same amount and the paperwork even has the exact same loan number of it but I cant get anyone who does the Lien Releases to acknowledge that. I was supposed to close on XX/XX/XXXX and that had to be delayed because the title insurance wont sign off with the encumbrance. 

No one seems willing to help and issue the lien release. 

I have attached a title search showing the Deed recorded on XX/XX/XXXX being still open/unreleased and also attaching a copy of the XX/XX/XXXX Deed of Trust that was notarized and submitted to XXXX County Maryland and shows a recorded date of XX/XX/XXXX"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/19, received call from Quicken Loans "" XXXX  XXXX-NMLS # XXXX '' ( the call was recorded ) stating they've tried to reach me to help reduce my mortgage. After a bit of small talk, she said she'd see if she can help me, but would need to run my credit report. I explicitly told her 'I do not want anything run that will affect my credit ; I am VERY protective of it. '' She told me that it would not affect my score/report, and she's never gotten any feedback that a score would be affected. Warily, I agreed. She went on to 'review ' the report, telling me everything I already knew. I explained to her there's nothing Quicken Loans can do for me and we hung up. 

Within 10 minutes, I received emails stating that my report had been run and the score dropped FROM 771 TO 716!!!! I am furious! I called her manager and emailed her. She apologized. Her manager called me and for 10-15 minutes tried to get me to agree to a loan to consolidate my existing bills. I had to hang up ; to return to work. 

I suspect many people fall prey to their tactics, and I am very disappointed in Quicken Loans. 

Here 's the facts : - No one has ever tried to reach me from Quicken Loans. That's the guise they use. 
- I DID NOT agree to have credit run that would negatively affect my credit score. 
- Now, there's a hard inquiry on my report for a mortgage loan -- I don't need a loan, I plan to pay off my loan in a few years anyway. 

Please post something to people are aware of scrupulous tactics like this. I know better and was literally lied to by Quicken Loans.

Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I had scheduled mortgage payments using the ACH system. Wells Fargo ACH system did not pick up the payments until several days after I had scheduled the payments, which caused my bank account to be overdrawn due to Wells Fargo 's delayed process for ACH payments. I have attempted to propose and execute a payment plan which includes paying all further mortgage payments via Treasurer 's check from XXXX XXXX, my bank. I was in the process of executing the payment plan I had proposed when Wells Fargo had papers delivered compelling me to accept their mortgage modifications or face foreclosure. I have faxed their application and the proofs required to them. While I have a decent credit score, I have frozen my credit reports on all credit bureaus, so I would prefer not to allow any one time access of my credit report, considering I have the necessary income to make the payments according to the plan I have proposed. I intend to sue Wells Fargo if they do not properly accept the payment plan I proposed, considering it's not likely it would be an undue hardship for Wells Fargo to accept the payment plan."
Student loan,"On XX/XX/19 I received a call from an individual whose son I was in a relationship with stating that XXXX XXXX from Navient contacted her stating that I put her down as a reference and he was trying to reach me. The individual was upset be the call as she is not a blood relative of mine and does not have contact with me regularly. She tried to track me down. Once she reached me she provided me the name of XXXX XXXX and stated that he gave her a call back number of XXXX. I tried contacting this number at the line just goes busy and sometimes it says the number is not in service. The individual stated that the number on her caller I.D . is XXXX. I contacted that number as well and the same thing occurred. I "" XXXX '' the number and it said that it was reported as a Scam. I also believe this to be a scam as I suspect that a known company like Navient would not result to seedy collection practice such as calling random individuals and lying to them about the contents of my loan documents. To my knowledge my loan is in forbearance. This individual was very upset. XXXX XXXX lied to the individual and stated that I put her down as a reference when I in fact had not even dated her son until after law school and didn't even know her is then. She just had a XXXX XXXX and spent weeks in the hospital. She was stressed, alarmed and very upset by XXXX XXXX 's call. Lying and being deceptive in debt collection is is illegal and what about my rights to privacy. The fact that he identified himself as being from Navient, although I suspect that he was not and was just some kind of a scammer, violates my rights. This lady may not be my mother but she is someone's mother. If her pressure had dropped or spiked and she went into another XXXX XXXX just because she answered her own phone and was lied to by a scammer. What would the recourse be? She is learning to just to read, write and feed herself now. She can't even drive anymore and it should not be okay for a debt collect or "" scammer '' as I believe to put her through this.

Student loan,"For the past several months I have had an ongoing issue with Sallie Mae. I dont have specific dates because it is every single month there is a problem with Sallie Mae. First they turned off my auto debit for my payment, I called and was told auto debit was not an option even though I had it for over a year. Called back again and someone said it was an option and wasnt sure why I was told that. Auto debit was turned back on, then Sallie Mae continued to pull my payment from the incorrect bank account after I had called twice to update it, they charged me late fees for an error that they made. Now every month I have to call to set up a payment and sometimes I am told auto debit is on and sometimes I am told I have no auto debit on my account. All payments are up to date, and since XX/XX/2020 I have been fighting with them because they are saying my account is past due when I literally spoke with someone and have emails showing the payment being processed. Every time I call a customer service representative with what seems like has half a brain tells me something different about my account. One told me I owed {$400.00}, another told me {$900.00}, another told me {$700.00} and another told me {$1600.00}. When I asked why that was the balance owed when I made all payments her response was well I didnt really look into it so you mean to tell me youre a rep for a student loan company and you tell someone information about a payment and you dont really look into it? They told me to submit my bank statements showing proof of payment, I did, then they call back a few days later saying they cant find the bank statements I submitted. And then tell me a new balance is owed. How is there a new balance owed every time? And how is there a payment due when Ive made the payments? They offer no solutions, they offer no alternatives, they have no knowledge of anything they are talking about. Every single person I speak to has something different to say about my account but not a single person can offer a helpful solution. This is the absolute worst company I have ever dealt with and I have no idea how they are even operating. The most unprofessional, unknowledgeable company in student loans. They lose my payments, then put them past due, then state my account is current, then say theres late fees. I dont trust this company with any money I have to give them."

I went online to pay my bill and it showed my balance of over {$6000.00} with deferred interest added before the end of the promotional on XX/XX/XXXX of {$3400.00}. I have until XXXX to make such payments. If I am late, there is no grace period before I am charged {$38.00} for late fees. In addition, once payments are made, the account is not updated right away. Therefore, it is hard to determine if the payments are made until one checks one account. While this maybe a good thing for customers who do not have money at the time that one needs to get the XXXX work or XXXX done, it is a moose around the customers neck and the customer service representative are not very nice people."

I already disputed this with the credit bureaus and they verified it as being accurate. I am not sure how this happened, I |thought that I had made my payments to you on time when I received my statements. My only thought is that my monthly statement did not get to me or maybe an error occurred where it wasn't recorded on time. 

I do ask in light of the good standing relationship we have that you remove any late payments from my credit report and refund me any late fees that were added to my account. I do not believe it is accurate. 

I would rather not have to spend more time than necessary for both of us to resolve this situation so I was hoping that instead of escalating anything, that you could help me with this and report me as being 100 % on time.

It also governs creditors, collection agencies and other businesses that furnish information ( furnishers ) to the CRAs. The FCRA provides victims of identity theft with numerous rights. Consumers can bring legal claims against the CRAs and furnishers if they fail to comply with the FCRA. 
The most important right is the blocking of information on a credit report that resulted from identity theft. A CRA must block the reporting of any fraudulent information within four business days of receiving a dispute from a consumer that contains : Identification of the fraudulent information ; A copy of an identity theft report ( an identity theft report is an official, valid report filed by the consumer with a federal, state or local law enforcement agency including the post office ) ; A statement by the consumer that the information is not related to any transaction by the consumer ; and Appropriate proof of identity. 
The CRA must notify the furnisher of the information that it has blocked the information as fraudulent. The CRA will also notify the two other national CRAs that it has blocked the information. The consumer should receive a letter from the CRA stating that the information has been blocked. 
If the consumer sends the CRA the required materials and the CRA does not block the disputed information within four days, the consumer can bring a legal claim against the CRA."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I'm having an issue with CitiCards. When I make a payment for my statement balance in full, the last two times they have always requested/received TWO full statement balance payments from my bank. So,  I've had the same issue happen twice now. 
It happened once on XX/XX/XXXX. 
It just happened again today/yesterday. The payment is still processing/pending with my bank. 

So, inXX/XX/XXXX, I scheduled a payment for {$900.00}. It was scheduled at some point in advance of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, my checking account with XXXX XXXX XXXX that was being used to pay the credit card bill is charged for {$900.00} TWICE. My credit card bill then starts to show a balance of NEGATIVE {$900.00}. I didn't think much of it at the time because I thought I may have scheduled two payments on the same day by accident and not checked the scheduled payments. I carried a negative balance on the card for a while and had no need to make a payment in XX/XX/XXXX. When the billing cycle payment due date came around in XX/XX/XXXX, I had a bill for {$91.00}. I used the mobile app to schedule payment XX/XX/XXXX. I checked it to confirm there was only ONE  listed scheduled payment. That was all I ever saw. I received an email from Citi cards telling me that my payment was received and then I saw something showing I had a NEGATIVE balance again. 

I contacted CitiCards today through their chat platform. The person was helpful, but I have no sense of this actually being resolved. I contacted my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, to confirm it wasn't on their end. They said they received two  authorizations in XX/XX/XXXX and there are two more coming in for this recent instance. XXXX XXXX XXXX offered to put in fraud claims for any/all of the charges, but I elected to not pursue that at this time because I don't want "" block '' myself from paying my own credit card bill. I was concerned that would lead to late fees or interest fees with Citi that I would have to discuss with them. 

I requested that I receive an email or phone call of some kind to verify that this is taken care of. It seemed as though they will apply this information to my account, but I have no idea if anything will change. I just wanted to get this out there because if people are carrying a relatively low checking account balance, this DOUBLE billing practice may result in fees from their bank or wherever they are drawing from to pay their credit card."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I froze my credit file with all three major credit reporting agencies back in 2006. I had some practical issues unfreezing the credit reports last year. This year I contacted all three credit reporting agencies via U.S. Mail ( see attachment ), asking them to check that the information they had on file was up to date. I also asked them, very clearly, to keep the freeze on my credit file. I also asked them for clear updated instructions on how to unfreeze my credit file, if that need were to arise sometime soon. These actions on my part are good standard practices to prevent fraud and identity theft. 

XXXX and XXXX responded adequately they got it right. Experian did not only get it wrong, they got it BACKWARDS! Think of backwards as being super-duper wrong. Extremely nonsensically wrong. So wrong that a thinking person would curl up in a corner and die of embarrassment for being stupid. Experian permanently removed the security freeze on my credit file!!! Now instead of having my credit file safely frozen, they've opened it up for the whole world. This is exactly the opposite of what I wanted to be done. I'm not going to charge them any money, at this time, for pointing out a terrible flaw in their business system of correspondence via U.S. Mail. 

Additionally, they allowed an incorrect XXXX XXXX XXXX to be available on the Internet. Having the wrong XXXX XXXX # caused a 2-3 week delay in communicating with them via U.S. Mail. It was very difficult to find someone to talk to at Experian to finally get the correct XXXX XXXX  #. 

Experian should not be allowed to hide behind some defense of incompetence or error. Let 's be honest, Experian loses money on credit freezes and will do almost anything to discourage and confuse consumers into properly using credit freezing/unfreezing options."
Debt collection,"I XXXX XXXX realizes that the debt collection process is complicated. In 2017 the U.S. Supreme Court decided in Henson v. Santander Consumer Financial USA, whereas third-party ownership voids my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Several of my old charges were never transferred to new ownership with written verification or validation, just a one page letter claiming that the original debt was sold. I am willing to settle on my old accounts that are still legitimately within the 6-year charge off timeline to enforce collections. However, I request a copy of the actual transfer rights of ownership. This is mandatory in any state or federal court jurisdiction where applicable. I also request the actual purchase price on transfer, which is only fair on any negotiated settlement. Accordingly, I request full disclosure from all debt ownerships, and if possible a reasonable settlement offer on the basis from the charged off date. I am entertaining a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy petition in the meantime, and will pull that trigger if there is no other alternative."
Credit card or prepaid card,I bought a Netspend Pre-Paid VISA card purchase price for the card was XXXX + Tax I put the amount of money on the card. There was no choice at this time that there were different plans to choose from that gave them the ability to take fees out of the money put on the card. The card they give you is temporary and for ten to fourteen days you have no idea that they can charge fees and what those fees are for. I bought my card thinking that the amount I paid to put the money on the card was the only fee that I would be charged so like an XXXX I never bothered to check but after the third purchase I made with the card I was wondering if something was wrong and I find out Im being charged XXXX for a monthly fee that I was never made aware of and it is do to the way Netspend does business. They purposely use a temporary card and give no information about how the card can take your money and by the time you receive your permanent card you have already started using it and a person tends not to have these questions at that time because when they used the card they had already committed to whatever the rules of the card was only to find out later that they have been hit with fees they never got the chance to deny it they felt they were unacceptable. By then the Netspend Company already got your money when you times this by thousands and tens of thousands Netspend making Great Amount of Money by ripping their customers off. So this is my complaint I dont think Netspend VISA should be aloud to continue ripping people off and I was wondering if you could stop them for us. Thank You.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, I received a credit alert from three different monitoring agencies that I have subscribed, stating that my TransUnion credit score dropped 20 points. This despite drop occurred dispite fact that there has been no change nor has any derogatory information been placed on my file. Upon calling TransUnion, the customer service representative had no explanation to the drop in score. 

For the better part of the last year, I have been diligently working to remove erroneous and fraudulent matters that were attached to my credit file.

None of these disputed and removed matters would have initially been placed on my credit file if your agency had done a modicum of investigation confirming the accuracy of the debt.

Because of TransUnions financial relationship with such institutions as XXXX XXXX and other credit lenders, there is an intentional effort to keep those trying to rebuild a credit rating from achieving that goal by sporadically and systematically manipulating the credit score downward, forcing the consumer into a high fee/high interest rate credit card situation.

Checking or savings account,"I checked my bank account and had an available balance of {$94.00} at approximately XXXX EST on XX/XX/2019. Upon checking my account this morning my account was over drafted with three insufficient fund fees being assessed. When I called to ask how was I assessed these fees on pending transactions, and why the order of the pending transactions continued to change daily, no one could provide an honest answer. I first spoke with XXXX located in a call center in the XXXX, she stated that the transactions that came through were delayed because of the past XXXX XXXX holiday. However, these transactions were made earlier in the previous week. Yet, a check that was just presented potentially on a non-business day, Sunday, or, on the following business day due to the holiday, which would be Tuesday, XX/XX/2019 had cleared within a day. Which has never happened. The checks that I have written in the past to the said entity of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as other checks presented have always taken a minimum 2-3 business days. Yet, this {$160.00} was taken and applied first after several transactions dating back to the previous week. 

I then asked to speak with a supervisor. I was transferred again to a XXXX call center and spoke with XXXX XXXX. She by her own admission stated that they have an ordering system for transactions and they can and will post items even at XXXX based on their own criteria. Again, I said that if Im being assessed fees for pending items, that I am not being allowed the opportunity to make a deposit or transfer funds into the account before XXXX of that business day which is marketed as a overdraft and debit protection. 
I called back a third time and spoke with XXXX in a XXXX based call center. She advised me that the bank has no control over when merchants submit ACH automatic debits and for credit purchases, the merchants have 180 days to do so. Again, this is not logical because for all debit purchases require the cardholder to enter their pin, which should equate to the funds being debited IMMEDIATELY. She by her own admission stated that the order sequence is from HIGHEST to SMALLEST transaction. I told her that these were all debit transactions that have been reordered and some were extremely aged from the previous week. I then asked to be transferred to a supervisor in a US based call center. At this time, I was transferred to XXXX. She advised that theyre ordering system starts with the HIGHEST amount transaction per category then to lowest and they can assess 3 insufficient fees per day. This proves that not only does Chase change the ordering system, it is likely they utilize a software program to do so. This is very deceptive in nature. And it greatly benefits Chase to be able to profit substantially in the amount of {$100.00} per account holder per day. This has and remains to be an ongoing issue with this institution in which several class action lawsuits have been brought against for such deceptive and unethical business and banking practices. Chase has simply attempted to find a method that appears to be legal and undetectable to gain profit. Even if doing so on pending transactions which is not only unethical but seemingly illegal. 
Chase continues to misrepresent their debit protection, overdraft protection, processing times, and processing order. Their processing order overdrafts the account on items that would have more than enough available funds to cover. However, Chase continues to change the order on days old transactions for the potential to have consumer overspend and be manipulated in what their balance truly is. And they have adopted such practices and implemented training to their employees domestically and internationally to deceive the unwitting and otherwise inattentive account holder. 
Since filing my first complaint, this predatory practice has occurred again on twp separate occasions resulting in an additional 8 fees amounting to {$270.00} on the account. 3 being assessed in the early morning hours after XXXX EST.

This again has happened ad of XX/XX/2019 accounting in two additional fees. Chase has not returned ALL of the fees they have erroneously charged my account through means of deceptive business practices and unethical, yet extremely profitable means. 

My debit card was deactivated due to potential fraud. Upon me attempting to make a deposit into my checking account via the ATM, I was advised that my card was inactive and I was unable to use it at the ATM. At that time, I called customer service and explained this to them. I also asked if this card could be reactivated for the sole purpose of making the deposit. XXXX advised me that this was no possible. I then asked if IF there were ANY transactions coming through the account. She advised me no. I then proceeded to explain to her that I had wanted to make sure because I couldn't make a deposit until the following business day. I specifically asked about checks, and she advised me no. She asked for the amount of the check. She advised she did not see any. I checked my online account at XXXX EST and the account was showing a positive balance. HOWEVER, one again, the check was processed in the late hours of the night, not allowing me the time to make a deposit before the standard XXXX that the customer is deceptively promised. Again, the order sequence was switched to bring the larger transaction through, causing 2 fees. I called customer service and was again transferred to the XXXX. I spoke with XXXX who informed me the information given by XXXX was not correct. I then asked to speak with a supervisor. After being on hold for nearly 15 minutes, I was then transferred to a "" XXXX XXXX '' that attempted to reverse the fees and could not. I then went to the branch to make a deposit. 

On 2 previous complaints, I have specifically requested that am independent review be performed on my account to address how many predatory fees I have been charged. Each time, I would only see credits of the fees being reversed to my account. Yet, they have assessed 5 fees that remain to be refunded. I received a response and two voicemails from XXXX XXXX at the Executive Office in  Ohio. Her response DID NOT address any of my concerns. IT merely danced around the issue stating "" we've refunded your account '' to provide a "" better experience ''. It is unknown why a simple audit by their accounting unit can not be performed as requested. Especially in lieu of past illegal practices adopted and performed by JPMorgan Chase that would result in several class action lawsuits. 

I would like to know WHY this audit information has not been provided timely.two complaints asking for this information, I am left with no other choice than to assue and believe that JPMorgan Chase is not only refusing to provide me with the documentation of an audit to address the concerns that I have ; and they are doing so with intentions to not address and hide the fact that they are in fact continuing to engage in illegal practices to prey on the account holders for the sole purpose of profit. 

After making two separate complaints to numerous financial agencies, I would like to know have these very serious concerns gone unaddressed despite 2 representatives at the executive level and three complaint submission. I would again like this all in writing for my personal review as well as legal review. I demand this audit immediately within 15 business days. And that the 5 fees that have not been refunded be done so immediately AS WELL AS ANY OTHER FEES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSESSED TO MY ACCOUNT AS A RESULT OF THIS DECEPTIVE, PREDATORY, AND ILLEGAL BANKING PRACTICE."
Student loan,"I applied for the XXXX XXXX Loan Forgiveness program and I was granted {$10000.00} in forgiveness which cleared all of my remaining debt with Navient. I received several emails congratulating me on paying off my loan and the balance went to {$0.00}. I even talked to a rep who canceled my monthly auto payments and confirmed that I was all set and that I should receive a letter in the mail confirming this. After several months I received nothing but I did get a notification that I was due to resume payments soon. I had no idea what this was referring to so I called Navint and a rep informed me that they misfiled my paperwork. I should have received only {$5000.00} in forgiveness, not {$10000.00}. She informed me that I was in fact due to resume paying off my loan. Sadly, in the months that had passed since I was informed by Navient that I had paid the loan in full, I had transferred any remaining money I had to pay off the loan into my Roth IRA. I thought I was making a wise financial choice only to find out that I once again needed that money so that I could pay off the mistaken amount."
Checking or savings account,On XX/XX/XXXX I was trying to make a withdrawal from both my checki my accounts ... I thought it was the machine but when both accounts were declined I called Chase Morgan bank right away. They informed me that they have decided to end the relationship with me aka closing the account. I received no letters let alone any reason as to why they decided to move forward on closing my account. I informed them that the next day I was to receive a direct deposit of about XXXX bucks from my work which that never went through however my work payroll informed me that it already went through and is unable to write me another check and that I need to contact my bank So now my bank refuses to answer me or give me.my money!

I have no idea because I have never received anything with Savings Account Number.

2 ) "" Said account '' that I was accessed an OVER-DRAW FEE for was never consummated in any way shape or form. 
3 ) Citi claims they sent a "" welcome packet '' as well as "" banking information '' letter. XXXX again. Nothing ever arrived. 
4 ) Citi stole my information on the online form. No nothing after I input data. 
5 ) My credit rating takes hit because of OVER-DRAW. Great, I work to obtain well over 800 credit rating ... ... for what??? Or, for who ... ..certainly not the consumer. You know, I have never been offered a better loan fee than what was listed for everyone ... ... funny how that works. Again, who is my credit rating for? 
7 ) Check out CITII BANK "" chat window '' that never works '' ...!!!!! 
8 ) MY BAD, the APR was way to good ... .if it sounds too good to be true ... .CITI will XXXX you!

Money transfers,"To whom it concerns, I would like to file a formal complaint against Citi Prepaid Services, regarding an outbound manual money transfer made on XX/XX/2016. 

The transfer was never delivered to my partners XXXX account with XXXX, and also was n't delivered to the intermediary bank, XXXX XXXX. 

We have been told by Citi Prepaid that the transfer left our account and should have been received on XX/XX/2016. Over a month ago Citi Prepaid informed us it was being elevated to their own personal investigations department and that we would hear from them regarding the status of our investigation. 

During this time frame we have heard nothing aside from that it is being investigated. We have been given zero updates with no regard for any questions we have risen concerning the status of this ongoing investigation. 

This is highly concerning as now we are worried that the money is lost or stolen and we have no support from Citi Prepaid Services in tracking the missing transfer. Their costumer services supervisor, XXXX, Informed us they can not give us a tracking number or any information, which seems unbelievable and suspicious. 

The effects of this situation go beyond just our missing money. My partner and I are damaging our credit ratings by the day, and due to a total lack of confidence in Citi Prepaid 's transfer system we are afraid to move more money into our personal accounts. 

I request that you respond to this compliant urgently. 

Yours Sincerely,"

At first i was like in shock because i never had so much money but i had no knowledge about wire transfers and money scams so i was definetly a easy target. i had to transfer funds from my bank account to XXXX XXXX and what not but i aint smell a bit of scam because the doctor actually provided proof that it was all for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called the bank to check the wire again and see if its legit, i reserached everything, the doctors name, phone number, scam websites, searched his email and everything and i did not find one thing so it all seemed legit. i asked the doctor a million questions about himself and he answered them. But i couldn't just keep this wrong feeling in my heart even though everyhting seemed real and legal, thats why im reaching out to you guys because im a miltary XXXX and i cant have a messed up credit, or be in debt or any problems. i quit the job respectfully because i felt something was wrong."

When I paid this loan off in XXXX, I still had a balance of {$7000.00}. I would still be paying for this loan if it were not for obtaining some financial help. It's just sad how long I paid for a loan that the school ended up closing because it was basically a scam school. So not only do I have an Accounting Certificate from XXXX XXXX XXXX that means nothing but I also wasted a lot of money in interest and principle paying for an invalid school. I did not know better when I signed up for this school. It's too late to take back what happened. I'm a person that pays their bills so I was never late on a payment. It's good that the school can not do this any longer, but I could finally have a sense of relief when that loan was paid in full."

BOTTOM LINE : C1 changed its online User Interface and log on procedures without warning ; I have been prevented, now for 2 weeks, from logging on to my account and paying my bill of XX/XX/19. I clearly can not get any resolution from Capital One. Please advise."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I have an account with the money transfer service Transferwise. 

On XX/XX/2019, I received an e-mail about a money transfer being sent to a recipient in the XXXX, which I did not recognize nor authorize, in the amount of XXXX US Dollars. 

I contacted Transferwise and they informed me the money had already been sent and wasn't recoverable.

I strongly believe my Transferwise account was hacked into and this person used saved payment data to make a transfer to themselves ( or a fake alias ).

Once I logged onto my bank accounts and cards and noticed no money was taken out of my accounts, I immediately contacted Transferwise again to inquire how could the transfer be completed and the money sent, and no transaction be showing in either of my bank accounts. They informed me, then, that the payment method used was a Debit Card from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not have nor did ever have business with that bank institution. 

After realizing the money that funded my transaction had not come from my personal accounts, Transferwise said the matter was resolved. 

However, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire if any accounts had been opened using my personal data and they were unable to find any accounts under my name ( and all possible variations ), nor my Social Security Number. 

My best guess is some fraudster ( details below obtained from the Transferwise Transaction receipt ) used my account and someone else 's payment info to make this XXXX US Dollars transfer. 

I did inform XXXX XXXX of that, and did forward a copy of the transaction receipt to their representative XXXX XXXX, who was very helpful in trying to find if any accounts had been opened under my name or SSN. 

This is all the information I was able to retrieve from the recipient to which the money transfer was sent. I managed to obtain the following details in the Transfer Receipt : Recipient Details Recipient : XXXX XXXX Order Number : XXXX Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX., XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX Phone : XXXX XXXX XXXX Bank Account Details Sort Code : XXXX IBAN : XXXX IBAN BIC : XXXX Account Number : XXXX I have also submitted a report with the National Fraud & Cyber Crime Reporting Center in the XXXX XXXX, home of the Recipient of the transfer."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I arrived in the branch to open a business credit card account. I initiated the process online for a Wells Fargo Business Platinum Credit Card with a "" New customer offer : Get a one-time {$500.00} cash back bonus or XXXX bonus points when you enroll in the Business Card Rewards Program and spend {$3000.00} in the first three months of account open date ; {$0.00} annual rewards fee ''. This was shared with the banker to assist. The card application was approved and mailed around XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I have had several inquiries to Wells Fargo regarding the payout of this offer. Including XXXX XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I even went to the bank where the branch manager assisted calling cardmember services to investigate and resolve the error in payment. The latest communication I have received is "" Our records do not reflect a promotional bonus offer for this account. "" I am quite upset that I fulfilled my obligation and Wells Fargo has not yet lived up to their promise for the promotional terms."

THEY TOLD ME THAT MY ACCOUNT WAS RESTRICTED AND WILL BE CLOSED IN 10 DAYS BECAUSE OF TRANSACTIONS THAT HAPPENED ON MY ACCOUNT THE PERSON DEPOSITED CHECKS FROM THE ATM AND WITHDREW MONEY THEY SAID USING MY PIN NUMBER.

I HAVE NEVER DEPOSITED ANY CHECKS INTO MY ACCOUNT OR EVER WENT TO ANY WINDOW TO WITHDRAW ANYTHING FROM MY ACCOUNT. THE ACCOUNT WAS OPENED SO I CAN RECEIVE MY SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. MY MOM CALLED ON XX/XX/2019 TO DISPUTE WHAT HAPPENED AND TO HELP ME PUT A CLAIM ON MY ACCOUNT. THEY PUT THE CLAIM ON THE ACCOUNT FOR THE ATM WITHDRAWALS. THEY DID NOT PUT A CLAIM FOR WHAT WAS SITHDRAWN AT THE WINDOW. I NEVER HEARD ANY RESULTS FROM THE CLAIM. MY SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK WAS DEPOSITED IN THE CHASE ACCOUNT ON XX/XX/2019. THEY KEPT THE SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK AND SENT A BILL DUE OF {$13.00} AND SAID THE ACCOUNT WAS CLOSED AND CHASE WILL NO LONGER DO BUSINESS WITH ME. MY DAD TOOK ME IN THE BANK AND PAID THE {$13.00} AND WE STILL HAVE NOT HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE RESULTS FOR ANY INVESTIGATION.

They now claim that it is too late to dispute. This comedy of errors is their fault due to misinformation, poor process control, and flat out false and misleading information by their people.

They have not sent me any written documentation and refuse to tell me what they debt is or who they are calling on behalf of. They are threatening me and family members.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","To make a long story short, there was activity with my bank account and through another credit bureau ( not equifax ) that i didn't recognize so i placed a fraud aleart/credit freeze on my credit through another credit agency. Heres the problem, i originally pulled all 3 of my reports but i never received one from equifax, i tried calling into equifax to ask why i never received a credit report but nobody wanted to help me, like AT ALL!! The only thing they kept instantly repeating is you need to send in photocopy 's of personal documents like drivers license, ssn card etc. I talked in over with a friend and they said they probably just dont have your information on file. I received a letter from equifax in XXXX saying "" as you requested we successfully placed a fraud alert on equifax credit report. This alert will remain on your equifax credit report for one year ''. The letter then goes into how the frraud alert will be passed onto XXXX  and XXXX  and lists some contact information for equifax. Your probably already beginning to see the problems. Do i have a credit report with equifax or not? Id like an answer to that. If i do have a credit report then why did i have to goe through all of the personal document XXXX on the phone? please keep in mind, that doesnt go over well since someone probably stole my identity and someone from from equifax is asking ( more like demanding, Your welcome to listen to the recorded phone calls, i swear im not lieing! ) for photocopys of my personal documents for apparently no reason at all. I wonder how my lawyer would look at that. You cant blame me for saying that, Seriously, do you except me to say to that? Why did i need to send stuff in like AT ALL since i apparently have a credit report? And if i did then were is the original report that was Supposed to be mailed to me run off to? if i dont have a credit report then why did i receive a letter saying i did have one? If i dont have one then whos credit report did the freeze get placed on? Did equifax XXXX something up and label me as someone else, does someone else have my information? Even if equifax isn't at fault for that, is that the person that stole my identity and equifax did nothing about it even with a credit freeze in place? Imagine how well that would go over in court if that's true!

Btw, if i do or dont have a report is a different issue, The people on the phone have so far been stubborn with helping me so how do i unfreeze the report when ready because that seems like a bit of a problem? You probably got my point by now. Equifax just keeps digging a bigger hole for themselves here and im getting tired of having to try to make sense of equifaxes pointless XXXX. For once someone at equifax should FINALLY do their job. Im at a loss for words here so ill wrap this up. If equifax doesnt figure this out, at least partly then ill see equifax in court. i dont want to go that way but with the way equifax has treated me so far, i dont think id have another choice. WHATS GOING ON!!? Btw, if the person at equifax that receives this cant help me then please pass this onto someone that you think that can help me or even someone as simple as your boss, Id like to get to the bottom of this so please dont just ignore this."
Student loan,"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO. XXXX XX/XX/XXXX RE : Navient Account Dispute To Whom It May Concern : My name is XXXX XXXX and I had a private student with Navient. It originated in XX/XX/XXXX and became default on XX/XX/XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX, I became disabled due to XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I learned about my disability I immediately informed Navient. They did not offer any resolution, so my account continued to accrue additional fees. It was charged off on XX/XX/XXXX and sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  in Illinois. 

I called both Navient and XXXX XXXX XXXX today and was immediately given the run around. I called Navient to see if the statute of limitation had expired on my loan and was immediately put on hold. When they returned they immediately referred me to XXXX XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus. 

Below are the detailed summary of each interaction with each Navient and XXXX XXXX XXXX customer service representatives that occurred today. 

Called XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke to XXXX at XXXX XXXX and he refused to give me the status of the statute of limitation on my loan and referred me back to Navient to get that information. 

Called Navient and spoke with XXXX at XXXX XXXX and she refused to give me the status of the statute of limitations on my loan and said that the credit bureaus would be the ones who could remove it from my credit report and provide the status of my statute of limitation on my loan. 

Called Navient at XXXX and the rep referred me to the credit bear urea and refused to give me the status of the statute of limitation on my loan Called Navient and spoke to XXXX at XXXX who refused to give me the information that I was asking for, after pressuring he said the statute of limitation on this account was not active, but it will be as of XX/XX/XXXX. It was charged off on XX/XX/XXXX and its 7 years after that delinquent date. So, I decided to call back to verify that information and was told the following below. 

Called Navient and spoke with XXXX at XXXX XXXX who referred me back to the credit bureaus and refused to give me the status of the statute of limitation on my loan. 

Called Navient and spoke with XXXX at XXXX XXXX and was told that the account is not a-part of the statute of limitations because its in Missouri. I pushed further and was put on a long hold. She came back and asked me if I have spoken to the state of Missouri. I told her I have and questioned why was she inquiring about that, rather than providing the information that I requested. 

Navient and their treacherous acts and policies are causing borrowers like myself a whole world of credit problems. My loan should be removed from my credit report since the statute of limitation has passed. This account is over 10 years old and they are still reporting on my credit report that I am late. As I told Navient and the collection agency that has the loan now. I am currently getting social security because of my disability. Can you lease assist me with get the true status of the statute of limitations for my loan. The XXXX XXXX XXXX account number is XXXX. 

Thank, XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"We called Wells Fargo Home Mortgage to get a payoff on our mortgage on XX/XX/, the account representative pulled the payoff in the amount of {$450.00}. The representative advised us that we could not transfer the money online ourselves and advised that she would handle this on the bank side. She got the account information but she entered the information for the account number wrong. OnXX/XX/XXXX my husband realized the amount never came out of our Wells Fargo checking account and called Wells Fargo back to find out why. The representative acknowledged their error and fixed the account draft and processed it correctly. The XXXX cleared our bank account on XX/XX/. 

On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo to check on our satisfaction of our lien that had not been processed with the XXXX County Register of Deeds. In NC there is a 30 day requirement to release a lien. The representative advised that they showed the lien had not been released and would send an urgent request to the lien release department to XXXX this paperwork. We were told that a representative would call me with this information. We received no call back. On XX/XX/, we called Wells Fargo back and were advised no additional work had been processed by the lien release department. A case was opened with the executive escalation department. OnXX/XX/XXXX, we called the executive department and received no updates to our request. Around XXXX the same day, a representative named XXXX from Wells called to say he was handling our request. He proceeded to state that my loan was not paid off and that I still owed {$450.00} since the first automatic draft did not complete. While on the phone, we pulled up our bank account and gave the cleared date of our draft. He proceeded to disagree with me even though he had no access to look at our Wells Fargo checking account. We are in receipt of a final payoff letter from Wells Fargo dated XX/XX/ stating our account is paid in full. Our online banking confirms our mortgage account is paid in full. 

Here is our deed information {$160000.00}. Book 2494 page 1761 - 1782 datedXX/XX/XXXX. There is an extreme disconnect from the generation of a payoff letter and processing the release that needs to be investigated. I want this expedited immediately."

First, both SPS and XXXX  assert the property address associated with the alleged note and mortgage as XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX. My deceased father 's last address was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX.

His residence is located on associated Deed XXXX   ( XX/XX/XXXX ). This is all verified by the attached document which includes a very detailed title search report conducted by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The documentation is indisputable and proves the fraudulent and misrepresentation SPS and Beneficial continue to perpetrate. SPS ( AKA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), Beneficial, or any other associated entity has never had, or have, a security interest in my deceased father 's personal residence, which is located on a parcel totally unassociated with the alleged mortgage. See attached documentation for verified proof. Not only has Beneficial misrepresented the facts when they sold the alleged note and mortgage to XXXX, SPS continues to threaten legal action against my father 's estate ( foreclosure, forced placed insurance, etc. ) Furthermore, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and SPS defrauded investors. They have securitized this alleged note and mortgage, without the required due diligence, and continue to misrepresent the facts to investors, by claiming they have a security interest in a property in which they absolutely do not. This misrepresentation is both unconscionable and despicable. Their actions need to be addressed with appropriate consequences."

I adressed these concerns to a man claiming to be the owner of advance finance who told me the federal law does not apply to him. He further claimed that there are state laws that supersede the federal fair debt collection act. I was amazed that a business owner would believe that federal debt collection laws do not apply to a title pawn business. This owner of advance finance then told me he had left a letter in XXXX georgia for me with a person he clained was my mother. I have no contact with my mother nor do i know her whereabouts. This letter supposedly contained personal information regarding my account. I do not have knowledge of any person associated with me currently residing in XXXX  georgia. I feel there have been multiple violations of the federal fair debt collection act commited by this compnay
Debt collection,"I was called by ARS, Account Resolution Services, agent "" XXXX '' at XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I was already in a stressful situation as a company I am in good standing with debited my checking account and I was scrambling to resolve the issue of an overdraft. I informed her that I was unable to pay anything at this time due to not being employed due to XXXX for over a year, and now having this debit on my account that I was not expecting so I had nothing to spare anyone at this time. She then stated, "" Well, if you have debits coming off your account already that is going to be us shortly. So, what are you going to do about it? '' This in my mind implied garnishment of my already dwindling savings as well as any money in my checking account. As my XXXX are aggravated by stress this did not help the already escalated situation. I was on the verge of rash behavior as it was, and this almost put me at the edge. I have sent a written letter to the company informing them of the agents actions, that fact that I am currently in the process of a XXXX claim with court date pending, and that due to the ramifications of that call all contact is to be terminated. The agent in so many words threatened me, and this has caused XXXX. I have not denied the debt, but at this time and until my XXXX hearing, I can not pay and I don't appreciate being threatened."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",In XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX reported to Equifax that I was delinquent for those two months on an account that was paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. If Equifax had done their due diligence they could have verified that what they reported was not accurate. They added a note on my account which affected my credit score and has cause me to have a higher interest rate when applying for home loans.
Debt collection,"After receiving a copy of my credit report, I noticed a debt in the amount of {$800.00} for a former residence of mine. I reached out to the collection agency for validation and received an invoice from the apartment complex. In XX/XX/2018 I took the apartment complex to court for the debt and through Mediation, the amount owed was invalidated. The final agreement signed by all parties shows the complex owed me {$300.00} and I owed them the same amount. This means the amount is negated. National Credit Systems continued to report the balance as {$800.00}. I disputed it with the credit bureaus and National Credit Systems updated the balance to reflect {$300.00}. As recently as 23 days ago they continue to falsely report this acount."
Debt collection,"I received a call from a local number : ( XXXX ) XXXX. They identified themselves as a debt collector called "" hrrgcollection.com '' and asked if I was XXXX XXXX. I said yes I was. They then asked for me to verify my date of birth. I asked what this was about and the caller stated before proceeding they must verify my date of birth. I told the caller I could not provide PII as I had no way of verifying if the call was legitimate. Furthermore I had just checked my credit report the week before and had nothing in my report about any outstanding bill, nor was I aware of anything that may be outstanding as I keep track of all my bills that I receive. 

At that point the caller said he would record that I "" refused to identify myself '' and hung up. However this is incorrect. I had identified myself as XXXX XXXX. When I called back to see if this was a scam or legit. I spoke to another representative and explained to them that I was very dissatisfied with how this first call was handled and that I can't just give out my DOB unless I know who is on the other end of the call and have high confidence that they are legit. She was willing to take my verification of my home address instead of my DOB. And I was OK with giving her that information since my name and address is a public record. 

I did express to the second representative how unhappy I was with how the initial call was handled. However she did not offer an apology. When I spoke to her supervisor to complain he argued with me for several minutes and I asked him why it was that they handled the initial call in the way they did. I asked why they didn't apologize for that. He offered the apology ( after I asked for one ) and when I said it really isn't right that I have to ask for it, he said "" well we're a collection agency ''. 

I did tell him that I need to first verify with my insurance company before I can give out any financial information to settle the account he was referring to as I had already paid the balance of my hospital visit in full and was not informed that there was still a {$36.00} balance remaining. And second that this was a legit collection. 

My complain is two-fold : first it was inappropriate for the first caller to say that I "" refused to identify myself '' as I did do so. Second it was inappropriate to not offer the second verification question as an option, my home address, which the second representative did do when I called back. Third it is this attitude that this collection agency and they can simply treat whomever they call any way they wish. We do not have any obligation to provide them with PII upon request without knowing who they are or if they are legit. Anyone can call me and say they are collecting a bill."
Debt collection,I received notification from my credit report that Consumer Portfolio Services reported that I was late for my car note payments XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019. My monthly payment are due every XXXX of the month. My payment for XXXX is not due until XX/XX/2019. So I am confused as to why it is reporting on my report as 30 days late. I spoke with some one over chat about this and was advised to contact the tradeline department at XXXX. When I contacted this number I was instructed to leave a voice mail message. To date I haven't heard anything from them to resolve this issue. I am requesting that this be removed from my credit report immediately as this is incorrect information.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I paid American Express a total of {$1700.00} in Membership fees this card member year. Due to an unwarranted account closure I am not receiving the spending ability and the associated benefits that I have paid for. American Express stated "" We are unable to credit the Annual Membership Fees In the last year, the Cards that were billed Annual Fees are listed below. These accounts are ineligible for an Annual Membership fee credit '' I am unsure what this is supposed to mean, it is akin to saying "" We are unable to return your money that you have given to us in return for goods, though we have never supplied the goods as promised '' Annual Membership Fees are charged to the consumer so that the consumer is a able to take advantage of the perks and other related benefits of that credit card, not so that the bank can take the consumers money and not provide the benefits of that card. American Express states "" In your complaint you referred to the annual fees you had previously paid on your accounts and that you would like them to be refunded. Per the terms of the Cardmember agreement ( CMA ) that you agreed to when you used signed or kept the cards, the annual fee may be refunded if you voluntarily cancelled your accounts within the billing period the annual fee was billed. Since the accounts were not voluntarily cancelled by you no refunds are due for the annual fees previously paid ''. Practically speaking American Express is stating they can decide to shut down any consumers account after the consumer has paid the annual fee without recourse. To me that sounds illegal and unethical ; to be able to shut down a consumers account at whim after charging the annual fee without having and or proving a valid reason for the shutdown. Especially in my case, where the reason for shutting down my American Express account has been proven false and unfounded. I hope that the CFPB can take the necessary action against American Express for the unwarranted closure of my accounts and for falsifying information"
Debt collection,"A previously deleted account, Portfolio Recoveries collection, was re-reported on my credit report on XX/XX/2019. This has tied me up for a mortgage loan. It showed up last minute when we were supposed to close on the loan. I did not receive any previous notification in the mail that this account was going to re-report and did not receive a chance to request validation on this account. The law says that I need to receive a notification 30 days before it reports for the 1st time and I need to receive a notification within 5 days of re-reporting. I received neither notification.

When I call Portfolio Recoveries, I explain the specific law that they are supposed to follow and none of the people on the phone know what I'm talking about. I was transferred to 5 different reps over 2 hours on the phone with this company. 

The first rep read me a statement about how this debt was past the state statute of limitations and I wasn't able to be sued unless I made a payment or admitted to the debt. I did not make a payment or admit the debt, but when I was transferred to the 2nd rep, they told me that I needed to make payment arrangements today or I could be sued over this debt. So one rep says I can't be sued, then the next rep threatens me with a lawsuit if I don't pay.

What they did was try to trick me to make a payment so that I wouldn't be sued, but making a payment would actually allow them to sue me. This is extremely illegal and misleading. 

This debt was previously deleted from my credit report because it wasn't able to be validated. It's now reporting past the state and federal statute of limitations because the debt collection agency re-aged the debt."

XXXX, Equifax. & XXXX Violation of Sec. 1681n. Civil liability for willful noncompliance : by not providing or listing to me in their numerous responses the name of the third-party that provided the public records on my credit report listed as a bankruptcy in the responses filed by the credit bureaus and the proof of the verified source that has caused me serious financial harm : 1. XXXX XX/XX/2019 2. Equifax XX/XX/2019 3. XXXXXXXX XX/XX/2019 I am outraged these companies continues to maintain a dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy as confirmed on my credit report. This unconfirmed, unverified, and dismissed ( filed ) bankruptcy has stopped me from obtaining credit. I know for a fact your company receives information on bankruptcy from a third-party system known as a Pacer System. The Pacer System is inaccurate and incomplete since the Pacer System does not provide complete social security numbers as that would be against the Fair Credit Reporting Act and Privacy Laws. Furthermore, I have been in contact with the county courthouse and they also assured me they do not report full social security numbers to thirty parties or make social security numbers public record. Even though it is your company 's policy to keep reporting a bankruptcy that is filed, dismissed, or adjudicated for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681 ( c ) relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law is very clear and states from the date of adjudication or date of order of relief. 
Any case, whether it be civil or otherwise, once dismissed it no longer exists in the eyes of the law. This case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. You have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed non-existent. It is only fair that in accordance with section 1618 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act you delete this from my credit report and send me an updated copy. 

Based on the fact that I am an XXXX American, as well as the fact that I have provided these companies, Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX with a copy of my driver 's license which represents my race, I believe these companies have targeted me based upon my race as an XXXX American in the manner in which they have failed to provide evidence of who their "" Third Party!

When Aqua called they didnt bring up the issue of 2 systems. I had my system installed and scheduled the demonstration for my mom. She had to reschedule the demonstration due to doctors appointments. She was notified during this time that she had to have XXXX immediately. After further thought, my mom decided not to have they system installed because extra funds were going to be needed for her care. I contacted XXXX to advise them that we were not going to get the 2nd system installed at my moms. I was told that my 3 days had passed and there was nothing that could be done because the finance company wasnt going to make any adjustments. I contacted Aqua Finance who stated they couldnt resend the contract but XXXX can call them and make an adjustment to my account. XXXX refused. They actually became very nasty. I was told that they could drop the system off and I could try to sell it to get my {$8000.00} back. They said that IF they made any adjustments I would have to pay the fees associated. I said ok, how much are the fees, she said at least {$4000.00}. I laughed and asked why would I have to pay {$4000.00}? She said because commissions were already paid and fees were already paid to the finance company. I said it would be like any other company that makes returns/adjustments to commission checks and financing companies and I refused to accept that offer. We argued for weeks over this. When I said I was going to contact Aqua Finance and dispute the amount with them, I was told that I would be jeopardizing my financing and that Aqua could void the entire contract then the {$15000.00} would become due immediately and they ( XXXX ) would be calling me for a check or credit card for the full balance! What makes this situation even worse is the scare tactics they tried to use. I have made my payments to keep the account current until this issue is resolved.

The credit bureaus are in pure violation of Metro 2 Compliance that specifically says all information being reported to the credit bureaus must meet certain and proper formatting and they do not. Much of the information is missing and this is a Metro 2 Compliance violation. This account with XXXX XXXX is only listing XXXX no one can legally contact XXXX XXXX with such account information and therefore it is incomplete and a major violation. 

2. XXXX XXXX is reporting an account, once again the bureaus say it meets the requirements of the FCRA, I am demanding written proof, meaning a hand signed contract that says this account is mine. I have never had XXXX and yet they are reporting this on my files. Also incomplete and missing information makes it very hard to validate so once again a Metro 2 Compliance violation is taking place. The only thing being reported is a partial account listed as XXXX this is not a valid account number and needs to be removed immediately or send me verification in the form of a signed contract from the creditor showing this is mine.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","A credit card ( XXXX XXXX ) contacted me by phone and by letter to let me know they were sorry about my recent death. I called the phone number on my credit card on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told that one of the credit reporting agencies had given me a credit score of XXXX. Apparently, when you have actually died, your credit score goes to a score of XXXX. At the suggestion of XXXX XXXX, I initiated a credit freeze on my three credit reports and requested that all three credit reporting agencies send me complete credit reports. One of the three had what appeared to be all correct personal information. Transunion has included information about my previous wife, who actually has been deceased 6 years as of XX/XX/XXXX. My first name is "" XXXX '' and then middle initial "" XXXX '' Her first name was "" XXXX '' with middle initial "" XXXX '' When we married, she took my last name as her last name, so the two names are very similar. Under my personal information, they have listed two variations of her name, "" XXXX XXXX '' and "" XXXX XXXX. XXXX. ''"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","We had a series of deaths in our family. This caused some issues paying our bills. I enrolled with XXXX XXXX and let all of my credit card creditors know. They worked out settlments with XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ), XXXX/XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. They are still in the process of working out a settlement with XXXX XXXX. All of theses accounts ( except XXXX XXXX ) are paid in full according to the agreement ( some are with a legal firm ). In fact once we got caught up I paid the balance of the settlement off early with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. Most of these creditors report the accounts incorrectly. For example, most of them are still reporting an "" FP '' failed to pay currently even though there is no balance. Most of them are also reporting the status of the account as derogatory or a charge off. Also, they are reporting that I still owe them money and list that amount as past due. I have contested this with each credit bureau ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and Equifax ). All have come back saying the information is correct so I can no longer contest online. I have uploaded the settlement agreements to each bureau also but they changed nothing. I have sent them letters in writing with no response. I have also sent letters to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. Along with having a full time job we also own an electrical business and are in the process of going for a small business loan. With these inaccuracies it is putting that financing in jeopardy. Credit counseling should be a good thing and if the creditors were more willing you could work out a fair settlement on your own. But when they continue to add multiple fees and interest month it spirals out of control and make it impossible to ever pay back the debt. Attached are a few of the letters I have sent. I can find them all if necessary."

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",On XX/XX/2013 I obtained a cashiers check using {$23000.00} from checking and {$160000.00} from savings. I was assured there was no expiration date. However I was never told about escheating. I realized I needed more funds in my checking so I returned to bank and had {$3000.00} put back in checking and was given another cashiers check for {$160000.00} on XXXX XXXX and was again assured there was no expiration date. Last week on XXXX XXXX I went back and told them I want this cashiers check put back in my savings acct. I was then offered a private clients account ( which at the time I did not know is not federally funded and based in Texas ) Banker had me type last 4 digits of my SSN in her computer or this private client account.She then left with my check several times and was given a number by another employee. Check was run through and she left again with my check. She then went back to her computer and said my check is unclaimed property in Ohio and told me to go home and see if my name came up.I could not find my name in Ohio or Ca where I live.I went back to bank and was told it is Texas. I later found out  the clients acct is in Texas. I also got a case # by phone from Ohio and also the name she was e-mailing to the person in bank which was the same name I was in contact with. I was told another employee was waiting for the e-mail. I was told they would call me back. I never received any calls and my calls have not been returned.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX I was considering refinancing a vehicle I have since paid off. I filled out the XXXX online form to view XXXX 's prospective offers for an auto refinance loan. An individual by the name of XXXX XXXX from a XXXX partner, RateGenius, contacted me on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX over texts. I was not interested to refinance at the time - I was just looking at prospective offers. I opted out explicitly over texts and told him I may refinance in 1.5 months, of which I have proof. Prior to reaching out, on XX/XX/XXXX he sent my application along with my Social Security Number to yet another company ( not a XXXX partner ) called XXXX 's XXXX XXXX XXXX that pulled a hard credit inquiry on my file. I found this out very late on XX/XX/XXXX. I'd like to state this business has qualification requirements to meet to be able to even take a loan from them, found on this site : "" XXXX  : XXXX ''. It is correct to assume I have no such qualifications. I have two issues : 1 ) if I do not recognize or know you as a business, do not touch my credit file, and 2 ) XXXX 's false advertising on XXXX XXXX XXXX   ' : "" When you find a lender that meets your needs and is able to offer a competitive rate, contact that lender and get the refinancing process started.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX, I visited the Worldremit international money transfer website and successfully completed two transactions in the amounts of {$98.00} and {$59.00} respectively to two recipients in XXXX. However, when I tried to log back into my account to make a third transaction, I could not access the website. 

I called their customer service number and spoke to an agent who asked me a number of their security-related questions. I thought some of them were ridiculous since I had successfully answered all questions relating to my identity, and explained why I was sending the money to those individuals. I further explained that it was not the first time I was doing so, that I had made scores of remittances to the same people in the past through XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I wondered why they were more concerned about me being scammed than I was since the money was mine. 

I concluded my argument by suggesting that they might want to consider including all those questions on the form that customers must fill out in order to send remittances. It did not make sense, I argued, to hold up transfer requests just because they did not like the answers to verbal questions they ask customers over the phone. I concluded my argument by suggesting that they consider including a two or three step verification process that will further weed out scammers or thieves and ensure the security of genuine customers because only they would know the answers to the verification questions. 

In response the agent I spoke with said I would not be be able to send any more money through Worldremit. When I asked why, she directed me to an email that was sent to me but that message also failed to explain what exactly I did to warrant being permanently banned from accessing their services. Was it because I criticized their security protocol? If so, what did that have to do with the actual process I obviously followed in order to successfully complete the first two transfers?

We had only missed three payments when they came up with this solution to our problems. My husband and I began working shortly after this plan. When we got caught up on other bills we contacted our mortgage company to let them know we could now make full payments again. They accepted full payments for XXXX XXXX and when we were to make XXXX 's payment they told us they could no longer accept payments from us, because our house was in foreclosure. We could not believe this happened, so we applied for a loss mitigation to keep our home we have done everything for 5 months and they told us they were working with us, but our home is online to be sold and we have people calling us wanting to see our home.

Based on XXXX XXXX my score is in the mid 700 range with a B rating. This change happened within the past 30 days. 

The problem is, that within the last 30 days, I have only improved the balances and account statuses, yet, based on XXXX XXXX resulted in a lower score. The same software was being utilized for many months, perhaps years prior, and seemed to be inline with the other 10 institutions. 

As directed by XXXX, I attempted to contact Transunion to understand their judgment of my worthiness. Transunion would not provide a sensible explanation. They claim it is based upon algorithms. Yet, the same algorithms were in place 30 days ago and my perceived worthiness, if you will, the judgement rendered upon me and my worthiness based on XXXX XXXX, has been reduced in an arbitrary manner, even though my accounts have only improved, that being, the balances are lower, the percentage of credit used to availability is reduced, and the history of proper management has lengthened. 

Transunion said that CFPB are the party responsible for managing errors caused by their software. 

I rebutted that assertion. Stating that there is no reason that a tax payer funded agency should be held responsible for their error, and that there should be someone employed by Transunion who can review this situation to rectify the anomaly caused by on XXXX XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I filed for bankruptcy on XX/XX/XXXX and was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attempted to call and dispute with experian on multiple occassions with no response from them. On my report I have 2 bankruptcies that are shown on experian which are the same bankruptcy. They have the petition for bankruptcy on XX/XX/XXXX and also have the bankruptcy for XX/XX/XXXX. The reference number is XXXX and XXXX cmb. I have explained to the company multiple times that these 2 bankruptcies that they have reported are indeed the same.

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I spoke with the company today and inquired about paying off my loan. I have received loans from this company for over two years so I am aware of how expensive they are. On several occasions when I have called to do an early payoff the representative has offered to waive the finance charge for the pay off. I always call prior to the due date of my loan. That was not the case this time. I had taken out a loan for {$800.00}. I have already made one successful payment on time on XX/XX/2018. I spoke to the manager and the rep who informed me that my pay off would be {$980.00} if I pay on the first. The manager stated that they are able to do so if several payments have been made. So basically after they have gotten more than enough money from you they will work with you. If I was able to make a payment today the manager offered me a discount and said my pay off would be {$750.00}. I also tried to inquire what the actual fee was for XXXX. The rep only told me there is an 485 % apr. Which i am aware of but that is not what I was asking. I referenced their website which shows an example for {$300.00} that payback is XXXX. I feel that there practice is criminal. Especially since I was asking for something that they have been able to do before. There are so many people that get these loans and don't pay them back. I am not one of those people.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have contacted XXXX  and Equifax on several occasions informing them there are several hard inquiries listed on my credit report dating back to 2016 that I did not authorize. I have spoken to over a dozen US reps as well as reps from other countries over the last 4 months. I have explained that my identity has been stolen 4 times over the last 7 years. I placed a fraud alert on each of my reports which are now expired. 

Based on my report there are also several duplicate inquires from the same company around the same time. I asked what is the procedure for disputing inquires that have not been authorized by me? I have been told inquires can't be deleted. I need to send letters to over 20 places listed on my report and have them remove the inquires. I explained that would be very time consuming to write letters to over 20 companies for unauthorized inquires. I also explained these inquires have damaged my credit as well as caused me to be charged a higher interest rate. 

I called and spoke with another rep today and explained to him I will be filing a dispute considering I have been in circles trying to get this resolved and deleted from my report. The last rep I spoke with today from XXXX stated if I get a letter from the CFPB they will delete the records from my report. I will also need to attach a letter requesting the deletion. 

The file number for the XXXX dispute is XXXX. I was told to send the information to the Consumer Contact Department. The turn around time would be 5 days to review and delete. Please delete these unauthorized inquires from my report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My identity was stolen resulting in unauthorized ACH attempts on my checking account. XXXX XXXX closed my checking account due to it having a negative balance from the identity theft. I called to have this resolved and they said since it happened over 3 months ago then they can not launch an investigation.

Debt collection,"I recently checked my experian report and noticed that Midwest recovery system located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, MO XXXX put a collection on my report from XXXX XXXX loan that has been paid off in XXXX.

I tried calling a few times and could not get anyone to give me answers. The web loan was paid in full in the amount of {$650.00} but on my credit report it says i have a balance of {$800.00} in collection which is frivolous and it date back to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which is absurd."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I pay my credit card bills on the day of the due date each month. This has never been an issue with any credit card providers until I signed up for the XXXX XXXX store card by Synchrony Bank. Currently, if I pay this on the due date, I am assessed a {$25.00} late fee for doing so. This has happened twice to me now, as it appears to trigger a late fee if submitted on the due date, but after a certain time. For instance, if I pay it in the morning of the due date, there is no late fee. But if I pay it i the afternoon, there is a late fee. Both times are before their XXXX EST cutoff. Typically, late fees are considered to be detrimental to one 's overall credit score. How can Synchrony get away with charging late fees for on-time payments? It also leads to the question of why are they holding onto this late fee of {$25.00} before refunding it? What are they doing with that money that they essentially took from me without my permission? Are they conducting some sort of a short-term investment strategy with their clients money/late fees? 

I reached out to them to dispute an unwarranted late fee, and they kindly explained that it would be returned since I paid before the due date/time cutoff. They said their system automatically assessed the late fee, and it will be refunded. However, I am not buying that it is this innocent to say, "" sorry, we took your money accidentally, and are returning it. '' On top of that, I had asked if this affects my credit score, as any late fee would. They said they could not answer that question. I do not have proof that it has affected my credit score, but if it does, I will not be a happy customer. 

This is very poor practice, and to be honest I am surprised it is allowed by any credit card company. This needs to be investigated so that Synchrony is no longer able to take advantage of their customers and their money. If their internal software is not able to handle processing same day payments without late fees, then perhaps they should have their ability to operate suspended until they can resolve this."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Just a suggestion - I did write this with breaks between paragraphs, making it easier to read, but they seem to have been removed from the final edit. 

Hello, I am filing a separate complaint against XXXX with the Comptroller of the Treasury, so I am not going to go into the details of how this began ( unless you request that I do, in which case I'll be happy to ). What this filing is about is Experian not correcting information that they can see with their own eyes is erroneous. 

A couple of months ago - possibly closer to three - I filed a dispute against XXXX with Experian regarding an error on my credit report. ( I have not yet seen whether this also appears on XXXX  or XXXX  reports, but I will find that out shortly ). 

While XXXX is the culprit for not reporting over {$3000.00} in payments they've received from me in the last year and a half, Experian is complicit in refusing to recognize a blatant mathematical impossibility. I have received no correspondence whatsoever related to the results of the dispute, not from Experian nor the creditor. I see nothing on the report that shows that any change has been made - no comments, no anything ( I've asked them to direct me to where that is if I'm simply looking in the wrong place, but they have offered no help whatsoever in that regard ). 

Over the past year and a half I have sent XXXX {$150.00} a month ( this figure is the result of a payment agreement I came to with XXXX that they chose to remove me from, but that I nevertheless stayed true to ). These payments have cleared the bank and have been applied to the balance. Yet the report is showing that no payments have been made for the past 20 months! 

I noticed when about to submit this that it says I will not be able amend it later with any documentation. While I'm not prepared to do that at the moment, it really isn't necessary to provide proof of the payments because on the very same report, it shows that the balance has gone down by the total of the payments ( and it will have reduced even further by the time you get to this, as another payment just went out ). Yet XXXX refuses to acknowledge this and has even written off the balance as a bad debt ( I'm assuming that's what "" charge-off '' means ). 

Both things can't be true - that XXXX has not been receiving payments AND that the balance is being reduced. I know with certainty my credit score is suffering from this. Just last week Experian itself sent me an alert that I dropped from the "" good '' to "" fair '' range, even citing the XXXX issue as the reason! 

From here on in, if XXXX would like the reality to be that it's a bad debt that is not being paid down so they can write if off, then they should decline the payments. Or I will oblige them by stopping the payments, but I must hear that from them first. 

As an aside, I am unable to access any of this through XXXX. They no longer send me statements and from what I can tell, have removed me from their customer database altogether - there is no account for me to log in to. This is also something that needs to be changed, so that I can keep a closer eye on things. 

It's no secret that the bureaus receive most of their revenue from the creditors - how the government allows such a conflict of interest to go on is mind-boggling. 

Apologies for lack of brevity. 


Thanks for your time, XXXX XXXX"
Checking or savings account,"XXXX. On XX/XX/2019, I applied for and was subsequently approved for XXXX Premier Checking account ending in XXXX in response to a mail promotional offer of {$300.00} ( there was link on the letter as well as instructions how to get the bonus. Here is the link https : //www.td.com/us/en/personal-banking/checking-accounts/ ). The terms and conditions state that Earn {$300.00} when you receive direct deposits of {$2500.00} or more within 90 days of opening your account.

3. By XX/XX/2019 when it has been more than 90 days since opening the account, the bonus did not post. I contacted customer service for assistance and was advised by the a male specialist that an internal message had been forward to the marketing team to investigate my case. After verifying my successful direct deposit, the male specialist asked me to call again in the next few days to follow up. 

4. On XX/XX/2019, no bonus posted, no reply yet. I contacted the customer service again and spoke to a female specialist, she first verified my eligibility to get the bonus, and suggested me to wait for some additional time. After hearing that I called the other day on XX/XX/XXXX, she looked up my account and found a response from the marketing team. The marketing team says that I used a wrong link to apply and therefore I am not eligible to receive the bonus. Unhappy with the reply, I asked to be transfer to a supervisor, the supervisor didn't do much investigations and just made up some policy saying I am not eligible.

Checking or savings account,"I made a hotel booking through vendor XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018 for booking in XXXX. This booking was fully cancelable for refund until XX/XX/2018. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I found out that XXXX was having issues with bookings - so I inquired and decided to cancel my booking. Upon canceling I was told by XXXX   that they couldn't give me a refund at this time. I notified CITIBANK on XX/XX/XXXX that I had a dispute with the vendor XXXX goods and serviced not received. They gave me a provisional chargeback and sent paperwork to be filled out. On XXXX XXXX the provisional chargeback now appeared on my account as a refund from vendor. I called the back as I had just received the paperwork and asked if the credit was a provisional credit or was it an actual refund from the vendor. I was told by a phone agent with CITIBANK that this was a refund from the vendor. I did not have to send in any paperwork. I asked 3 times - are you sure. YES. I also asked my personal banker - and they said it appears I have received a credit directly from XXXX. Early XXXX - my account goes negative and I am told that CITIBANK has denied my dispute and is taking back their provisional credit. I immediately call and explain what I was told. They said I now have to appeal their decision. I appeal and now receive a letter that i have been denied as TOO much time has passed since my XXXX XXXX purchase. If I am correct - according to chargeback rules - you have 120 days to make a claim. My original notification to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX was within the 120 days. It is the internal bank employees that have misinformed me. CITIBANK has records of my call where I was told it was a credit from the VENDOR. This is an {$790.00} charge where I was framed by the vender and then given bad information from my own bank to fight this. And somehow I have no protection? How is this even fair. They should be trying to collect the {$790.00} back from the vendor. Citibank has made thousands of dollars from me from my mortgage, personal banking account and business accounts and this is how they treat a customer."
Debt collection,"I shared an apartment with a friend and we were evicted. My friend went to court for everything because she's a veteran and was going to receive assistance to pay the back rent, but the apartment complex refused to take the money from the agency that was there to pay the back rent. A year or so passed and I found out that I had this company on my credit as a debt owed for an eviction. I tried to contact them years ago, but couldn't get through on the number provided by the apartment complex. I told the apartment complex and I've written to the company disputing the amount due because it, at minimum, should have been divided into 2 between my roommate and I. I have also since called the apartment complex whom of which is under new management only to be placed on hold and then someone takes a message and no one calls me back. I've sent several certified letters to National Credit Adjusters never to get a letter back acknowledging that they've recieved the letters. I do have proof that letters were sent and recieved on XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of XXXX, I made a settlement offer with XXXX for three payments of {$2600.00} each. This should have satisfied my account in full, even though it was settled. Accordingly, I need XXXX XXXX to finalize my credit report to show XXXX balance, settled."
Debt collection,"I have a statement dated XX/XX/19 from "" XXXX XXXX ''. XXXX XXXX account number : XXXX. Current creditor is listed as "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '', Original creditor being XXXX XXXX. This is part one of the concern : XXXX XXXX is stating they are authorized to accept settlement on this debt, however "" current creditor '' is listed as "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on the very statement that XXXX is stating they can collect settlement on. 

The situation is made more interesting by a letter dated XX/XX/19 from SYNCOM- Synergetic Communication , Inc. Account number XXXX. SYNCOM letter states current creditor is "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '', Original creditor of course being XXXX. SYNCOM letter states "" client '' account number is XXXX which does not match the XXXX XXXX account number so I can not resolve myself with the fact that SYNCOM sold the debt the XXXX XXXX or vice versa. 

This leaves me to believe both companies are trying to collect the same debt. the dates on the letters are too close and the account numbers do not match, so I can not assume this debt was transferred. 

The following amounts are being attempted to be collected from me : SYNCOM says I owe {$640.00} and will accept {$160.00}, IF received by XX/XX/19. 
XXXX says I owe {$1400.00} and will accept {$970.00} IF received by XX/XX/19. 

XXXX XXXX can be reached @ XXXX or XXXX   SYNCOM can be reached @ XXXX or www.syncomcorp.net thank you for your help in this concerning matter.

Mortgage,"I did have a mortgage with XXXX for 28 years. Due to economical problems ( lossing my job ), I went through 4 Loss Mitigation process. At the end, the bank sold the account to a collection agency ( Franklyn Credit ). 
Again, I went through another Loss Mitigation process. I passed the probation process and now, I'm suppose to sign a new contract.

My worry is that the principal balance is {$62000.00} and I do recognize the debt.The problem is that they want me to sign a contract that add the amount of {$26000.00} ( for interest and late charges that were charge by XXXX, third lender ).

Is not fair to paid "" interest over an interest '', or the struggling law for mortgages accept that action for good.In that case, does the collection agency has the right over those interest owe to the previous lender? Since the transaction was for the PRINCIPAL balance.

Franklyn Credit pretend charging me the total amount of {$88000.00}, more than the market value of the house. Do I have any rights? Do I have to pay the mortgage again for 30 years more."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have contacted Experian to remove the inquiries off my record that I dont recognize and told them all of the inquiries doesnt have my WET-INK signature required by Law pursuant to the FDCR Act except for one that I can verify.

After calling and speaking with several representatives, including XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the credit card department and XXXX in XXXX XXXX, no one was able to give me any information nor provide the original signed disclosure stating it was too old to view. Ms. XXXX in the collection department was completely rude, aggressive and disrespectful. Stating that maybe you should actually open your mail then youd know what was going on when I told her I had not received any letters from them about settling a credit card debt. She was very unhelpful and EXTREMELY unprofessional. I Also let them know that they can not garnish wages without a court order to do so and was told its not a garnishment but an adjustment which constitutes the same thing to me because theyre taking everything I have in my checking account to offset a credit card debt leaving me unable to pay bills, childcare and put food on the table for my son. According to 12 CFR 1026.12 ( d ) ( 2 ) For a security interest to qualify for the exception under 1026.12 ( d ) ( 2 ) the following conditions must be met : i. The consumer must be aware that granting a security interest is a condition for the credit card account ( or for more favorable account terms ) and must specifically intend to grant a security interest in a deposit account. XXXX of the consumer 's awareness and intent include at least one of the following ( or a substantially similar procedure that evidences the consumer 's awareness and intent ) : A.

B. Placement of the security agreement on a separate page, or otherwise separating the security interest provisions from other contract and disclosure provisions. 

C. Reference to a specific amount of deposited funds or to a specific deposit account number. 

None of the above were in the disclosure. The security agreement was # XXXX on page 2, was not separate from the other provisions, did not have to initial or sign next to it, and no reference to a specific amount or account was made. This is just preposterous. How are they able to do this? Things like this cause job loss and homelessness."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","EXPERIAN IS IN VIOLATION OF THE FCRA BY PUTTING A STATEMENT ON MY CREDIT REPORT THAT ADVERSELY IMPACTS ME WITH OUT ANY PROOF THAT I ASKED THEM TO PUT IT ON MY REPORT.

I have filed this complaint before as I never disputed anything with the XXXX XXXX accounts. What is funny is that XXXX  removed this comment because they showed no dispute ever being filed by me. But Experian and XXXX  both think its funny to make false statements on my credit report and to violate the law. 

I am now demanding that they proceed by the law. Either produce written documentation verifying that I initiated a written dispute ( Which they cant because they did not recieve one ). I am demanding that this comment be removed completely from my credit report or I will reserve the right to hire a FCRA attorney and sue you in a court of law. I am not playing games here. 
You do not have the legal right to put anything on my credit report that is not validated or verified with proof. You guys have been found not to long ago to have compromised many thousands of people 's information because you are negligent in handling our personal information.

Student loan,"I graduated in XXXX with a BA in XXXX XXXX. After college I struggled for a few years to pay my student loans on time because I did not make enough money to cover the costs of my obligations and expenses.

I have XXXX loans totaling : The original balance on my first loan was {$26000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. Today the unpaid balance is {$24000.00} with an interest rate of XXXX. The original balance on my second loan was XXXX as of XX/XX/XXXX. Today the unpaid balance is XXXX with an interest rate of XXXX. Both of the above loans have estimated pay off schedules with a date of XXXX. What I do not understand is how each loan is reporting a 53 % pay off when the balance has not moved and the dates are estimated. I have tried several times in the past 5 years to call and ask questions about my loans and even requested copies of the note so I could better understand but no one seems to be able to assist me or offer alternative solutions for my pay off plan. 

In XXXX I sold my home and used the proceeds to pay off a larger private loan but I do not see as an option to pay off the remaining balance but I also do not see the balance moving so I am concerned my payments are not being applied accurately and no alternative options have been provided. I paid off a car with a higher interest rate in less time then I have paid my student loan. I need someone to help advocate for me."

After talking to XXXX XXXX, all they could tell me is that it had increase due to inflation and nation wide disasters such as fires in California, earthquakes, etc. Ok, first off I live in Kentucky, no where near any wild fires from California. She said she was just giving examples but I told her that I am in KY and not in California. Asked her if California is in the United States, she replied yes, I then asked her is KY in the United States, she then said yes. I said ok that means what you just told me is natural disasters that happen in California effect my insurance rate all the way in KY. I am so sick and tired of dealing with this XXXX! To be honest I have a lot of stuff wrong with the house as it is that I don't have the money nor the time to fix its not even funny. But here I am paying {$1300.00} a month for a house that's falling apart and wont sell for what I still owe. I might take one step forward trying to do an update on the house by replacing the back doors because they are rotted and falling apart, but right after that 5 more things fall apart right in front of me! It is pretty much impossible to try to sell my house because no one wants to deal with buying a house with a ton of damages. I will probably die before I can even get it all fixed. Its not even worth trying to buy a house unless you win the lottery and you just out right buy a house instead of making payments to a mortgage company. My XXXX XXXX XXXX # is XXXX"
Checking or savings account,"My checking ( and savings ) account is with CapitalOne 360. 
For the THIRD time my payments have been stopped, cancelled or rejected. Each time, I am fined, by the other end ( the company I made a payment to ), in this case it is XXXX, my electric company and my landlord or management company ( where I live! ). The last time this happened it was my student loans and also my rent payment. In ALL of these scenarios, there was in excess of $ XXXX in my account, so this is NOT an issue of lack of funds. 
In each instance, I used my account number and routing number to make these payments -- NOT a check and NOT my debit card. 

In each instance, I contacted CapitalOne 360 ( these calls are all recorded ). I was provided with a case number by the customer service rep I spoke to and then told to submit an email to the "" customer relations '' department. 

In each instance, I did as I was told and submitted an email describing the situation and the fees I incurred. To date, I have received no follow up email, no reply and no assistance. 

Additionally, I was told back at the end XXXX that the issue with using my "" ACH '' for payments was resolved and that I would not have problems going forwards making payments. That was false. Instead I have repeatedly experienced payments -- of a very serious nature, including my rent checks -- being returned for NO reason other than bank error. 

This has caused me great distress and numberous fees. The last time, XX/XX/XXXX, I had to spent my day physically going into a CapitalOne location and purchasing a "" Certified bank check '' ( which cost me additional money, at {$10.00} PER check ) and then take that check to the management. This has been costly and time consuming and stressful! And it is no fault of mine! 

To date, no reply email with the most recent case number, has been received, nothing is ever done to correct or repair or repay me for the situation that thru no fault of mine, I find myself in. The bank refused to put anything in writing, and declines to assist me in any way other than giving me a "" case number ''. And that leads me nowhere ...

Debt collection,"This organization has posted a fraudulently negative collection identifier on my credit report. On top of the fact that I do not recognize this debt, the validity of such a debt would be nullified and illegal as I am a resident of Virginia and have been since well before the purported date of this fraudulent debt. I have, to my knowledge, never had any dealings with this organization or this debt other than attempts made to remove this fraudulent identifier from my credit report. 

As a retired military veteran, I find it personally reprehensible and offensive that this activity continues to be perpetrated against fellow American citizens.

Mortgage,"Rocket Mortgage/Quicken Loans like to do the bait and switch. I applied for a XXXX mortgage loan. I was then contacted by XXXX XXXX who said that he would need to run my credit and upon finishing that, I was PRE-APPROVED! Now to ensure everything would be ready when I found my dream home, I would need to submit all my documents and provide all my personal information to go ahead and close on the loan now. I was quick about providing everything and they even set me up with a realtor to "" start looking for my dream home ''. I decided to download the app to stay on top of everything and found the loan amount to be around XXXX. I immediately called XXXX and asked what was going on because we discussed XXXX but that is not showing on my portal. He put me on hold and "" pretended '' to be confused as well. He then tells me that my credit does not support a XXXX loan and it won't be able to be closed. Why was this not disclosed before I provided all of my personal information and documents? 

I ask XXXX why this happened and why he was not honest about the amount I was pre-approved for and he states that the change happened in another department. What?! It made no sense. Needless to say, I ended my business with them immediately. A month later I get a text asking for permission to run my credit to get me to closing ... .what??? You guys are trying to trick me again, I tell them they do not have permission and that I did not appreciate the bait and switch just to gather my most sensitive and personal information. The "" senior '' specialist named XXXX XXXX said he was "" Sorry I feel that way. '' I informed him it was not a feeling but what actual transpired. I am filling this formal complaint so others are aware of these unethical practices. No one should be lied to, just to gather personal information and then offered almost half of what was originally offered via "" pre-approval ''."
Debt collection,Claimed debt is owed but never heard of the company and never had an account with them. Tried to solve with the company and no success.
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX keep calling both my home phone and cell phone. 
I have no outstanding debts with anyone. 
I feel they are harrassing me and they keep leaving messages that it's "" in my best interest to call them. ''"
Student loan,"Case # XXXX was a prior issue that I had with XXXX. This Case was resolved because a review was completed of any and all eligible payments and my account was updated to reflect the correct number counting towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I was advised that number is one hundred and sixteen ( 116 ) eligible and qualifying monthly installments. I submitted a new Employer Certification Form ( ECF ) in XX/XX/XXXX and my payments XXXX  out on my online XXXX account. I made an additional payment for XX/XX/XXXX bringing my total potential eligible payments to 121. XXXX stated my eligible date of completion was XX/XX/XXXX. I submitted the Employer Certification Form and application for Public Service Loan Forgiveness as instructed by XXXX. I then received correspondence stating my application was rejected based on lack of qualifying payments. I began calling XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX about this issue. XXXX stated I lacked 5/6 qualifying payments. I reviewed my online account and it reflected 5/6 payments remaining. This was the same account that presently showed XXXX  before I sent my application in. I later checked the account again after seeking help from calling representatives with XXXX. My account now showed I had 57/63 remaining payments. I attempted to call on a weekly basis from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX and was told the same thing numerous times. I was advised my account was under review and I would received an answer within 3/5 business days. I would call back after that time passed and was advised the review would take 6 months to a year. I was advised my several representatives and managers at XXXX that my payments could be seen as being paid on my account for the months of XXXX XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised these were the payments not being county as qualifying but my Employer Certification Form was approved and my payments are electronically debited for the amount I was instructed to pay. I was advised by XXXX that it was a computer glitch and I would have to request a payment review ( which I was advised that was happening when XXXX was 1st made away in XX/XX/XXXX ) and it would potentially take a year to review the remaining 5/6 payments. I am at a standstill with XXXX and I have provided everything they need but I keep getting a runaround and I feel I am being treated unfairly because I am trying to apply for loan forgiveness. I also was advised by XXXX that my application is on file and that I would not have to re-submit a new application. I do not feel this is accurate information because I am beginning not to trust anything that XXXX recommends because of the lack of effort and misinformation that I have received. I have attached the prior complaint and recent correspondence from XXXX. The newest correspondence shows that my payments were not counted from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, these are the payments that I was informed that should quality and put my account over or at 120 qualifying payments."
Debt collection,"I entered into an agreement with Radius global the company that XXXX XXXX hired to collect a debt for a vehicle that was reposted. The agreement was to make three payments in the amount of {$1400.00} totaling {$42000.00} to settle and close the account. Payments began in XX/XX/2019 with the first payment in XXXX, second payment in XX/XX/2019 and the final payment was made in XX/XX/2019. I received a letter from Radius Global solution via email and standard mail stating my account has been resolved and closed in XXXX. I contacted both Radius and XXXX XXXX to have the information updated correctly. 

My issue is the information that XXXX XXXX is reporting to the credit bureaus does not accurately reflect the agreement made between me and Radius global and it also indicate son my credit report that I still owe XXXX XXXX  {$6300.00}. I made three payments in XX/XX/2019, XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 on time as agreed with XXXX XXXX however XXXX XXXX reported all three of those payments to the credit bureaus as a failure to pay. Currently the account on my credit report also indicates a past due balance of {$6300.00} despite the fact that I have resolved and paid the full amount all involved parties agree to. 

I am requesting that XXXX XXXX remove the account in totality from my credit report with all three crediting reporting agencies."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My fiance and I decided to jointly open a credit card account. We knew we had big expenses coming up due to an upcoming wedding and figured it'd be a great time to jointly open a new card. 

Our research showed that the Venture card came highly rated from various personal finance blogs we love, including XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXt, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, we applied for and were approved for the Capital One Venture Card. Various articles and Capital One marketing materials we referred to at the time, indicated that we'd be eligible for XXXX bonus miles once we spend {$3000.00} on purchases within the first 3 months. We ended up spending a little over {$4300.00} during the first 3 months. 

However, we recently noticed that we had never received the bonus miles. Upon contacting Capital One and going back to the fine print in the registration email, we realized that the deal we actually signed up for required us to spend {$5000.00} within the first 3 months, a number we just don't recall seeing on any marketing materials. We went on XXXX XXXX to verify what the rewards bonus was at the time we signed up but could only see a placeholder macro { { ESB_AMOUNT } } in place of a specific spending minimum. 

This only strengthens our suspicion that Capital One frequently changes eligible minimum spending and leaves consumers confused on the deal they had signed up for. For your reference, the minimum eligible spending as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) is now somehow back to {$3000.00}. 

We spoke to two different Capital One customer agents ( XXXX and XXXX ) over the phone, who were very firm in denying our claim. Not getting our bonus miles isn't the end of the world, of course. But something just doesn't sit right. If we were gullible enough, there may be other readers who may have fallen into a similar trap. Furthermore, we wonder if other credit card companies also employ similar misleading tactics to lure in consumers. At best, they'd be left feeling short-changed like us ; at worst, they would be in debt they incurred to meet the minimum spending, without the bonus rewards to offset the cost. 

I'd be happy to share more information as the investigation requires. Thank you so much for considering."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had my PayPal account for a few years, when I started doing buisness I switched to the PayPal business account, for all my purchases, and as a place to accept payments for my online store. 
The products I was selling in the beginning were $ XXXX- {$100.00}. 

Recently I scaled my business into a wholesale business and Im now getting $ XXXX- $ XXXX orders. I guess that raised suspicion, with no reason they froze my funds {$800.00} of MY MONEY FROM MY BUSINESS THAT I received, I hadnt shipped the orders out but it had been about 3 days, ( not a long time at all ). 

I usually take 1-2 weeks to ship. 

They wouldnt tell me why they froze the funds they just said we dont think youll be a good match for us any question I asked they said due to security reasons we can not tell you why were closing your account. 

In other words, youre going to have to take your business elsewhere. 

It has ruined my entire business. I was relying on that money for my future customers. AND THAT PLATFORM! 

Theyre holding my money for SIX months! With no explanation as to why!

Student loan,"I am writing in regards to what I feel is an illegal lending practice. Navy Federal Credit Union is attempting to collect payment for a refinance loan before there is any evidence the loan exists or funds have been sent to the prior lender ( the loan being refinanced ). In summary : 1 ) It took two weeks for Navy Federal to process the loan ( I have never had a loan take more than a day and funds have always instantly released directly to me ). This reigns true to a prior Navy Federal refining loan I received in the past.

2 ) I received an e-mail saying funds have been dispersed and a payment on the Navy Federal refinance loan is due in 14 days, yet : There is no loan listed under my Navy Federal Credit Union Loans and Lines of credit accounts.

Funds have not been applied to the loan I was refinancing. 
The receiving bank ( the loan being refinanced ) is XXXX, there is no reason they couldnt accept loan payoff electronically and instantly since this supposed transfer was bank-to-bank. 
This entire process seems strange, as I have had 7 consumer loans in my lifetime and never have funds been transferred loan to loan before, the loan funds were always issued to me, into my bank account. 
Navy Federal is saying it may take up to 30 days for XXXX to process the payment, so now I have two payments due on the same day for two different loans from two different banks on the same {$27000.00} I find it really odd that a payment is due before there is any evidence of a transaction. Typically up to 45 days is the timeframe between loan disbursement and payment due date."
Mortgage,"I Have been under a chapter XXXX that was discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. The HELOC loan I have was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I got a letter from them dated XX/XX/XXXX saying that they have sold my HELOC loan to Specialized Loan Servicing LLC and that they are taking over the loan on XXXX.I am suppose to close on my refinance on XX/XX/XXXX. I have contacted Specialized Loan Servicing daily for the past week and they can not provide a payoff amount yet and are now telling me that instead of XXXX which they originally said they could, now they are saying XX/XX/XXXX!! I also have not received a welcome package from them yet telling me where to send my payment due on XX/XX/XXXX if I end up having to make it, although XXXX XXXX XXXX did say I could get it to them and they would forward it to them. I am concerned about that because of all the bad reviews I see on SLS LLC, as far as them posting payments on time and then charging late charges on those payments that were indeed paid on time. I just want to be able to close my refinance on XX/XX/XXXX as we have planned and am hoping you can urge them to get my payoff amount sent to our loan officer. I can not believe they can't look up that information and get it done for me."
Mortgage,"I bought my property in XXXX XXXX. The originator of the loan was XXXX XXXX XXXX and the loan was provided by XXXX XXXX XXXX. The loan was broken into two 80/20. The loan officer at the time illustrated to me that i was getting into a 30year mortgage with no prepayment penalty after 3years of no delinquent payments. My prime concern then was to be able to make accelerated payments when possible.The loan was then distributed to two different sevicers : XXXX XXXX who later transfered it to chase and XXXX XXXX.Chase took over the 20 % part of the loan and forwarded to me a welcome letter in which they failed to mention the maturity date and also continue to not mention it in any of my billing statements for 14and half years ; it was not until last XXXX they conveniently sent me a reminder of the balloon payment and maturity date. The servicer of the 80 % loan always included the maturity date on every bill which continue to reinforce to me that i was in a 30 year mortgage. Mind you i had no reason to believe that one lender could package one loan with different maturity dates without explicitly stating so to the borrower and there was no addendum to the contract.This reminder caught me by surprise as i had no reason to initially believe that a loan been provided by one bank with emphasis on 30-year maturity date will end up been just for the 80 % portion of the loan and the 20 % term was of a different date. The front cover of the loan clearly stated 360-months, this cover also included the 20-percent portion of the loan and there is no where on that form where the 20 % was designated to be a 180-months loan, and throughout the term of the 15-years period i was not reminded of the balloon payments due in XX/XX/XXXX. I was reminded of this in XXXX of last year that my balloon payment is becoming due in may.Upon closer observation of the contract I detected in fine-print the 15-year maturity date which only appears twice in the whole 40 something page contract. And ever since i have been getting different information from representatives of Chase bank about the maturity date of my loan because on their system the front part of the loan is what is displayed, i was even sent an amortization papers stating XXXX as the maturity date, which is whats on the front cover of both loans. So if their own representative can be confused about the maturity date, you can see why i was too. 
I have been paying my monthly payments on time for the last 15 years. I personnaly feel this is a predatory lending practice. Up to date i have paid close to 60,000 dollars from the initial borrowings of XXXX.And the only principal deducted was a little less than 4,000 dollars bringing my balloon payments to XXXX. This might as well be an interest only loan. 
I sincerely hope your input and service will able to iron out a reasonable resolution to this complaint. I will upload supporting documentation to help you make a judicious advocacy on my behalf."
Debt collection,"Date of telephone conversation : Friday XXXX XXXX, 2017 Name of Company : Asset Recovery Associates, Inc. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX, IL XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Let me first state that I had just recently had XXXX and was not totally coherent when the call came in. I had a very terrible experience. I received a VM message and called them back only to be threatened that if I did not pay ( mind you this goes back 24 years ) that they would notify all my creditors that I am a high risk and that all of my credit cards would be cancelled. I was given two options ( 1 ) accept settlement offer now ( 2 ) if I do not accept settlement offer now, that if I called back, it would not be honored. I advised the person that I felt this was a threat and wanted to check with my attorney. All I was asking to do was to have the opportunity to check with my attorney to see if this call was legitimate and not a scam. The representative kept me on the telephone for one hour 26 minutes making every attempt to wear me down. She finally wore me down and was able to put the majority of the money she was trying to collect from me on a bank transfer and the difference on a XXXX. She kept telling me that a Judge had issued a judgement and that it was going to Federal Court. After serious thought and consideration, I realized that there was no way that a Judge had issued a judgement and was filing in a Federal Court. I then requested a copy of the judgement etc. and she refused to send to me stating that the offer would be off the table insofar as a settlement offer. The representative was very rude, threatening and condescending in her conversation with me. They started out with a 50 % discount if settled now, followed by an additional 3 % for senior citizen discount. They prey on senior citizens in hopes that you will fall for their line of XXXX. I did unfortunately and feel really stupid."
Debt collection,I was just aware that XXXX XXXX XXXX agency reported an account that I allegedly owe in the amount of XXXX to the credit bureaus. I have no knowledge of this account as I have not received any loan for this amount for anyone. I was contacted by this company and told them that I had no knowledge of the debt that I dispute it and I also asked them to please validate the debt in writing as required by the fair credit debt collection practices act. The company failed to do this and they illegally reported my account to all the collections bureaus without validating this account to me.

When I asked the credit company what bureau they used they informed me that it is XXXX.

I called XXXX and they told me there is no credit freeze on my credit report. I requested to get a copy of my credit report. After answering extensive questions for 15 minutes, to no avail I was told that unfortunately you failed the security questions and we are unable to release your credit report to you, please send us a copy of your valid ID and we sill send it to you.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I can not get my credit report because the security questions they ask to log in i dont knoq the answers because I didn't take out the loans its asking about to confirm identity.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I discovered this new account on my collections report and this information is incorrect! This college continues to sell this negative account to different debt collectors giving my PII to random companies and I do not owe this debt! this is my second time disputing this same information and I will be seeking legal action for fraudulent charges. I do not owe this college any money I withdrew the correct way I returned all materials and I have never stepped foot into any of their classrooms this is a fraudulent charge and I refuse to pay or have this negative information reported on my credit report.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is regarding the Fed Loan DEPT. I have new proof that they were not suppose to get my new servicer, XXXX XXXX to add in any direct plus loans from my daughter 's college, XXXX College XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in with my consolidation loan I did with XXXX XXXX. I received an email from the "" Borrower Defense Refuns Cancellation DEPT '' that if I requested the loans for this college to be put on freeze, this is allowed until the investigation against this school for frauding loans, allegelly, has been determined. I have contacted XXXX XXXX to change the online consolidation back to remove al of the loans from XXXX College or I will cancel it ... This isi my right as the consolidator applicant. 

I will provide proof from this dept. Also, the Fed Loan dept. responded to my letter that they had already frozen the loans due to them being under investigation. I never spoke with them about having problems with these loans in regards to needing help with payments! It was about why so many were requested only! 

Also, if you review the total expenses of the college during my daughter 's one year enrollment which was from XX/XX/2017 to XX/XX/2017, review the copies of her financial aid summary that I provide, ( not from the financial aid office since you may not be able to trust unless you comopare their statements with mines ... ), you can clearly see, she had enough financial aid form grants, scholarships, Stafford loans not to need the amount I am now showing that the school borrowed & are trying to make me repay by sneaking them on my credit report & in my consolidation! Some nerve! It is clear that the amount of the tuition & other expenses deducted by the financial total amount she had doesn't equal the amount of loans they got which is {$130000.00} in direct plus loans which exceeds the {$55000.00} limit of this kind of loan anyway! No way they can not be found with no fraudulance. Even the amount of the loan only has a {$55000.00} limit. Please, tak note of this.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The mortgage account currently being reported was updated XX/XX/2019. In XX/XX/2019, we applied for a refinance of said mortgage l, but had to remove a HELOC loan, that was discharged in a bankruptcy in XX/XX/2019, cleared from the title. The lien was immediately cleared but now the credit report is currently reporting the entire mortgage discharged in bankruptcy, which it wasnt. The mortgage was reaffirmed on almost 10 years ago. Due to the inaccuracy of reporting the correct information, we were declined a refinance. I have disputed the inaccuracies with Experian and reported the inaccuracy to XXXX, but to no avail. Do to the recent and extensive negative impact upon our livelihood, I am going to attempt to resolve this before retaining legal counsel. Please advise."
Debt collection,"Navient has failed to provide honest & adequate services to its borrowers. It seems they are constantly dishonest about the structure of their company, and do nothing to help people that are making increasing efforts to make payments or proper arrangements ( that are not only in the best interest of the company, but for the millions of borrowers that are struggling to make their payments every month, without feeling vacuumed by student loan debt. 

I am constantly being told misinformation, and there is always lack of detail as far as your current loan and your options to make things more comfortable for the borrower. They have denied every request I've made for help : refinancing, releasing co-signer, making structural payments every month that would make an impact in decreasing the debt. 

I've been paying for nearly 5 years now, and my balance is still the same! I've made arrangements throughout the years, they feed you lies so you think your arrangement will serve you well, if you're consistent and make substantial payments, etc ... but it appears to me the money you pay literally goes into their pockets, your balance remains the same from when you started 5 years prior, and NO, you are not eligable for help as far as refinancing, or even trying to structure a payment plan that would be in the best interest of the borrower. 

I was told that they could not set up a plan that would benefit me long term. It was up to me to "" overpay '' the balance, and therefore the remainder will go towards the principal. I asked for a financial advisor, or someone in accounts receivable that could possibly help me break down my loan that will serve my best interest, make an impact on the principal and possibly divide a percentage of both principal and interest that would actually start to decrease my balance ( which is stagnate for over 5 years, while paying nearly {$600.00} a month on a $ XXXX loan ) ... they told me they have no such department that would do that, they transferred me to "" Customer Service XXXX who didn't care to find a solution, just repeating "" facts '' like a robot, and telling me he didn't understand my questions. 

I'm disgusted by their company work ethic and lack of honest service. I can't believe that this is legal."

Debt collection,"Security Credit Services is stating they purchased a debt from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Attempted to explain original creditor is XXXX. Security Credit services stated they are the same company but operate under a diffrent name. I asked them to provide a document that I signed but they said they couldnt do that unless I was starting a fraud investigation. Told them my uncle is an attorney and he stated under section 623 the debt collector and original creditor has to provide valid proof of said debt.

Mortgage,"I am in foreclosure mediation with Flagstar Bank. I am requesting and have been in the process of applying for a loan modification. I have become concerned with discrepancies in the verbal and written information I have been given, as well as numerous other problems. This led me to research Flagstar. In doing such, I became aware that they are under a consent agreement with you. The violations they are under consent agreement for mirror the problems/behaviors that they are engaging in with my case/file, IE closing out the file inappropriately, not communicating requests in a timely manner, unwarranted delays in processing, etc. I have proof of all of the above and more. I am fearful that Flagstar bank, which is headquartered in Michigan, is going to issue an unwarranted denial of my loan modification. Oddly enough, the underwriter I spoke to there told me, on a recorded line that his job "" XXXX '' and he has too many files. This overloading is one such item of MANY that Flagstar was ordered in the consent to correct. My home is very important to me and I do not want to be issued a denial because of these internal issues. My spouse and I have the income to sustain our home and we will pursue all avenues available to do so."
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2018 my mortgage was sold to a new servicer - Citizens One bank. Shortly after the sale, monthly payment amount went from XXXX to XXXX ( I was unable to get a clear explanation as what the reason for the increase was ). Since I had automatic payments set up with my Bank ( XXXX ), I continued making a monthly payment in the amount of XXXX for two months after the increase took effect. 
Rather than billing me for the difference, Citizens One, who discovered the problem in XX/XX/2018, decided to refund my two monthly payments (!!! ) and then started making threatening calls to me, claiming I was about to default on my mortgage. I had to make an emergency payment of XXXX to make my account even. 
The two payments of XXXX were refunded by ( physically!!! ) mailing 2 separate checks to my home address - each in the amount of XXXX, one on the XXXX and another - on the XX/XX/XXXX. Naturally, one of these checks got lost and despite me calling Citizens One numerous times for a replacement check, none was sent to me. It has been nearly two months and I can not get my money back! 
I find it absolutely outrageous that this kind of unprofessional and borderline fraudulent behavior is tolerated - Citizens One is clearly incapable of providing quality service to its clients and should not be allowed to service consumer loans."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",This account is paid off but is being reporting in the status area and comments area that it's charged off. I have spoken to 3 individuals at XXXX XXXX and faxed over letters and screen shots showing what is being reported to the credit agencies. Neither Equifax or XXXX XXXX will fix this problem. This has been on going for close to a month and half between both organizations. Each placing the blame on one another.
Mortgage,"After a period of rapidly demising remuneration due to technological obsolesence I lost my last job in XXXX XXXX   just over two years ago. At aged XXXX it is not easy finding another one. Nevertheless in the last quarter of XX/XX/2018 both my wife and became employed. That income along with a pension, social security and additional fees for professional services rendered should by all expert accounts justify a mortgage modification. The servicer - Select Portfolio Servicing Inc is proceeding with a forced sale despite the fact that they are still considering a restructuring as they repeatedly ask me for data that I have already submitted. I do comply promptly with their requests.

It is very challenging to establish enhanced lines of communication with them given no real relationship manager and written correspondence that completely contradicts that which I have been told on the phone. 
I think it perfectly reasonable for both parties to delay the enforced liquidation until a more thorough examination is made of the additional financial resources being introduced in an attempt to work collaboratively with the servicer."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","To Whom It May Concern : Both Equifax and XXXX began to report an unpaid debt on my account in the amount of {$130.00} to XXXX XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/2018. This is stunning, since XXXX checked into my dispute regarding this account and removed it immediately. Both Equifax and XXXX, however, refused despite several phone calls and dispute filings. I do not owe that company any money. I have never missed a credit card or loan payment in my entire life, and these credit reporting companies have now reported an unpaid delinquent debt that cost me about XXXX points on their credit report. I asked the credit reporting companies whether there is a judgment against me of any kind with respect to this debt. Neither Equifax nor XXXX  could find any such judgment. Nevertheless, they stated that XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed I owed money, and that was the end of the inquiry. I asked why my statement that I did not owe any money would not be held in the same regard as that company 's statement. But these companies had no valid answer. 

Furthermore, XXXX  continued to add a suffix to my name that does not exist over my objection. Equifax did the same thing. I disputed this with them, but only XXXX  fixed the error. Equifax refused, demanding personal information, which I was unwilling to send them due to their record of records ' breach ( which impacted me ). They stated one company ( out of XXXX accounts ) reported my name as XXXX., and they would take that company 's word over mine and that of XXXX companies. This was stunning, and to this day, the company continues to hold me out as someone I am not. 

I hope you can fix this!

Mortgage,"I have filed this complaint with wells Fargo twice. They have not answered my questions. 

Please refer to complaint XXXX and XXXX. There has been no explaination as to the XXXX and what the charge is for. They want me to pay this 12 years after the mortgage was initiated? NO DETAILS of what the fees are for. I want itemized documentation. 

Wells Fargo never confirmed that taxes were owed by owner. Just assumed because they got a notification from XXXX county that taxes were due. When I spoke with Wells Fargo on the phone I was told by one of the 5 people I spoke with that they were billing for XX/XX/2018 taxes. Wells Fargo never contacted me by phone. If they has spoken to the 5 people that I spoke with they would have had my current phone number. These taxes were in dispute because the attached picture was left behind my home causing it to be on the market for 4 years and never selling. If there was ever a next time doing business with Wells Fargo I would just hand them back the keys to the house and let them deal with it instead of being responsible. I am waiting for my explainations as to my original questions that I have listed above. You should have contact with owners. By the way, the paper work you sent was old mortgage info. It was refinanced so again no answers by Well Fargo. I am still  waiting."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XXXX I submitted a request for validation and verification of dismissed bankruptcy reporting on my credit report from XXXX  XXXX.

I notified them that with my original request I had included a letter from the court in question that states they do not verify, validate or report any information to CRAs or any other furnishers. When I asked for the source to whom performed this verification / validation, I was told they do not disclose that information and that they are not obligated to do so.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","So all 3 Credit Bureaus continue to ignore my request for dispute by not completing a full dispute, its kind of disturbing to know how a credit bureau can complete a dispute in less than 5 days. That tells me the dispute is not being done correctly and not being done in accordance with the law and my rights. This complaint has been created because there is two issues with my credit files that keep getting ignored. 

1. The credit bureaus continue to allow XXXX XXXX XXXX to report false numbers to them, I due not owe an outstanding balance or am I late or ever have I missed a payment. The loan was restructured and while it was being restructured the false numbers where being reported, I am current with XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was a victim of fraud and forgery while using my American Express Credit Card. I am writing to plead for assistance from The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and ask for a thorough investigation with American Express, as they are condoning, disregarding and quite frankly encouraging fraudulent behaviors from their vendors/merchants. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my American Express credit card was charges 11 times for a total amount of {$8800.00} from a merchant named XXXX XXXX. I only authorized/signed for 2 charges - {$190.00} and {$1000.00}. I contacted American Express immediately once I noticed the pending charges. In speaking to the agent/representative, we were convinced the charges were an error as there were numerous and duplicate charges minutes apart from each other. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, all the charges posted and I immediately contacted American Express. The agent explained to me that they will open a billing dispute/inquiry with the merchant and made me feel comfortable that the charges are inaccurate and AMEX will get to the bottom of it. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email with an AMEX Message. The message was a note from the merchant stating that I am a regular customer and a copy of 5 out of 11 receipts. I have never been to this establishment prior to XX/XX/XXXX. I reviewed the receipts and noticed my signature was forged on 4 of the 5 receipts ( the {$190.00} receipt being the only one I signed/authorized ). I did not authorized nor was I aware of the 4 other receipts. None of the descriptions on the receipts decipherable. Once again I immediately contacted AMEX, and explained them the charges were fraudulent and my signature was forged. They transferred me to the Fraud department and I was assured that AMEX is going to initiate a thorough investigation. 

On XXXX XXXX, I called AMEX looking for a status update and an update on the remaining receipts. The agent/representative explained to me the investigation is still pending and they have not received the additional receipts. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned a call to the Fraud department as they left me a voicemail. The agent/representative from the Fraud dept. explained to me that the fraud team will not investigate this case because I was present at the establishment with the card. The agent/representative requested I contact customer care to continue to investigate the case. I did not understand how this is not fraud as I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged. I was told by the agent on XX/XX/XXXX that this was fraud and she transferred me to the fraud team. If this is not fraud I do not know what is Either way, I then contacted customer care again and the agent/representative explained to me that there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route. I was so devastated and disappointed with the agent/representative approach and response that I had to end the phone call. I took some time to compose myself from the disappointing way the previous agent/representative address the situation. I called back a few hours later and requested to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor ( XXXX ) came on the line and immediately repeated the same message the previous agent/representative provide me ( there is not much more AMEX can do for me and to figure out an alternative route ) without listening to my concerns. I explained to her that I do not feel this was handled accordingly from AMEX from the very beginning. 
i.e. 
How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other There are 4 separate cases/inquires open and the agent/representative could not explain why 4 were open vs 1. They could also not explained why 1 was closed out the other 3 were still open nor can I decipher why The agent/representative agreed this was fraud and transferred me to the Fraud dept., the Fraud dept. did not even investigate the case even though I did not authorize these charges and my signature was forged The agents/representatives and supervisor could not provide me any updates on the case or updates on the remaining receipts on every call I made to customer care.

There was a credit on my account for {$1100.00} ( {$390.00}, {$290.00}, {$290.00} and {$190.00} ). Two agent/representative could not explain the credit and the supervisor ( XXXX ) stated the credit was from the merchant b/c of the duplicated charges. Shortly after this was explained to me, I receive an email stating the credit is being reversed. 
Communication and updates have been poor and inadequate The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) At this point, I contacted and engaged the District Attorneys office to notify them of the fraud and unjust business practice from this merchant. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I send an email to a member of the American Express Leadership team, to express my concerns on how American Express has managed and addressed the investigation/matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from an American Express Executive Assistant, stating they have received my email and are reviewing my inquires and concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from the same American Express Executive Assistant, with an attached resolution letter stating We have extensively researched your concerns and determined all claims were investigated and correctly decisioned, because of the fact I was present at the establishment. Their outcome of all claims resulted in the following credits : {$1900.00} ( Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code ), {$500.00} ( tip amount from the {$1500.00} charge ), {$400.00} ( tip amount from the {$1100.00} charge ), and {$80.00} ( tip amount from the {$200.00} charge ).

I responded with my concern that this was not thoroughly and extensively reviewed as they stated. And requested a call to discuss the actions and steps that were taken to extensively research my concerns. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to the same American Express Executive Assistant, to review and address my concerns. I ask a number of questions and what steps/process were taken regarding how American Express came to their decision. She was very abrupt and refused to answer specific questions. Her common response was You were at the establishment. I explained to her that their vendor/merchant had possession of my American Express Credit Card for the duration of my stay at their business. During that time span, they processed 11 separate simultaneous charges without my authorization. They then provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. Because I was at the establishments does not mean I authorized the charges. Below are a few of the concern I attempted to discuss with the American Express Executive Assistant to no avail. 
Why was I, nor the vendor/merchant, not physically contacted ( Called ) during the investigation Did American Express review the Merchants history An explanation of the Charges ( I can not decipher the descriptions on the receipts And the merchant would not return my call ) Why certain tips were credited and not others. 
o Her explanation was, any receipt with an X marked on the line for a tip would be credited. 
o There were receipts with X marked on the tip line that were credited and not credited o She stated she will look into why there was inconsistency on American Express 's part with the credit issued for the tips Why was only one charge of {$1900.00} was credited.

o She states the Vendor/Merchant entered an incorrect authorization code o I requested the purpose and meaning of entering the authorization and she refused to explain it to me.

Why did I not receive all of the requested receipts until weeks/months later from American Express ... I requested them numerous times and they finally provided 10 out of the 11 receipts to me in batches when they clearly had all of them from the beginning. ( I am still missing 1 receipt including the receipt I signed for {$1000.00} ) I received endless inconsistency with the credits provided. I was provided numerous credits on separate occasions and then the credits were removed on separate occasions. As a matter of fact, shortly after my call with the American Express Executive Assistant, where she went through and confirmed my credits, I received notice the same credit is being removed.

Inconsistent messaging form American Express employees o The numerous/separate cases caused inconsistent responses/messages from the customer care agents every time I called in. The Communication and updates were poor and inadequate. Each Customer Care Agents provided me a different and inaccurate update or were not able to provide me any updates at all.

The signatures and handwriting on the receipts are visibly and clearly mismatched ( Please see attached ) How AMEX allowed 11 simultaneous charges minutes apart from each other, while the vendor/merchant had possession of my Credit Card. They provided you 10 receipts with signatures and handwriting that are visibly & clearly mismatched and forged. 


I am pleading with The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate this matter. The fact that American Express accepts/allows this vendor to provide dishonest business practice and fraud to any patron is unacceptable, disturbing and frightening. How can American Express support, allow and accept this merchant to continue to provide unfair, dishonest and fraudulent business practice in our community?

I have contacted both XXXX and B of A on numerous occasions and advised that I was never sued separately on the alleged deficiency balance due. The New Jersey law listed below was explained to both XXXX and B of A. It was ignored by both parties. The New Jersey law listed below clearly states a separate lawsuit must be filed in relation to the deficiency balance to be valid. 

Deficiency judgments are allowed in New Jersey, but not in the foreclosure action itself. To obtain a deficiency judgment, the lender must file a separate lawsuit within three months after the foreclosure sale or, if confirmation of the sale is required, from the date of the confirmation of the sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-1 through 2A:50-2.1. ) The court may limit the amount of the deficiency judgment if the borrower disputes it. The borrower may dispute the amount of the deficiency by answering the lenders suit and introducing evidence regarding the propertys fair market value. The court will then limit the deficiency judgment amount to the difference between the debt and the fair market value as of the date of the foreclosure sale. ( N.J. Stat. Ann. 2A:50-3. ) Neither XXXX nor B of A filed a separate lawsuit to bring the alleged debt to a valid status per NJ State law. This alleged should have been extinguished 3 months after the foreclosure sale date took place. However, both XXXX and B of A, have proceeded with aggressive collection activity and have reported the debt to my credit bureau report. XXXX and B or A are in violation of the FDCPA, FCRA and independent NJ State Laws. Since your agency regulates these laws, I am seeking your assistance on this matter. You can reach me at XXXX or XXXX."
Debt collection,"Original debtor was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The last payment I was able to make to XXXX XXXX XXXX was of {$50.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. Before the my ex-husband and I became XXXX and lost our house to foreclosure during the economy crisis of XXXX!!!

My employer provided a letter to me saying that {$320.00} will be withheld beginning XX/XX/XXXX per pay period which is bi-weekly.

The amount the debt collection agency wants to collect from my paychecks is absurd and at no given time have I acknowledged anything with them. Plus 10 years have passed since I last made a payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX. and 6 years have passed since Asset Acceptance , LLC filed the judgement that has been removed from my credit since XX/XX/XXXX. I also currently have a XXXX plus debt in student loans that I am responsible for to whom I only pay {$100.00} a month because of my household size and income.

Credit card or prepaid card,"A charge from XXXX XX/XX/XXXX was charged to a deceased person 's account. This individual has been deceased for over seven months. Her daughter ( me ) handling her affairs was unaware of the card 's existence until the statement was received in the mail. Upon calling XXXX I was unable to provide them with necessary information to locate the account nor reverse the charge. 

I called the credit card company and they refused to reverse the charge because the card was "" closed after the charge occurred. '' Their estate department claimed they would proceed in trying to collect on this charge. While only {$120.00}, I find this ridiculous and appalling. How can you charge a dead person? 

I hope you can help, because the hour I spent trying to talk sense into them did not work. This all occurred today, XX/XX/2019 around XXXX. I spoke with XXXX initially who referred me to the estate team. XXXX in estate services. 

XXXX XXXX, supposedly a supervisor for XXXX, who gave me an id # XXXX who said that they would reverse the charge and transferred me to their dispute department. XXXX in XXXX, TX in the dispute department who said they would not reverse the charge, dispute the charge, and initially tried to say the account wasn't closed, and then said that the account was closed after the charge occurred therefore making the charge valid. XXXX refused to transfer me back to XXXX and stated that the id # given meant nothing. XXXX refused to transfer me to a supervisor. 

All names and information given about the people is all they would tell me. I did call back and speak to a random operator in the call center who verified that XXXX meant nothing to them and could not get me to XXXX XXXX."
Money transfers,"I registered with Transfast.com and initiated the transaction on XXXX XXXX, 2016 Thursday XXXX EST to transfer {$500.00} to be remitted to my XXXX account. The remittance was urgent and Transfast was providing remittance in 24 hours to beneficiary 's bank account if the transaction was done using the Debit card so I chose it that way considering the urgency. I understood that Transfast put a holding authorisation for {$500.00} immediately in my account and send me the transaction detail over email. I called them around XXXX EST XXXX to understand if everything is smooth with my transaction and if they need to verify anything just to ensure that the money gets credited to the beneficiary 's account in timely manner. Their agent verified the necessary but refused to credit the money to beneficiary 's account immediately and instead asked me to wait till the end of 24 hours. Unfortunately, they did n't credit the money to beneficiary 's account even after 24 hours so I 'd to call them again inquiring about why did n't they do it even after assuring me earlier. They did n't answer me and instead asked me where am I calling from?! I told them that is irrelevant where I am calling from and instead answer why my transaction is not thru. They told me that I was misinformed by the agent earlier and they can do the verification. I told them that the agent did verify my detail, I also offered if any further verification is needed to which replied negative and only after that assured me that the transaction will get thru so why asking verification again now when it is already more than 24 hours and even if they verify the necessary once again, how will they ensure the money gets credited to beneficiary 's account because it was about time ( late ) the XXXX banks would stop processing the bank deposits for the day and the next is weekend! Transfast agent hung up on me and also cancelled my transaction in the name of me refusing to verification that they did n't even care for 24 hours and even when I called them, if it was due as they said!!! They even refused to have received any email from me when I sent them 3 email in 24 hours after Initiating my transaction. 

I tried calling them repeatedly to complain, no responsible person was available. They work from XXXX.I manage to reach out to their Manager XXXX. He looked at all my email and apologized that their agent did n't do the job but I 've no option but to initiate a new transaction only since the previous one is cancelled. I asked him how will he ensure the beneficiary will get money the next day to which he had no answer. He asked me to call him back in 1 hour and he will try to find some way out. 1 hour later, I called him again and asked him Transfast offers cash pick up so they can offer me that. He said it is available for a diff type of product but I could see on the website that it is available to the same product I used. He refused stating even though it is on the website, they are not offering it. 

He said, all he can do is have the transaction verified immediately as I place it and while we were talking the phone got disconnected. When I tried to call again, he went on break. I tried to reach him to no avail. I tried to initiate a new transaction but realize that even after cancelling the prev transaction, they did n't remove the authorization on the funds and I ca n't do new transaction until the previous authorization is removed.I 'd to spend 3 hours with bank and Transfact to have it removed as they did n't care.Finally, when I was ready to initiate a new transaction, the XXXX XXXX was not available to supervise as everybody was telling me for 3 hours that he is in meeting which was absolute lie.While I was following with Transfast since XXXX, I 'd their Director XXXX XXXX with me.She assured the necessary but did n't do it and cancel my XXXX transaction also!

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is potentially a giant scandal. 

After the XXXX  hack, I took the liberty of freezing my credit on all three reporting agencies. 

This past week, I attempted to open a new line of credit with XXXX but was informed that my credit was frozen and to call TransUnion, because they have a relationship with them to expedite the process. 

I called TransUnion and they asked for my PIN number to unfreeze my credit. I do have my PIN on hand, but just to see what would happen, I informed them that I lost my PIN, is there anything I can do? 

To my huge surprise, they said yes, and by answering a few security questions on my credit report, they can unfreeze my credit. 

THIS. IS. NOT. GOOD. 

What is the point of freezing your credit with a PIN if it can be accessed anyway without a PIN? The answers to those security questions on that credit report can easily be found with enough XXXX. 

THIS MEANS that the whole illusion of securing your credit with a PIN is FALSE. 
And this illusion of security will only lead us down the same path as it did with XXXX, with a data breach and the answers to those security questions. 

THIS MUST BE FIXED! 
I am considering reporting this to major news outlets.

Debt collection,I have contacted the creditor/company many times but they have failed to provide me with necessary documents that will prove this account or debt belongs to me and it has resulted in loss of credit rating.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hi, I initially reported all of the fraud on my TransUnion credit report on identitytheft.gov, and according to the FTC 's instructions I sent TransUnion a letter indicating which debts were not mine, and that I was a victim of identity theft. I received a letter from TransUnion indicating that they will not investigate the identity theft and fix my credit report. I spoke to someone from the FTC and they said that under FCRA ( a ) "" Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. "" I literally fulfilled all of the 1-4, and even provided the FTC identity theft report. According to them in FCRA B, they rescinded to block the fraudulent information. Honestly, I don't know why they did this, and I didn't benefit from this fraudulent activity. My credit is ruined, and my home buying process is delayed due to this experience, and my credit cards have been affected by reducing my credit line. All of this experience has been horrible. Today I called TransUnion customer service due get clarification to this letter, and the agent advised me to get letters from each creditor, and send it to TransUnion. As of date, I have not received any letters from any of the creditors to fix my credit report, and as a private company all TransUnion does not follow FTC rules. Also, under FCRA 605 C, "" ( 3 ) Significance of block. For purposes of this subsection, if a consumer reporting agency rescinds a block, the presence of information in the file of a consumer prior to the blocking of such information is not evidence of whether the consumer knew or should have known that the consumer obtained possession of any goods, services, or money as a result of the block. '' Seriously, how could an identity theft victim receive any benefits? My credit report is wrecked, and TransUnion refuses to follow the law to recuperate my identity."
Credit card or prepaid card,I was notified by First Bankcard that my account was closed due to delinquency reports on my credit report. This report was an incorrect report that has since been corrected. See attached letter to confirm.
Debt collection,"I previously filed a complaint with the FTC on XX/XX/2019 about this phone number. My complaint reference number is XXXX. I have received 2 more voice mails from this number since that date on approximately XX/XX/XXXX, and Again today, XX/XX/XXXX at approximately XXXX. 

Company has left a total of 3 voice mails on my phone. Although I know the individual this company is attempting to reach because we are a couple for over 30-years, I am not him. 

The message says that it is a personal message for the person the company is attempting to reach followed by an disclaimer stating if I am not that person I need to disconnect. Unfortunately, since the call rolls to voicemail, it does not disconnect. When I played the message for this individual, it indicated that by continuing to listen to the message that this was confirmation that I am him. Furthermore, it indicated it was an attempt to collect a debt and he must contact the company immediately. 

This individual and I are domestic partners and have a home and children together. As a result of the call, we went through our correspondence and conducted credit checks to see if either of us had any outstanding bills or blemishes on our credit. Neither of us did. All of our bills, including medical, are paid in full. In addition, no bills have been sent to our home, to either myself or him indicating a past due balance. Thus, I suspect this is either a scam or an error. However, because no correspondence has ever been sent to our home regarding past-due balances for anything, we will not be contacting this number. 

When I researched the phone number, I saw several comments about people receiving robocalls from this same number. All had similar issues. Some indicated when they called the number, the person answering started demanding all sorts of personal information, which is suspect. 

Furthermore, if any unpaid medical bills are due for either of us or our children, we would both expect to receive an invoice or correspondence from the entity that is owed the money indicating the date of service, the amount due, any adjustments or payments made, etc ... Not a phone call that relays suspect information and sounds like a scam."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have contacted XXXX ( inquiry XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX XXXX ( inquiries XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), and Factual Data ( inquiry XX/XX/XXXX ). I let each of these companies know that I did not recognize the inquiries that THEY placed on my credit report. I asked each company to provide me with a written consent from me indicating that I agreed to the credit inquiry. After several hours on the phone getting nowhere with each of these companies and getting the runaround, I decided to send a formal letter to them ( each letter is attached ). I have found that most of the companies that are reporting information out on my credit report are receiving their "" inquiry '' from a 3rd party and are not the actual furnisher of the data. This fact makes it even more imperative to see the written approval with my signature."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I would like to request the suppression of the following items from my credit report, which are the result of my falling victim to identity theft. This information does not relate to [ transactions that I have made/accounts that I have opened ], as the attached supporting documentation can attest. As such, it should be blocked from appearing on my credit report pursuant to section 605B of the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
Credit card or prepaid card,"About 14 years ago, I deposited {$600.00} for a secured credit card with US Bank. I have been using this card ever since until XX/XX/XXXX when I called the bank and informed them I wanted the account closed and my deposit refunded. To my surprise the bank informed me that my card wasn't secured anymore and was operating as a normal credit card. US Bank claimed to have refunded me the money back in XX/XX/XXXX. I am adamant that no refunds were ever received from US Bank. I then requested documentary evidence or a paper trail that clearly shows a check from US Bank or funds were deposited in my account. 

The bank is unable to provide any evidence citing an obscure law that allowed them to destroy banking records after 7 years. They request that I take them at their word and they got no reason to lie to me. I find this very insulting. Its a brazen attack on my intelligence! I called the bank again today XX/XX/XXXX to no avail and spoke with XXXX in Underwriting. 

I also left a message for a manager called XXXX and she called me back stating her agreement with what previous employees had advised me. They stated my only other hope is to write a letter to their US Bank President or send fax. The President cant be reached by email or phone. Their goal is to make it harder for consumers like me to get their issues addressed"

-CAPSTONE HAS INSULTED ME ... by saying ''It appears he is mistaking the amount of time an account may remain on a credit report with the statute of limitations for legal remedy. '' ....

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I disputed enormous accounts on my credit file, on XX/XX/XXXX I  received a letter back from the credit reporting agency stating the debt was verified as accurate. After much frustration I then sent in a letter requesting the method of verification used to identify these enormous accounts as indeed belonging to me. I clearly stated my right according to FCRA and also asked for names, address, and phone number of the furnishers they spoke with, I also that they respond within fifteen days. I sent my letter through certified mail and it has been well over 15 days since they have received it without any response from the credit reporting agency which I believe is a complete disregard to comply with the FCRA laws. 

Update : I received a letter in the mail about 30 days after I requested a method of verification. It was the same exact letter that was sent to me when I first disputed the accounts. Saying they opened another dispute which I didnt ask for and that the accounts again are verified as accurate. Please help me. Thank you."

Unfortunately, the documents that are provided with this complaint does not state or show a signature of me agreeing to release anything dealing with my medical information or records to any third party company.

Debt collection,"I have two credit cards that were suddenly sold to a debt buyer known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am here to state that the two original creditors, hereafter known as Synchrony Bank and XXXX XXXX XXXX did not sell these two credit card debts. That is an impossibility since all credit card debts for both of these financial institutions securitize their debt portfolio into XXXX dollar plus securities agreements. XXXX XXXX XXXX is running a huge scam that is being pushed by national banks to offset losses on their quarterly 10Q filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, I need both of these collections rescinded immediately unless transfer from a securitized trust can be proved. Both financial institutions need to be brought up with sanctions by the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Accordingly, I demand proof that a transfer of both of these original debts were assigned out of their respective securitized trusts. If that evidence can not be proved, then both debts must be forgiven and files must be purged. XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"SUBJECT : RETURN OF FUNDS FROM DOUBLE MORTAGE PAYMENT IN MONTH OF XXXX On or about XXXX XX/XX/2019 I authorized a monthly ACH draft from my XXXX XXXX checking account for the purpose of paying my mortgage to Freedom Mortgage. By XXXX XX/XX/2019 I had not received any form of written communication from Freedom Mortgage that verified the ACH draft would take effect. Therefore, on XXXX XX/XX/2019 I paid my mortgage payment via my on-line banking with XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XX/XX/2019 I finally received a letter ( dated XXXX XX/XX/2019 ) from Freedom Mortgage that stated my ACH draft request had been processed and that my XXXX checking would be debited on XXXX XX/XX/2019. I immediately called Freedom Mortgage and was told that it was impossible to stop the ACH draft on that day, and that I should attempt to stop the payment of the draft by my bank ( XXXX XXXX ). I called XXXX and asked that the draft not be honored. XXXX XXXX took all the pertinent information but stated that if the draft had already executed, it could not be stopped. And it was not stopped. 

Therefore, it is clear that I made two XXXX mortgage payments to my loan with Freedom Mortgage ; one was in error. I need one of those payments returned to my XXXX XXXX checking account. Both I and my wife are retirees and live on a very fixed income and budget. The {$2200.00} that made the second XXXX mortgage payment are the funds needed for our living expenses and other bills for the entire month of XXXX. 

After speaking to a Freedom Mortgage representative by phone on Friday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I faxed to Freedom Mortgage the information above and a copy of my XXXX XXXX checking account information showing both payments had posted ( been paid ) to Freedom Mortgage. The Freedom Mortgage representative had provided me their fax # XXXX, which I used. On Monday, XXXX XX/XX/2019, I called Freedom Mortgage Customer Service # XXXX to inquire as to the status of my request for return of one of the two XXXX payments I made. I spoke with XXXX, id # XXXX, in XXXX, Indiana. I was first told that once the request had "" been processed '', a check would be sent to me. I asked why an electronic transfer could not be made directly to my checking account. I was put on hold for several minutes. I was then told that "" XXXX '' had told XXXX that once my fax "" had been found '', she would have an electronic transfer made to my XXXX XXXX Checking account, and that would take 5-7 days. I expressed my disbelief that an electronic transfer takes 5-7 days, and asked to speak with XXXX 's supervisor. I was again put on hold for several more minutes. I was then told a supervisor was not available I requested to make an appointment with a supervisor and that request was denied. The supervisor in question is "" XXXX '', also in XXXX, Indiana. In the final analysis, I received no confirmation that my fax had been located, nor that I would receive my funds any time soon."

Wells Fargo refused to let me remove my name from the account that was linked with my husband at the time. I started trying to call WF XX/XX/XXXX to learn what this debt was. XX/XX/XXXX they sent me a packet of bills with an address different than what it should have been. They advised the card was opened in XXXX. This is the year I left my marriage and started banking with a new bank. I looked at the charges and didn't recognize them. Some of the charges were in a different state than I lived in. I called to advise them of this and they said they would open and investigation. I waited about 2 months and didn't hear anything back so I called again. They advised no investigation was ever started. They put me on hold for 45 minutes as they were "" looking into it '' then hung up on me. I called back. They advised that they could see an investigation had been started and I would hear from someone. I asked how I would hear from them and they couldn't answer. I had to force them to take my new contact information. I waited 2 more months and again heard nothing. I called back again but this time to the corporate office. They listened to my complaints about nothing ever happening. Assured me an investigation would happen and that they would personally call me back. They confirmed the address that the address was opened in and I advised that was NOT my address at the time. They also said that my name was the only name on the account. I never received a call back but I did receive a letter and a check for {$270.00} for all of my trouble. I was advised that it had been removed off of my report. I thought it was done. A couple of weeks later I received a letter stating that my report was denied and they found it to be my debt. I called and told them I wanted proof and they told me they couldn't provide me with proof that they didn't have to and that they were going to put it back on my credit report. I contacted the corporate office again and complained. Again they assured me that the case manager would reopen the investigation and that she would personally call me back. They told me to wait until XX/XX/XXXX and if I hadn't heard from her to call her directly. I have called her several times and she will not return my call. I received a letter from her stating the debt is mine only this time they sent completely different invoices before and this time they have my then underage daughters name on the account as well. I have called multiple times to ask someone about the discrepancies and they refuse to call me back or provide legitimate proof that this debt is mine. I am fully aware that Wells Fargo was in a lot of trouble for their employees opening credit accounts in customers names without their permission. I don't know if this is what happened but they won't even acknowledge it. They keep saying it's my debt but refuse to speak to me on the phone or show me proof. I am extremely frustrated."

These payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX for {$300.00} and XX/XX/XXXX for {$1300.00} and covered the total debt I had with the University. The representative was very short with me and extremely rude. She hung up on me and denied me access to speak with a supervisor regarding my account. I inquired about the process for removing the account from credit report once the balance has been paid. The representative stated that the account will first report as paid in full and then two weeks later it will be removed from all three credit reports. I asked could I get a statement in writing confirming this and she noted that Ability Recovery Services would not be able to furnish a written statement. I have repeatedly asked to escalate mt concerns to a supervisor and the representative continued to say "" I am not going to go back and forth with you or transfer you ''. The representative has noted that unless I am calling to make a payment she will not speak to me. I also have reason to believe that the representative who identified herself as XXXX XXXX, lied about her name. Based on the voicemails I have received from "" XXXX '', her voice and accent sounds exactly the same."

I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how XXXX, XXXX and Experian verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through eOscar. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a law firm, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. 
Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call XXXX back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All XXXX major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently obtained a copy of my credit report. It indicated that a credit inquiry was made by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 the day before I even showed up at XXXX XXXX dealership, which is an affiliated company. This inquiry was not authorized by me and appears to have been done in a nefarious manner. I authorized no inquiry until XX/XX/2019 when I came to the dealership, when XXXX did a credit inquiry for a second time but with their true name XXXX/XXXX XXXX/XXXX  short for XXXX   XXXX. Therefore, I am writing to dispute this inquiry and have it removed from my credit report. 
It was done in a nefarious and discreet manner to avoid detection. I spoke with the affiliated company XXXX XXXX, whom I have never had any dealings with and they told me that their credit inquiries are under the name XXXX XXXX XXXX. They are also located four hours from my home and I have had no dealings with them. 
The XXXX dealerships are saying that they do not know where this inquiry came from and EQUIFAX has been of no help. I have sent them my drivers license and a 1099R to identify myself and they still will not talk to me. I did put in a request to have this inquiry removed but i have no ability to check to see if this has happened. I should indicate that i became "" locked out '' of my credit file after filing a complaint with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Equifax would not even tell me why they wouldn't talk to me. AND WHEN I ASKED WHO I WOULD COMPLAIN TO ABOUT EQUIFAX, THEY TOLD ME THERE IS NO REGULATORS WHO WATCH OVER THEM. JUST COMPLAIN TO THEM. I knew that could not possibly be true. In addition, i was asked several times for my social security number, and it was repeated with other people in close proximity to the person taking my call. I could hear them. It sounds like an overseas operation and i question why they insisted on repeating my social loudly."
Credit card or prepaid card,I was shocked when reviewing my credit report and found a late payment on the dates below : Inconsistent dates below- 30 days late as of XX/XX/2018 ( XXXX ) 30 days late as of XX/XX/2018 ( XXXX  and XXXX ) I am not sure how this happened. I believe I made my payment to you when I received my statement. My only thought is that my statement did not get to me.
Credit card or prepaid card,"My credit card had a fraud of over {$500.00} in XX/XX/2018 and I promptly closed my card and asked HSBC to not renew it. HSBC registered a fraud complaint on my behalf and started investigation. Later they found that the transactions were actually fraud and sent me a letter explaining about it. 

About 90 days after this incident, I received communication from HSBC that I had not paid back my credit card amount and should expect a dent in my credit score etc. When I contacted customer service, they explained the situation in detail. They explained that while the fraud charge was under investigation, the bank was expecting me to pay the amount back. Since, I did not make any payment, they levied late fee and interest on my account. Thereafter, once the fraud complaint was resolved, they removed the fraud amount from account but the late fee remained. Then, on the next cycle, they added more late fees as the account still had a balance and continued to do so for 2 more cycles. They informed me that this should not have happened in the first place and that they'd credit back the full amount to my account and it would not show a balance. They also apologized and sent a letter explaining the actions. 
However, in the very next cycle, I saw one more late fee charge and also saw their credit. I contacted the customer service again and the new representative said that I needed to make the payment and the credit was not enough to offset the balance alone. I went ahead and made a payment and they immediately credited me back the amount paid. Amidst all this, they maintained that the whole fiasco should not have happened and apologized for it. However, by this moment, they had already reported the effect of late fees to credit agencies dropping my credit score heavily. 

I am a diligent credit card user who has always paid it back in time, without a ding in my history. However, this incident is making me suffer a bad score through no fault of my own but the sheer negligence of HSBC who did not communicate anything clearly and left me frustrated with the whole system altogether."

I was told by the mortgage company that I had to be at least 3 months be hide before the could do anything for me. After my savings were gone which was months later I filed for a modification. I sent in all required documents and made all three trail payments. After that I was told by my account manager that I had completed everything that I had to do and now the underwriters had to process the modification. I called every month to get an update. Finally, I was told to make two payments to bring the mortgage current and my modification would be finalized. I made the two payments and called the mortgage company back in two weeks. At that time my account manager informed my that he had giving me the wrong information. I was told that I had to pay over 20K ( the arrears ) to bring my mortgage current or loss my home. I wrote upper management and explain the issue. Management was extremely rude to me. And now I an in the process of losing my home. This entire experience has been long, hard, misleading, stressful, inhumane, unethical and unprofessional. I hope that no-one never has to go through this awful experience from Bayview Loan Services LLC. This mortgage company needs to be accountable of their mistakes. Because the way they do business is negatively effect hard working people 's lives in a major way."

Checking or savings account,"Suntrust bank dishonestly and erroneously stole a total of {$100.00} from my checking account. On XX/XX/XXXX, a deposit of {$340.00} was made to cover a withdrawal to my sons ' college education fund that was scheduled on the same day. Suntrust falsely noted that the deposit was made on XX/XX/XXXX - even though I have a receipt indicating that the deposit was made on XX/XX/XXXX. Suntrust then charged a {$36.00} overdrawn fee even though the account became overdrawn only because Suntrust made a mistake by not crediting my account on the right day ( June 18 ). 
Because Suntrust erroneously charged a {$36.00} fee, there was not enough money to cover a check of {$15.00} that was paid the next day ( June 19th ). Suntrust then levied two additional {$36.00} overdrawn fees. In other words, Suntrust 's mistake in the deposit date caused three overdrawn charges amounting to a total of {$100.00}.

XXXX, a company with no listed phone number, no website and a single publicly disclosed employee has accumulated 46 properties in Philadelphia through foreclosure proceedings. 

It has flipped about 10 of those properties. In one instance, XXXX foreclosed on XXXX XXXX XXXX, a newly built townhouse in a middle-class neighborhood of Philadelphia, for just {$65000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, two months after it had picked up the mortgage at a DASP sale. Another two months later, having made no major improvements to the property, XXXX resold the same house for {$170000.00}. 

These are in the minority of properties, however. In the majority of cases, private equity firms appear to mainly sit on the properties they accumulate, sometimes for years. If DASP buyers are renting out their new assets while they wait for home values to appreciate, many do not appear to be doing so legally : Out of dozens of properties owned by XXXX analyzed by City & State, none had received a rental license. 

City & State reached out to both HUD and  RoundPoint for comment on multiple occasions, but received no reply from either entity. 

XXXX councilmember XXXX said she believed this process is increasing the number of vacant and rental properties in urban neighborhoods, in addition to other stressors. 

When you have homeowners who are evicted or who lose their homes, that has dramatic consequences for a city like ours that already struggles with poverty, she said. We have affordable housing waitlists that take years and homeless shelters that are overcrowded. We cant fix it all. 

It doesnt have to be this way. XXXX  is part of Local Progress, a network of local elected officials that has pushed for reforms to programs like DASP. In XXXX, HUD announced that it would make an effort to steer more distressed mortgages to nonprofit buyers, who would ideally be more forgiving towards impoverished homeowners. Nonprofit mortgage buyers, known as community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, were previously outbid on 98 percent of DASP sales.

I did not know what this was. I called the number on my bill and i was informed that I needed to call the card security service directly. The number was provided on my statement. When i called card security, they were very receptive and explained to me that I have been charged for this service since XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that i was not aware of the service and that I did not sign up for the service. I also asked how this was presented during the application process and if it was represented clearly, i would not have agreed to it. The representative immediately reversed the charges going back to XX/XX/XXXXand it was a little over {$2000.00} credited within a week. She provided me with a case number of XXXX.

I realized that since XX/XX/XXXX i have been paying finance charges to Synchrony Bank for the charges from card security. I contacted Synchrony Bank and explained the situation. I spoke to two representatives who did not understand the over all situation.

Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been charged financed charges of 27.99 % for this transaction. I explained that this should be reversed. I also explained that I do not challenge the interest rate, but I challenge the finance charged on this transaction that should not have been charged to begin with. 

Operator # XXXX ( XXXX ) could only credit me back 2 months of interest rate charges. I explained to her that i have been charged more.

I was denied an option for a lower payment - my monthly payment was increasing from XXXX {$540.00} to XXXX {$630.00}.

Option 2 - Send in a principal curtailment of {$0.00} in order to reduce my current LTV to 80 % and pay {$120.00} for a certificate of value ( appraiser picked by XXXX ) Neither of these options were in accordance with the Homeowners Protection Act ( HPA ). The HPA requires a servicer to automatically terminate PMI for residential mortgage transactions on the date that : The principal balance of the mortgage is first scheduled to reach 78 percent of the original value of the secured property ( based solely on the initial amortization schedule in the case of a fixed rate loan or on the amortization schedule then in effect in the case of an adjustable rate loan, irrespective of the outstanding balance ) if the borrower is current. 

My loan is current and below 78 % of the original value. However, nobody at XXXX can explain to me why my PMI has not been cancelled other than to tell me I have to order an appraisal or get a certificate of value. Nobody can explain why they are not operating in accordance with the HPA or why my mortgage is not governed by the HPA."

I have spoken with numbers representatives, supervisors, and managers in regards to the erroneous public record and I have yet to get it resolved. This is my 14th dispute in which I am currently awaiting results. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke with a representative and inquired how Equifax, XXXX and XXXX verifies their public records. I want to know this information because the public record keeps coming back as mine. I had 20 representatives that told me that the request/dispute is sent as a message to the courthouse through XXXX. Once the court verifies it, the information is sent back to the credit bureau. I advised that I would like to cancel that dispute and they advised that because the dispute was already sent to the courthouse, I will need to contact them with my name and the case number. Being that I work for a XXXX XXXX, I know the court system and their procedures, but decided to call anyway. 
Contacted the court and they advised that they do no disclose, release or verify any information with the credit bureaus or any 3rd parties. I decided to call Equifax back, spoke with another rep this time and they advised that the information is verified by the runner who goes to the court house. I asked what information does the runner give to the courthouse, and how and what kind of physical information does the runner give back to the credit bureau. They could not answer that, and I requested to speak with the manager. Manager advised since this is a re-investigation, no runner is involved. She advised that they use a form that they send over to the courthouse. I asked what type of form and where is it sent because the courthouse confirmed that they do not verify any information with the bureaus. All 3 major bureaus refuses to give my physical documentation ( whether tangible or electronic ) that they use to verify this these accounts are mine."
Debt collection,"Convergent XXXX, a collection agency, is contacting me to try to collect a cell phone debt that they previously accepted a reduced balance over 2 years ago. They tried this tactic last year and when they were told to stop because they accepted a reduced balance, they said they would not contact me again. Now they have called me on my cell phone and sent me a notice, again offered a "" reduced balance amount. '' Convergent XXXX clearly does not honor reduced balance offers. They must rely on the fact that the balance was paid so long ago that I do not have document to prove what I paid and the notice they sent."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I tried to open a savings account. My application was denied due to Experian putting a freeze on my credit report. I tried calling them to unfreeze my report but could not reach an actual person.

I called 6 different phone numbers for Experian and was routed into the same automated messaging system each time. I tried using their website to unfreeze my account. I entered all of my information and hit submit only to get a response back that states "" We are unable to process your request '' and "" If you need further assistance please call XXXX.

Many of these dear people have lived on the streets for years. One problem I have found is that they are often stuck in a cycle that prevents them from getting a job or housing.

The cycle is they attempt to rent an apartment or get a job but fail because their credit is bad. They then remain homeless and jobless until they can try to repair their credit report. 

There needs to be a process that allows the homeless person a way to get their credit report prior to seeking employment or housing. I have checked your site and you require a Social Security number, address and Birth date to get a credit report. The individual has the social security card and birth date but no address. 

What can a person use that is a legal document to submit in place of the address to prevent Identity Theft? There needs to be a solution to this problem. This issue affects thousands of US Citizens trying to get their lives back on track. 

I have searched your website but there isnt any information to address this issue. I tried your contact numbers but they do not provide access to a customer service representative to allow this question to be asked.

Student loan,"My complaint is with XXXX University, their deteriorated reputation and their recent campus closures. I think XXXX should absorb the cost of my education and interest as I am concerned that the degree is now useless. 


I am in frequent contact with my lender but have never been able to afford my payment as my loan debt is now over $ 200k ; with a 6.5 % interest rate, my interest accrues at about $ 1000k/month leaving me little chance to ever pay down the principle. With my XXXX education costing double what my XXXX and XXXX degrees COMBINED cost and now rendering it useless, I think XXXX is in breach of contract and that loan debt should be transferred to XXXX. Please see my below statement for my experience with XXXX University, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 


While I am a graduate of XXXX with an XXXX in XXXX XXXX, XXXX increasingly negative reputation and press has rendered my degree worthless. In light of the recent campus closures ( I attended XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX campus ), the integrity of my degree has been severely impacted and will no doubt, have a profound impact on my future employment opportunities at the XXXX level. 

Fortunately, I earned my XXXX XXXX from an accredited state school program that has allowed me to find employment at the XXXX level. In the process of onboarding to this position, I was advised by my current HR department that my XXXX degree could not be verified so I was hired ( and paid ) at the XXXX XXXX level. They use the XXXX XXXX   Database for degree verification and XXXX is not listed, therefore, my XXXX degree is not recognized and has not been valuable or useful to me in that regard. 


When I enrolled in XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I feel I was misled in how XXXX presented its credentials and academic rigor and felt extreme pressure to accept admissions immediately. I learned of XXXX program through an XXXX Board Member ( who was one of my graduate school professors ) who said he could "" get me in '' and wrote a letter of recommendation on my behalf. 
Throughout the admissions process, their recruiter led me to believe that there were admission standards and hurdles that I was clearing, and pressed me to make a decision swiftly. 


During the admissions process, I inquired about XXXX accreditation and was told they were in the process of renewing it and expressed confidence that it would be reinstated shortly. I don't believe XXXX ever accredited my program. I was rushed into making a decision and fast tracked to the financial aid department. At several points during my education, I expressed concerns to the department chair ( who was literally a different person every year as it appeared they could not retain faculty for more than a year ), I was told that the onus of responsibility fell on me to understand licensure requirements and I could not get an answer as to whether or not the program would be sufficient for licensure. At the time that I enrolled in XXXX in XXXX, it had a decent reputation, but it quickly became clear to me, as well as other faculty I was working with, that XXXX changing policies and standards were unsavory. After the negative press of XXXX, in which XXXX was targeted for predatory lending and admissions practices, I knew that I had become involved with an institution with a tainted reputation. I attempted to transfer but learned that my 3 years of coursework would not be accepted and was advised to quickly complete the program, which I did. 


I am furious about the amount of debt I have accrued with a degree that held little value then, but now has no value in light of XXXX 's recent campus closures. I can not see any legitimate hiring agency recognizing my advanced degree coming from XXXX ; I don't see how I will be able to work in the field at the XXXX level. 


I am an intelligent person and not easily taken advantage of, yet in hindsight, I feel embarrassed and angry that I find myself in this situation. I am in need of guidance and help to address my current concerns. I have over $ 100k in student loan debt from XXXX alone, double what I accrued from my XXXX and XXXX degrees combined. It was an incredibly expensive program that failed to deliver what was promised - an accredited program that would prepare me for licensure at the XXXX level. I am ashamed that my name is associated with this institution and will have to eliminate it from my resumes and curriculum vitae to spare my reputation that I have worked so hard to establish. It is completely unjust that XXXX can close and leave a wake of student and alumni victims feeling angry and helpless. I can not obtain my transcripts and course catalogs to verify my coursework, yet I am neck deep in loan debt that I can not begin to chip away at. 

Now that XXXX is closed and again in the news, I do not think that I can attach my name and professional reputation to this program and be taken seriously as a XXXX. Incidentally, I worked as the XXXX County XXXX for 9 years, developing a sound reputation within the community. I left to pursue academia where I quickly learned that the academic world does not recognize XXXX as a legitimate institution and have been pursuing employment at the XXXX level. 


I was encouraged by the XXXX XXXX XXXX to reach out to my local congressional office to seek some support and hope that Congress can establish some means to protect XXXX victims."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Under Maryland state laws statute of limitations, as well as numerous disputes with each credit bureau ( XXXX, XXXX, and ESPECIALLY Equifax ), each bureau was notified of my being in the security breach in which is involved in a class action law suit. There are NUMEROUS accounts in collections that are not mine. There are also NUMEROUS accounts in which I am an authorized user, wherefore requested by each credit issuer and notification to the bureaus to be removed from these accounts - specifically but not limited to XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. XXXX, in particular, after sending a dispute would almost immediately update to dispute completed, thus, clearly ignoring my dispute without investigation. Equifax hasnt failed to investigate any and all disputes due to the breach and thus, leaving open accounts and collections that are not mine. I have provided documentation on numerous occasions to all bureaus. XXXX has fixed and resolved a few - but not all. All three bureaus have also left accounts from over 7 years ago on my credit report after asking them, per my rights by FCRA. Furthermore, there are accounts from XXXX, wherefore, XXXX has put in writing to remove all and every late on two different lease accounts in which no bureau has done so, even after supplying the notice in writing due to errors, again violating my rights. Since the breach, I have come across numerous accounts that are not mine. I have had to pay for and try to rectify these accounts and after months of doing this, the bureaus are refusing to acknowledge my proof. I have received NO notices of completion in writing, aside from an update via email from XXXX  - which they sent within 24-hours, clearly not investigating my accounts in sufficient time. Therefore, I am requesting that because of this formal complaint and a clear violation of the FCRA laws. 

In addition, there are two child support collections on my report, wherefore, a court magistrates order was to delete the accounts from my report, which was provided to each bureau. One bureau did, in fact, rectify this by updating the account to fully paid ; however, they did not follow a court order which clearly states to have both account removed from any and all credit reports due to the fact that we were in litigation for child custody when this went down."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",i obtained a copy of my credit report and seen erroneous information. so i proceeded to challenge the validity of the information. i have not received any information of investigations from the credit bureaus or the collection agencys reporting these debts. they are not abiding by the law and this kind of behavior is unacceptable. i can not obtain a job or take care of myself or my family because of the false and misleading information placed upon my credit report.
Mortgage,Originally my loan was with XXXX. I lost my job and asked for a loan modification. I went to consumer credit counseling for help. XXXX had so many modification applications at the time they had outsourced some of their work. Anyway they mislabeled my loan lost my loan application and this continued for a couple of years. Instead of a modification they started foreclosure proceedings. I ended up filing bankruptcy. My mortgage was included. Then after a few years of paying my bankruptcy payments XXXX wanted the amount increased. I was paying XXXX a month they wanted XXXX a month I could not pay that amount so my case was dismissed. I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get this done. We called several times a month before the bankruptcy and after the bankruptcy was dismissed. They finally came back with XXXX left on my principal balance and were supposed to be doing a modification. In the meantime I received a letter from Shellpoint mortgage saying they were servicing my loan and it was XXXX. We called XXXX and they told us that my loan had not been sold or transferred and that they were still working on a modification. Well it had been sold and Shellpoint had started foreclosure proceedings. I called them and told them what happened and I contacted my attorney to file bankruptcy again. But they stopped the foreclosure and agreed to do a modification. I did the trial period and the paperwork came back with my principal balance being XXXX. I disputed the amount of my principal balance. They told me if I didnt sign the modification that I would immediately go into foreclosure. I said I would sign the paperwork to avoid foreclosure but I disputed the charges. I contacted the Alabama attorney generals office for help. Shellpoint told them that the charges were from the missed payments from when XXXX had my loan. I explained to Shellpoint that XXXX agreed that all I owed was XXXX and they were supposed to do the modification which Shellpoint was fully aware of anyway. My first paper statement from Shellpoint reflects my principal balance being XXXX. They still refuse to remove the charges of over XXXX making what I owe more than my original loan and have sold my mortgage to XXXX mortgage servicing. Also when I called Shellpoint to tell them that making the payments on the first of the month might be a problem their agent told me that Shellpoint doesnt consider a payment late if its made in the month its due. They sent me a nasty letter threatening foreclosure even though I was never behind and added late payment fees to every payment. But that didnt happen until I sent them messages requesting the other fraudulent charges be removed.

The person I spoke to said it would be updated in 5 business days. After 5 business days, I called again and they said the fax was not uploaded and attached to my disputes. This is preventing me from getting a mortgage. The other two credit  bureaus have updated my balances for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. Equifax is the only one that refuses to update even after I have supplied them with proof. I am working two full time jobs to pay down debt and improve my credit score.

Checking or savings account,"NOT A DUPLICATE COMPLAINT I am a customer of Bank of America and a fraudulent transaction in the amount of {$100.00} was posted to my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX. I was not aware of that fraudulent transaction until I went to the branch on the same day to make a cash deposit in the amount of {$92.00} and noticed on my deposit receipt my available balance was showing - {$0.00}, so I went inside of the branch and the representative directed me to call Bank of America and file a dispute and he would return my {$92.00} cash, however that refund was not done by the branch representative. I spoke with XXXX on the phone and filed the dispute, however, Bank of America is holding my temporary credit in the amount of {$100.00}, stating that since I had other claims in the past, they are not going to credit my account on the regular timing until they finalize the investigation, that could take up to 60 days, instead of 2 days. I spoke with several representatives since XX/XX/XXXX which includes XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) and on XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX, but nothing has been resolved and every time I call and a note is put on my account by a representative, the situation is becoming harder to resolve. I asked several times to speak to a manager about this situation, but all the representatives above have refused to transfer me to a manager. Yesterday when I spoke with Bank of America, I was asked to wait until today to have the transaction completely posted, since the transaction was still processing and I would receive a temporary credit for that dispute once it completed or dropped out of my account. Today the transaction is showing posted and I was advised by all the representatives I spoke with and XXXX XXXX that Bank of America is going to hold my temporary credit due to other disputes I filed in the past. I also spoke with XXXX in customer services, but she started to display some angry behavior on the phone as we started to talk, so I thanked her and ended my conversation with her immediately. Bank of America is disregarding that the {$100.00} fuel charge posted to my account on XX/XX/XXXX is a fraudulent transaction and not a merchant dispute and needs to be handled seriously and on a timely manner, since my funds are being held on the fraudulent transaction. I have been treated by Bank of America representatives with disrespect and unwillingness to resolve my issue."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Not as if it comes with or as a big surprise but during the process of Obtaining two separate school loans I was led to believe that my payment would always remain manageable and that I would have nothing to fear when graduating only blue skies ahead however I was fraudulently led to believe that the payment would not adjust and yet it did and skies became quite a bit more gray. I am aware of the US government is suing XXXX XXXX XXXX and many other entities For fraudulently issue in student loans without disclosing variable rates against the fair lending credit act end it is a violation of the fair credit reporting act to report such fraudulent loans on my credit. I have opened disputes to ask for original amount of the loan an original signature is agreeing to those amounts Yet all three credit reporting agencys failed miserably and following the FCRA in verifying those facts with XXXX XXXXXXXX.
Mortgage,"First Citizens Bank did a construction loan in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I did the grading for their new home which was completed in XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a lien with the XXXX County Clerk of Superior Court on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX, Manager at First Citizens Bank ( XXXX, NC branch ) managed to facilitate closing this loan with the lien attached that has not been satisfied. XXXX, XXXX and XXXX had knowledge of the lien prior to closing the loan. 

I was told by a loan officer at First Citizens in XXXX, NC that a loan could not be closed with an outstanding lien. So, why have I not been paid? 

I suspect that XXXX XXXX ( homeowner ) has committed the fraudulent, felony act of forging my signature on a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( banker ) has made attempts to conceal it. He has even asked a former co-worker to sign a non-disclosure agreement when she resigned from First Citizens Bank. 

It should be noted, the general contractor also filed a lien and perfected it with a lawsuit which is pending in XXXX County Civil Superior Court. I consulted an attorney about perfecting my lien with a lawsuit, but I could not afford to proceed with civil action. 

Regardless of what has taken place, I just want to be paid for the work that I did for them."
Debt collection,"I sent this company a validation letter and they signed for it on XX/XX/XXXX about an alleged debt they say I owe. What I received in return was a bill/statement. 

They have failed to provide me with a copy of any viable evidence, bearing my signature, showing the account is being reported accurately and that I have a legally binding contractual obligation to pay them the alleged amount, Furthermore The whole entry on my credit file of this account is completely inaccurate along with the dates on the bill/statement they had sent me that supposedly verified this as a valid debt I owe. 

The open date that shows on my credit report, regarding this account shows that it was opened XX/XX/XXXX however on the bill/statement they have sent me it shows date ranges from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX? So 3 years later they want to report this false information? 

The high balance compared to the balance on my credit file for this is showing a high balance of {$210.00} but a balance of {$610.00}? But on the bill/statement they sent is shows {$610.00}? Nothing is accurate about what they are claiming! What is crazy is that the credit bureau ( s ) came back and said it meets FCRA requirements Thats a lie. What proof did they get?! 

I am making a final attempt to have them clear up this matter. The listed item is entirely inaccurate and incomplete, and represents a very serious error in there reporting. 

All documents regarding communication with this company including return receipts and what I received from them along with the entry of this account on my credit report have been attached."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had two credit cards with Capitol One with large credit limits for more than 14 years and have never missed a payment. I added Authorized users to my account, they requested I provide them with copies of the persons drivers license and Social Security cards via a secure link they provided. The other day I had finally got the last copy of the Social Security card and uploaded to the link they provided. A day or so later, I tried to purchase electronics for my business and it was denied. I called Capitol One and was told they had closed out both my credit cards and my reward points were forfeited. I called them again today and was told there is nothing they can do to reinstate the cards or refund my reward points. The reason they are giving me for closing the accounts is that they can't verify the documents I provided. I provided copies of front and back of the drivers licenses and Social Security cards as they requested. Is there anything I can do to get these cards reinstated, refund of my rewards points, and have them correct my credit report?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a credit card that I rarely used at the time, but now no longer use at all. It had a XXXX  balance last time I checked it. There was a fraudulent charge from XXXX on XX/XX/2018 for {$110.00}. On XX/XX/18 I realized that my credit score on XXXX XXXX had been impacted, so I looked into the situation. I noticed the fraudulent charge and then promptly disputed the transaction with XXXX XXXX. They refunded the amount and the late fees on XX/XX/2018 and considered the dispute closed. I reached out to them again to let them know that the reported late fees were still affecting my credit reporting. I reached out to Experian, XXXX and XXXX to report the issue and raised a dispute with all three bureaus. One bureau has the late payment still under dispute and the other two have reported it as resolved with no error found. My credit score dropped from around 795 to around 650 on the other two reporting agencies. Disputing a reported item will cause it to be excluded from a score, so my other score is still around 795. This is now a huge problem because my husband and I are trying to buy a house and his score is around 800. The lenders are giving us rates 0.375-0.5 % higher just because of this unresolved issue on my credit report. I am now not sure which way to go about this now. Wells Fargo has been no help."
Checking or savings account,"Chase closed my account due to me asking for an accommodation under the XXXX for my XXXX. Chase felt I was not patience enough to accommodate my XXXX and closed the account. 
When they closed they account, I requested that they never contact me again because it would remind me of the discrimination and that I am XXXX and can not expect equal access to good and services from companies that do not accommodate the XXXX. Despite my requests Chase continues to email me asking me to sign into my secure message center. Each time it makes me feel horrible and reminds me of the day they threw me out of the bank keeping my ID and a check, I feel bad because of this and just want peace."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I had a XXXX  XXXX XXXX credit card on which I had a first late payment in XX/XX/XXXX. The account was closed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and referred to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. While I eventually paid the full balance due, the closed account was continuously late from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. This account continues to show up on all three credit bureau reports. Because the date of first default is more than seven years  ago and the account was in collections, the entire account should by now be removed from my credit report. 

I filed a dispute with TransUnion and received notification that XXXX  XXXX XXXX had confirmed the account as accurate and is reporting it as late from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. It does not show the earlier late payments. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX 's Credit Card Department. The employee informed me that he also saw that the account should be removed from my credit report but transferred me to the Collections Department for further assistance. The Collections Department Employee told me that they do not keep records going back that far and was unable to locate my old account for further assistance."

Debt collection,I called IQ Data on XX/XX/19 and spoke with XXXX and he assured me that once payment was made collection will be removed and email confirmation will be sent over confirming that debt was taken care of and removed from my credit report file. We are now on day 11 and I've been hung up on and transferred trying to retrieve/check the status of the email confirmation.
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",purchased bitcoin and erthrum coin from coinbase worth XXXX dollars to try it out and the money was frozen and they transfer from a simple debt card took days to transfer and the activity was paralysed and i lost the big gain the currency offered at the time of purchase and yet still they can not let you take your money out for next 18 days this i find really crazy and horrible plus the customer service do not respond nor answer their phone. the automated system is horrible and useless.
Credit card or prepaid card,I initiated a call to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX to complain about the excessive interest ( XXXX % ) that has been charged since inception. The bank called and left message for me on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with a manager at bank and was told nothing could be done regarding the interest rate. The average rate currently charged by credit card companies is XXXX % ; Barclay 's rate is XXXX % or XXXX % points higher than average rate. Barclay 's lending is predatory - they have extremely high interest rates coupled with extremely high credit limits. Virtually all cards now offer rewards so the fact that this is a reward card does not justify such a high interest rate. My current balance is {$34000.00} and most recent monthly interest charge was {$720.00}. The credit limit is {$42000.00}. I have been a cardholder since XXXX. The bank made absolutely no effort to address my issue other than allow me to talk to a manager.  They did not want to know specifics about my issues other than to tell me that the Bank isn't currently lowering rates.
Debt collection,"I received a call from this business this evening from a Georgia number. I am assuming that this number is spoofed since they asked me to callback a completely different number. I was at work so I did not immediately answer. I later received a call from my mother who explained to me that they left a voicemail with an account number while informing her that this was a debt collection call. They left the same exact recording that I received which included an account number and the fact that this was a debt collection call. 
I called the phone number on the voicemail and spoke to a representative that was very rude and unapologetic. She said that she has just received my account but when I asked why they had called my mother they said that they had been trying to call me for a year. My complaint is that they not only are using harassing methods of contact, they are not giving me any opportunity to call back without first calling my family. As the operator said, they "" just got my account '' so there was no reason to contact other phone numbers. Additionally, they are illegally leaving account information on my family 's voicemails. The company also threatened that the will no longer use "" voluntary '' means of communication. I am not sure what that means but it is also illegal. Finally, when I advised that they no longer had permission to contact my family, the representative ( Mrs. XXXX ) advised that they have every right to continue contact with my family. Since they have already reached me, this is incorrect and illegal. Since the debt collector continued to talk over me I disconnected the phone call. 

I am attaching the voicemail that was left on my and my mother 's voicemail."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2019 I deposited a check into my chase bank acct via atm, in the ammount of XXXX and it printed out my receipt saying funds would be available by XX/XX/XXXX. The check was cleared by the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and on the morning of the XXXX I checked my banking app to see if the money was in my acct, it was. But when I went to use my debt card to pay bills n make purchases my card was declined, I called cutover service and was today that my acct had become restricted due to the the check not being verified and that my acct would be closed by the XXXX of XXXX if the check was not verified. I was told that I had 10 days from the date the check cleared, which was the XXXX to have the check verified. I was never contacted in any way to have been aware of any of this and was not given enough time to figure out what was meant to be done and to stop my acct from being closed. Long story short my acct was closed and I was sent a check on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of XXXX, the remaining balance in my checking acct not including the XXXX check that was deposited in my acct, I was told that in order for them to release the check amount to me I would have to go into a branch bank with the executor of the check and both bring in documents verifying that we are who we are. The executor of the check was out of state at the time and wouldnt be back til the end of XXXX and I was told that the money will be held until we come into the bank to be verified. So Ive been waiting over a month for this money, had my bank acct closed and have had no help in getting my money back. Why would chase bank clear the check on the XXXX and still ask for it to be verified in order for me to get my money?"
Checking or savings account,"I was promised by Ally Financial bank a 1 % cash back bonus if I opened up a new account or deposit money to an existing account. I did so by depositing XXXX into a new account ending ... XXXX on XXXX ( before the dated line of XXXX ). I also received a confirmation email of that on XXXX confirming my enrollment before the date line of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I followed all the requirement of outlined on the email of XXXX and yet I did not receive the {$1000.00} cash back bonus by XX/XX/XXXX as promised on that email. I have called them several times on this issues, despite the fact that they confirm my qualifications for the cash back bonus, yet they say it would take 7-10 business day to do research on the reason why you have not been paid. Exh. 2 is a chat print of an ally agent with me on XX/XX/XXXX in which it is stated that I have been qualified for the cash back bonus and that it would take 7-10 business day to get the money. 
However, this sounds to me fishy as to why it should take 7-10 business day to deposit the money into my account while it was supposed to be done by XX/XX/XXXX. 
I ask them to pay the bonus and then do your research about your software problem. 
They are not listening and bushing me around."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Bank of America sent me a past due notice today XX/XX/19. The full amount due was {$1400.00}. I immediately made a payment of {$1200.00}. I had the funds, just forgot to make the payment.I then wanted the {$25.00}. late fee reversed. In the past due notice was a message that said, "" We're here to help, we appreciate the opportunity to serve your financial needs. Please call us at XXXX '', which I then did. I received a recorded message that said, '' We appreciate your business '' and then menu choices. At XXXX XXXX   they gave me a call back from the Virginia Office of BofA. I explained why i didn't make the payment, told them I had just made almost the entire payment, and would they please reverse the $ XXXX.fee. First person said no, I was not eligible to have the fee reversed, I asked why, she said, We don't need to give you a reason, you just aren't eligible. '' I asked to be connected to her supervisor, she connected me to her supervisor named XXXX from Virginia office, she said "" it doesn't matter how long you have been a customer with us, and that you wiped out almost the entire balance, you are not eligible for a fee reversal, because you have not lived up to the terms of the agreement you made with BofA to make a timely payment '' ( paraphrase here ) I asked to be connected with the supervisors supervisor who word for word echoed the same statement as # 2 supervisor. All from the Virginia office of BofA. No regard for the fact that I have been a long-standing BofA customer, am XXXX years old, and on a fixed income. {$25.00}. means alot to me."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I received an email on XX/XX/XXXX from American Express telling me the company had reduced my credit limit from {$1400.00} to {$800.00}. I had just paid down the balance on the card by {$1000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$500.00} ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( {$500.00} ) with a plan to pay the balance down to {$0.00} in XXXX. I had unexpected medical expenses and home repairs at the end of XXXX that drove my balance up. However, I never missed a payment and never went over my credit limit. 

I contacted Amex customer service and they said the decision was triggered by their system and my account was under review by a team. I requested the credit limit not be reduced because they are hurting my credit standing overall by making this decision immediately after I paid down the balance. The customer service agent assured me that Amex cares which is the furthest thing from the truth.

I believe the way that Amex is managing their accounts is predatory in nature. I would like to see their practices of reducing credit lines audited. It appears they are trying to hurt customers who have done nothing but use their credit line and paid it down in a timely fashion."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I called Experian today XX/XX/XXXX because I received an email stating there was an update to my file. I explained to the Representative that a tradeline had been inaccurately deleted from my by them per the representative I spoke with 3 weeks ago. The first Representative today told me my creditor had the account deleted on XX/XX/XXXX after I stated that is false information because I spoke with the creditor who stated they received a Block notification from Experian on XX/XX/XXXX. The Representative then stated it was deleted due to the address the creditor was reporting that was reported as a fraudulent address which again was incorrect because I verified the address my creditor was and is reporting. The representative then stated my creditor is reporting the trade line but they are reporting it with an old address, I then asked why is it not showing on my credit report if it is reporting, he then stated my creditor needed to call and speak to their Experian Rep at XXXX. I asked to speak to a Supervisor or Manager and was put on hold for 50 min until I stated I could hear all the representatives in the background and his call time was increasing, so it would look better if he just hung up on me and he did. When I called back and got the next representative she again stated my creditor was having my credit blocked and I explained to her I spoke to the creditor again on XX/XX/XXXX who told me they sent the proof via email to them that they sent the block notification and the sent the reinsertion form to have the trade line put back on. I asked to speak to a supervisor or manager and was told they will tell you the same thing to send a reinsertion form. I asked again to speak to the manager or supervisor and was told to hold I would be transferred to him and I was sent to the voice mail of XXXX XXXX because he did not answer the phone. I sent my letter stating the accounts were not fraud as I was instructed by the first representative 3 weeks ago and the creditor has sent a reinsertion form with proof of their mistake to them."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had a XXXX XXXX card which I always paid on time. In XXXX I deployed to XXXX and asked for my payments to be deferred which was done at a later date by AAFES. However, they still reported negative information on my account. In XXXX while stationed in XXXX my AAFES card was fraudulently used to purchase a computer notebook. I did not make the purchase and didn't know that a purchase had been made on my charge card until after negative information started appearing on my credit report. AAFES confirmed that the purchase was made but failed to send me the dispute documents. They said the purchase was made online and shipped stateside even though I was still in XXXX. I made some payments and then felt that I should have to pay for something I didn't purchase. AAFES then took the remaining balance from my Tax Refund. I did not want to continue to argue with AAFES so I called and asked if the account was paid in full and they confirmed the account showed a XXXX balance in XXXX. In XXXX negative information started showing on my credit report. The negative information showed {$1.00} was owed and placed for collections. 

In XXXX AAFES also agreed to remove all negative information from my credit report due to several situations arising while servicing the account.

Student loan,"I have one open student loan with Navient. I send a payment every week to Navient with the loan number listed in the memo of the check. They apply the payment to 6 other loans that have been closed and sent to collections to be handled by a different company despite the fact that the loan number is listed on the check. I have not made a payment on the closed loans since XXXX but in my credit report it shows that I am paying monthly on them. I am not paying Navient at all for these loans. I have talked to them four times to have them correct this and apply the payments correctly and they will not. I have previously filed with the CFPB and they corrected it momentarily and then went back and did the exact same thing. I want all payments ever sent to Navient to be only applied to the open loan, and it corrected on my credit report for both the open and the closed loans. The last payment made to any closed loans was in XXXX and was sent to XXXX   XXXX, not Navient,"
Debt collection,"I had an old medical debt from XXXX that was resolved with the provider. Capio partners apparently purchased the debt in XXXX of XXXX and immediately put it on my credit report ... not only once, but they duplicated the collection two other times using various names of their same company.They put very similar amounts owed ( must have been willing to take a bit less on one to make it look like two different accounts ) and then you their are two separate names of the collection agencies however they are on EXACTLY the same parkway, "" XXXX XXXX '' in XXXX Texas with slightly different suite numbers! They are doing this because I told their collection person who called me that I was in the middle of a mortgate ( mistake # 1 ) and then they IMMEDIATELY generated THREE separate bogus accounts on my credit for the most impact to my score!! When asked to verify, I still have not heard a response and for some reason the credit bureaus have said that the dispute was not supported so the information remains!! How does that happen?? They are literally creating double and triple jeaporady and they are the SAME COMPANY!! Capio Partners and XXXX XXXX   FIRM ... BOGUS and ILLEGAL! Not only that, the original debt was listed as a charged off account with XXXX and I paid it to them! Even if Capio purchased a debt from someone else, it was a charge off and should NOT be reported as an OPEN ACCOUNT on their records, further harming my credit!"

Mortgage,I reported my complaint to you back in XXXX and XXXX of this year about ditech not giving me my payoff for my mortgage loan .They responded to it with nothing but lies .the dates they gave you were phone calls from me to them about the same problem. I received two separate letters from Ditech stating they were checking into my problem and it would be thirty days befor they would respond. Well its now XX/XX/XXXX and still nothing from them .All I know is their filing for another chapter XXXX but will not return my request for my payoff.If I try and call I am put on hold for over an hour and half.
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX I tried to make a payment on my mortgage. My mortgage was previously serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. Carrington Mortgage services is now the servicer. The terms in which my payments are processed have changed dramatically. I have to pay fees to make payments which I did not have to do before, my payments have gone up again which did not happen before, and then if I fall behind which in my almost 10 years of paying on my mortgage has happened, life happens. When I try to make my payments Carrington shuts down avenues to make them. If I am in the 30 day late category they refuse online payments and refuse over the phone payments. I spoke at length with two representatives from Carrington Mortgage Services on XX/XX/XXXX. I was advised that they will take my payment from through XXXX XXXX at an additional {$8.00} charge because they were refusing my online payment and would apply it by the end of business. I made XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX XXXX I paid more than enough to cover the late fees. That brings me less than 30 days past due. I was assured they would apply the payment and that they process payments on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX as well. Either way my payment was made before 3pm that Friday. I checked my Carrington online account and it is still not posted. This is not the first time Carrington had refused payments. I was only 1 month behind and I pay my penalty. You have people who serve their time in prison for crimes. I had an issue that arose and paid my late fee. For them to continue to penalize me and refuse my payments or not apply my payments which is the case here I feel is unacceptable. As of writing this I am officially less than 30 days past due and should be cleared on any default on my loan. I am fine with a new servicer on my loan, however I am quite offended and frustrated that I feel Carrington is not servicing my loan in the same manner it was being serviced for the almost 10 years I have had my loan. I have not signed any paperwork or agreed to any additional fees and I feel they are playing deceptive games by refusing to apply payments to try to send my loan to foreclosure. My servicer should be the one per my understanding of the law to try to help with foreclosure avoidance and refusing to apply full monthly payments, especially when such payment brings my loan back into the less than 30 days past due status I feel is fraudulent activity and I am requesting they cease and desist these perceived fraudulent activities immediately and apply any and all payments to my account and fix any damages to my credit report. I am also requesting that they go back and fix my credit for the last time they held almost 3 months of my payments in a suspense account and refused to release the payments and during that time reported negatively on my credit report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX after I received a call from a company called XXXX claiming to represent XXXX. I spoke to the XXXX representative inquiring about account status and was advised that I was 60 days delinquent as of that day XX/XX/XXXX. I was confused because the last payment made covered 2 months. I asked has this information reported delinquent to the credit bureaus and the XXXX representative advised they do not report 30 days and report the first delinquency at 60 days and since today is the 60th day if payment were received XXXX would not report the late payment. I said, are you sure? He stated yes, and I then provided my information to bring the account current. Before ending the call I asked if he could provide something in writing the account would not report and he said no, but I work for XXXX and this will not report as past due. On XX/XX/XXXX I received updates from all bureaus that XXXX reported 30 days delinquent. I now see this as a deceptive inhouse collections practice used to collect a payment and probably a cash incentive. This type of practice is not allowed per FDCPA and based on his conversation with me I request the delinquencies be removed from all bureaus. I spoke to XXXX a manager in the XXXX XXXX office that says she is sending a request to corporate to remove the late reports, however she has no last name and did not sound confident in her communication. I would like to ensure the call is pulled and listened to and XXXX honors what their representative advised me on XX/XX/XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There was a settlement for this credit card account. This account has been paid and it is closed now. Please remove from the all 3 credit reports immediately.
Mortgage,"I had originally filed a complaint about TD Bank with the CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX. That complaint ID number is XXXX. To summarize, I included an additional principal payment with my normal mortgage payment, and it was mishandled. The entire payment was put into unapplied funds instead of being applied properly. TD Bank fixed the payment after the complaint was filed. 
TD Bank has performed the same actions every month since then with my extra payment. Every month I put in an extra principal amount. I fill out their payment coupon properly, clearly stating in the line marked extra principal the extra amount. Every month, the payment is put into unapplied funds until I call or possibly a week later. During these times, my online account has always stated I owe {$0.00} on the first of the month. I wrote a follow up to my original complaint, but it was unanswered. 
This last month, XXXX, I made yet another mortgage payment with an additional principal. The payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX. As normal, the payment showed up as unapplied funds. I waited a few days, and this time, the payment was changed improperly. Online, it showed my unapplied funds going totally to my extra principal instead of a normal mortgage payment with additional principal. My online account also was updated since the first of the month stating that I owe my normal mortgage amount, due this past XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called TD Bank on XX/XX/XXXX concerning this. I was told my issue had been forwarded to a higher department to fix. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, the funds have still not been applied properly. My mortgage was due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since these funds were not properly serviced by TD Bank, I am now late with my mortgage payment. 
It is quite obvious TD Bank is in direct violation of the UDAAP ( unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices ). TD Bank repeatedly mishandles my mortgage payments. A quick view of my payment history shows how every month I have dealt with the same issue. Having my online mortgage statement say I owe XXXX $ is deceptive. Adding this extra burden for me to repeatedly and constantly follow up every mortgage payment with phone calls and non-stop monitoring is unfair. TD Banks response to my previous complaint included a phone number for me to call if issues re-appeared. That phone number is incorrect. Again, more blatant abuse from TD Bank. There is no way I can avoid these abusive acts by TD Bank. 
Please review my previous complaint & unanswered follow up to that complaint, attached below. I believe any hint of a late payment should be expunged from all records, credit reports, or other history and TD Bank should be heavily fined for these continued unfair practices. 

ORIGINAL COMPLAINT : On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to pay my mortgage at a TD Bank Branch. The mortgage payment coupon/slip clearly states "" Mortgage Payment ''. It also has a part for you to add additional principle or additional escrow and to total. I added an additional XXXX towards my principle. The transaction took quite a while and included XXXX members of the staff including the manager. I heard them clearly state to put the amount of XXXX in the extra principle field. I received a simple receipt stating I made a "" LOAN PYMT '' in the total of my normal payment plus the XXXX extra principle. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account had not been properly credited. The online account showed there was a Misc Receipt made on XX/XX/XXXX, and the outstanding balance of my mortgage had not reflected ANY payment since the prior month. I went back to the branch that day and spoke with the manager, XXXX XXXX. She was one of the employees present when I attempted my payment. While with her, she contacted her account support by phone. They said my payment was used as a pre-payment for future mortgage payments, NOT as a normal mortgage payment with an extra principle deposit. Ms. XXXX explained how the local branch put applied the payment accordingly and was told something went wrong. She was reassured the issue would be corrected that evening and the change would show the next day. This change would also reflect the payment was made on the XXXX XXXX. Ms. XXXX suggested in the future I write two checks and make separate payments to my mortgage if I want to pre-pay my principle. This is a bit odd as the mortgage coupon/slip and the banks system has a spot for me to make an extra principle deposit. I was also told by Ms. XXXX that she would follow up with my payment and contact me the next day to ensure it was done properly. I have not received any contact from TD Bank as of yet. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, my account has NOT been updated. This costs me the daily interest accruing on the mortgage. It is very wrong for a bank to treat its customers this way. I do not blame the branch employees, as they did what they could have to make the proper payment. Requiring me to write separate checks to make extra principle payments should not happen. 

ORIGINAL FOLLOW UP : Prior to receiving TD Banks response to my compliant, I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX on this issue. My account was properly adjusted as stated. I was told if I have any other questions to contact her directly via the number on the reply I would ( and did XXXX receive. I believed everything would be fine and this complaint could be put to rest. In XXXX, I made a payment to my loan for the normal amount plus XXXX extra principle. The check cleared my bank on XX/XX/XXXX. My online account once again had the payment entered as a Misc receipt. I tried to contact XXXX XXXX via the number given to me on TD Banks reply to this complaint, XXXX. That number does not reach XXXX, but a voicemail for XXXX XXXX I left messages with no reply. There was no indication XXXX XXXX has any affiliation with TD Bank. I later looked at my cellphones history and tried the number I was contacted from after the first complaint. I left a message with my name. I did not receive a return call, but the next day, the funds were properly allocated. The next paper statement mailed statement states unapplied funds were added on XX/XX/XXXX. It continues to state on XX/XX/XXXX the proper amounts were taken from the unapplied funds. Online, the account shows all transactions happening on XX/XX/XXXX. In XXXX, I made the payment for the normal amount plus XXXX extra principle. The check cleared on XX/XX/XXXX. I tried calling the number from TD Banks response again to no avail, it was still for XXXX XXXX and she never returned my calls. I have since lost the other number which may or may not be related. It was not until this morning, XX/XX/XXXX, in which my account has been properly updated. Maybe it was because I called to inquire about the payoff amount the night before. There is no reason in todays technological environment that this should occur. In my conversation with XXXX prior to the TD Bank response to the complaint, I inquired on how I can help TD Bank properly process my payment. I was told there was nothing more I could do as filling out the coupon properly does this. Looking back at my mortgages history, I see that back between XXXX & XXXX I regularly made payments with extra principle. They were consistently deposited properly. Both my online account history and paper statements prove this. Why has TD Bank chosen to make this a challenge now. My online account has misleadingly said the amount due was XXXX since this issue was supposedly resolved back in XXXX. Even though the proper amounts were finally distributed today, my account still states I owe XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I will receive my statement in the mail with an amount due soon, as I have in the past. It will state I own my normal payment, as expected. Why does the website try to deceive me? It seems like TD Bank has a pattern of improperly applying my mortgage payments as instructed. It is unfair that I can not seem to avoid this extra effort to ensure this account is serviced properly and in a timely manner. I was more than willing and tried repeatedly to contact XXXX instead of continuing this complaint. Unfortunately, that too was fruitless. In searching online, I have noticed I am not alone. Others have also had their additional principle put into unapplied funds. ( see https : //www.consumeraffairs.com/finance/td_ameritrade.html for one example ) This pattern of unfair and deceptive practices should be stopped."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I was trying to buy concert tickets and the person on XXXX said to send money through XXXX. I said, "" how do i know if i send you money you'll send me the tickets '' and they said "" its a secure transfer through your bank ''. They gave me a phone number and a name to find on XXXX, I transferred the money ( XXXX ) and waited for the tickets. They never sent them and disappeared. I immediately called Wells Fargo and they opened a claim. Right after that I called non-emergency police and filed a claim as well as said to press charges if they find the criminal. I gave them the XXXX XXXX ID number, and all other information I had. Wells Fargo closed the claim and said I can resubmit with any new information, I tried again and it was closed again saying it was not fraudulent, and taking not helping with XXXX at all. I called to find out information, and all they said was they can not "" go into someone else 's account and retract funds '' even with a police report. I issued a complaint on the phone then with Wells Fargo, and they said they'd mail me any updates. XXXX has no fraud department, and hangs up on you when trying to connect. I don't know what else to do at this point.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The original debt was charged off in XXXX, and is not even on any of my credit reports. How can a charged off debt over 10 years old be purchased? It was not purchased and this collection post is a complete fraud perpetuated against XXXX, and an abuse of my rights under FCRA and FDCPA. The attached post on my credit bureau claims that a debt was purchased by a third party. At no time from my initial dispute was a debt validated. Under Federal Trade Commission guidelines, a debt must be proved, showing actual hard copy transfer. That does not mean a letter of transfer, but an actual transfer with signature backup. The debt purchase industry is the largest scam ongoing against the American consumer. Both the collection agency/debt purchaser are in violation of their subscriber agreement with every credit reporting agency. At no time was the debt validated, and the initial timeline from the original creditor has been cut off, and thus the debt is illegally being re-aged to benefit both the original creditor and the illegal debt collection process. Both the original trade line must be removed along with the invalid collection process. This problem will continue to exist since the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Supreme Court decision of XX/XX/XXXX, whereas the third party purchase voids the individuals rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Since there is no proof of true hard copy transfer and ownership, the collection is VOID and the collection process must cease and my file for both accounts must purge. These items must be deleted permanently and my files need to be purged. My information was obtained through a debt pooling process that should be terminated by the Federal Trade Commission. XXXX XXXX has committed a fraudulent act by even posting my antiquated information and there should be sanctions taken against this company. Now XXXX XXXX is extending the fraudulent activity to a fourth party collection service called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. There is absolutely no connection to a valid debt, and my name must be deleted immediately from all corresponding files. All credit bureaus are being aware of this problem as now two debt collection agencies/debt buyers are in violation of their subscriber agreement across the board with the major credit bureaus. The credit reporting as well as the debt collection is 100 % fraudulent and needs to cease immediately and permanently."

Checking or savings account,"I had an incorrect ACH withdrawal made from XXXX on my PNC checking account. 

I spoke with XXXX and they gave me my options for addressing the situation. 
There were several, but the fastest one involved my contacting my financial institution ( PNC ) to resolve the problem through the Automatic Clearing House  procedures. 
They told me to specificall ask to "" unauthorize the charge ''. Then they placed a forbearance to allow time to resolve the incorrect charges.This call took approximately 25 minutes. 

Next I called PNC to take care of this. I started with customer service and explained my request. First she stated that this was completely impossible, and that only the charger could unauthorize. That they could do so, but I would need to have them on the line. After that, I asked for the department to call directly so I could have XXXX do that. Approximate call time 30 minutes. 

I called XXXX, and I waited again on the line for XXXX. I spoke with a supervisor regarding the banks request. XXXX said they had heard many things from banks but this was a new one. THey passed me up to a supervisor.The XXXX supervisor told me that Federal ACH regulations allow consumers to unauthorize an incorrect charge within 60 days of charge being made, and that I should call back my institution XXXX time about 15 minutes. 

I called back PNC. I explained what I was trying to accomplish. THe agent said she spoke to her supervisor and the ACH department. They explained I could put a "" stop funds '' request, but that since it was not 3 days prior to the charge that it would most likely not work. They said then after 2 business days I could request a refund and dispute the charge. I mentioned the regulations and asked her to speak again to her supervisors and they again said that whoever I spoke to did not know anything about banks and who was XXXX anyway! 

After another call to the supervisor at XXXX, where the supervisor gave me the error code and affirmed their ability to unauthorize and ach I tried one more time to PNC with no result. 

So I have now spent four hours on the phone today. 
I would like to report PNC for failing to follow Nathional ACH regulations ( at least as I understand them. ) The people I spoke to at PNC were, XXXX XXXX, XXXX?, with supervisor of XXXX XXXX, and a XXXX who they said worked with ACH transactions.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a chase XXXX rewards premier plus card via XXXX ( where the offer was initially made ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  and than I was redirected to chase on the XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Application was processed and approved as per online application. I was than stated that I was going to received the card in about 7 business days. I now today XX/XX/XXXX access my account and noticed an annual fee was applied for {$95.00} when the offer I applied for was for a {$0.00} intro annual fee for the first year, then {$95.00} after the first year has passed and a {$200.00} credit after first purchase within 3 months from account opening. I contacted chase today to verify what is going on and the first agent mentioned the offer is not valid online via chase at it seemed the site may have not  updated it on their end and therefore being an old offer and the other answer was that they don't know what happened and that I was redirected to another site that wasn't offering the promotion. As a XXXX myself and working as well in XXXX  this is an unacceptable answer. I spoke to the supervisor XXXX and I mentioned to her my credit was ran therefore affecting me as an individual because it was ran for a useless purpose. She stated there is nothing she can do and can not give the {$200.00} credit offer nor reverse the {$95.00} fee. It is upsetting that such a huge company could care less for their consumers and needless to say have consideration and accept the responsibility of their incompetent system if that is the case. I take this personal as I am a person with a good withstanding credit and I would have not applied if it wasn't because of the offer was there. To me this is false advertisement and misleading as once again I applied mainly to take advantage of the offer being made otherwise I would have not applied. As a consumer is only shows me that I can't trust companies and it's insulting as a consumers because they are very dismissive without a care to the individual."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","My son purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX without a title. We went to DMV for advice/info.  They researched history and found a bank that was the last know lienholder of his dirtbike. XXXX XXXX XXXX. It turns out that this bank has been boughy out by Capital One. DMV asked that Capital One indicates in writing ( notarized ) that they either release the title or indicate they have no interest in the title. Capital One did this. However, DMV was not satisfied with the notarized statement of non interest from Capital One. DMV needs Capital One to release a disclosure of the bank and or banks they have bought out that may or may not be affiliated with XXXX XXXX XXXX or specifically thereof. I have contacted Capital One via phone and fax on nemerous occassions. Have been told that response time may take up to 30 days. I have paid DMV all fees and and I just want to get a title created for my sons XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to be legal."
Mortgage,"I have been attempting to remove PMI from my mortgage for about 18 months. The mortgage servicer, Huntington Mortgage Group, will not consider the original appraisal of my property ( {$120000.00} ) but  only the refinance value of XXXX 
The original mortgage was closed on XX/XX/XXXX and this loan was refinanced on XX/XX/XXXX, through the HARP program, which did not require a new appraisal. 
I currently owe {$96000.00}, significantly less than 80 %, nevertheless the Company is requiring a current appraisal, at my expense, with a cost of {$380.00} by their referred appraiser and no guarantee of it being a fair and valid one. I am unable to afford this. 
According to XXXX XXXX XXXX the current value of my property is {$130000.00}, according to XXXX it is {$150000.00}. 
It does seem odd and quite unfair that, for taking advantage of a federal government program ( HARP ), I am being penalized, since, if I had nor refinanced there would be no issue on the cancellation of PMI based on the original purchase price, with no need of an updated appraisal."

Well its now XXXX and i havent heard anything about my Identity theft file claim. Its been way over 30 days and i havent had any update or anythjing to my account. I was told it takes up to 48 hours for my file to Block the Stolen Info thats on my report. But XXXX and Transunion wont Block and complete my theft report claim. Its been over 60 days and I havent got any responses. Can you have them to please Block the account so i can get thru this horrible Identity theft.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I check my credit weekly and today XX/XX/19 I noticed that my credit score for  all three Credit Reporting Agencies had DROPPED approx. 50 POINTS  from the previous week.

Additionally, I have never been late on anything ... 

I called XXXX  and Experian and in both cases the customer service representative was NOT ABLE to make any sense of the issue. 

The gross and incorrect misrepresentation of my credit is a detriment to me in many ways. My occupation, My credit and other things as well. 

The bottom line is ; The credit reporting agencies are not accountable to anyone. Individuals harmed by these agencies can rarely recover anything, and there is nothing that can be done to correct information regardless of weather it is correct, incorrect, inaccurate unless they want to..

RE : Account # # XXXX ( All accounts fall under this umbrella ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Student loan,"I submitted my Income-Based Repayment plan application on XX/XX/XXXX ( my deadline was XX/XX/XXXX ). On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email that my application couldn't be processed and that I would receive a letter detailing why. I was told I was in a pending status. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a vague letter in my XXXX XXXX inbox that either my current income couldn't be determined or the income documentation was more than 90 days old and that I should submit new documentation "" within the next couple of days. '' Nowhere was it mentioned that my interest could capitalize. I realized that the documentation I had submitted was from XX/XX/XXXX ( so 10 days off from my submission date ) and submitted a new pay stub on XX/XX/XXXX ( in the "" next couple of days '' as requested by XXXX ). I then randomly logged in to my account on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed that my interest had been capitalized on XX/XX/XXXX! I also noticed on XX/XX/XXXX that there was a letter in my inbox ( which I had NOT been notified of by email and would not have seen otherwise ) stating that "" Since we did not receive your complete annual documentation, your new payment amount is not based on your income, '' even though I had submitted the correct documentation on XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( since XX/XX/XXXX was a weekend ) and a request was placed to look into this. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to check on status and was told that it may take 7-10 business days. They were able to finally process by IDR Request at that time. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status and was told they were very busy and it may take up to 20 business days. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the review of my case was completed on XX/XX/XXXX and they had denied my appeal to "" de-capitalize '' my interest because I missed the deadline. Throughout the whole process I talked to multiple XXXX   reps. Each person had a different answer for me. Some employees told me that interest can never be "" de-capitalized, '' while others said that was not true. Several employees told me that it doesn't matter that the interested was capitalized since I was in PSLF and it wouldn't matter in the end ( I don't plan to use it ). While my initial income verification form was off by 10 days, this would have been easily fixable if XXXX would have processed my application in a timely manner ( before the XXXX deadline ). I submitted my new paperwork in a timely manner. I also find it egregious that the letter telling me my interest was capitalized stated that I hadn't completed my paperwork ( even though I had ) and it was NOT sent to my email inbox until XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally, besides employees giving me completely different information literally every time I call XXXX, they never provide any written confirmation of our conversations or a case number, so they rely on their completely inaccurate internal information ( i.e. gentleman on XX/XX/XXXX saying my review has closed on XXXX, when the person I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX told me case was still open for review )."
Mortgage,"It is my understanding that during the process of working with your mortgage company to find an equitable solution to making monthly payments, my account should be on "" inactive status '' and/or do not report missed payments. XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX the mortgage company XXXX reported missed payments. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I was working with the mortgage company to find and equitable solution to assist in making my monthly payments. I was initially approved for forbearance program until they deemed me ineligible. I attempted several times to have my loan refinanced and/or modified but was unsuccessful. I was placed in foreclosure proceedings and attempted to have a HUD approved nonprofit organization ( The XXXX XXXX ) find solutions to keep me from foreclosure. During the foreclosure mediation, the mortgage company 's attorney, XXXX XXXX representative and I reached an agreement to have the outstanding balance paid by a HUD approved program. This never occurred because of non communication between mortgage company attorney and HUD XXXX XXXX. Because of this lack of communication, the mortgage continued to go unpaid and accrue more late fees and attorneys fees. I was eventually approved for a loan modification in XXXX of XXXX, the total ( {$26000.00} ) amount of missed principal, interest, late fees and attorneys fees were added to the back end of the mortgage, interest rate increased, terms extended back to 30 years which increased my monthly payment by {$240.00}. 

As a result of this entire experience my credit scores have been severely impacted coupled with the unnecessary stress during major life threatening medical treatments."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I leased a new car through GM Financial about 2 years ago. I planned to make payments by auto pay from my checking account as I always do for repetitious payments. In order to set up auto pay, other companies have always asked me to send them a voided check. GM did not work that way and instead asked me to read to their representative the routing and account numbers from the bottom of my checks. Because I am not knowledgeable about the banking system, I mistakenly read ALL the numbers, INCLUDING THE CHECK NUMBER. The GM rep did not point out any error, I concluded the auto pay setup and the call. I assumed that all was set up and that my payments were being taken from my account monthly. Several months later, I received a late payment notice with late fees and an invoice for several months rental. I called and spoke with another GM rep and gave that person my check numbers again, and the same sequence of events occurred. This scenario continued throughout my entire 2 year lease. None of the reps mentioned that I had read them too many numbers or the fact that the last 4 digits were different each time I read them out ( since they were the check numbers ). The outcome of all of this is that GM sent a poor credit report to  XXXX that lowered my credit score by about 300 points.  I have always taken great pride in my high credit score and complained to GM that their poor report was not warranted because my intent was always to pay on time. The only problem, which should have been caught by the GM reps, was my lack of knowledge of the banking system and their refusal to take a voided check. When I appealed, they responded like robots, saying that, because they did not make an error, they would not withdraw the poor credit rating they had sent out."

They tell me they are with "" In House Processing '', but say that they are not the original debt holder. They have my SSN, DOB and address, and it makes me very uncomfortable that they have this, but yet I do not know who they are or where they are located. 

This morning was the most recent contact ( XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX MT ). When I called them back, they verified who I was, and indicated that they could settle a debt with them from ACE Cash Express. When I asked them for documentation of the debt, they asked to verify my address, the address that they have for me is incorrect. When I asked for their name and business address, they stated that I was harassing them and hung-up on me. I called back to try and get more information and they stated the debt was from XXXX, that it was for {$1800.00}, and that they could settle for 33 %. They indicated that I was going to be served with court documents for a civil proceeding in XXXX County Court. When I asked them for their attorney 's name they were suing me with, they refused and hung-up again. The third time I called them back, they immediately stated that I was harassing them and that they would count me "" served ''. 

The fact that people in an unknown state, business, etc. have my personal information ( SSN / DOB / Employer ), but they will not tell me who they are, where they are is very concerning. The fact that they have repeatedly stopped calling me for months at a time and then pick back up later leads me to believe that they are hoping one day I will have a lapse in judgment out of fear and give them a credit card for payment on a debt that I'm not aware of!

Also, my husband and I filed for bankruptcy in Colorado approximately 5yrs ago and included any an all debt. If I did owe this company money and was aware of an outstanding debt, then I would have included them."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I’m in over my head with this loan. I started with one loan and then was offered an opportunity to take another loan, that tacked on the balance of the first loan to the new loan and gave me a different payment amount and more total payments due. Then I received another loan offer that tacked the previous two loans onto it and gave me an even higher loan payment and extended the number of my loan payments to an even longer period. I got lost with what was actually what, became overwhelmed by the overall costs of these groups of loans, that were condensed in one larger payment, for even more months. And like a house of cards, everything became overwhelming and fell apart. I went into the office in XX/XX/XXXX and made a payment. I also arranged for a payment to be paid by pre-dated check, in XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX  payment that I arranged was taken, along with additional electronic payments (that were not authorized by me)...which in turn threw the account that these payments  were debited from (my checking account) into the negative & fees incurred. Nothing was done to resolve this issue, it was deemed to be my fault because the One Main account was behind anyway, and no adjustments were made to compensate for the damage done to my checking account. I refused to allow them to debit my checking account again, which made this account even further delinquent. At some point, I no longer knew where or how to properly come to terms with One Main & stop trying & stopped responding to their attempts to contact me.Now they are threatening to sue me for payment and attorneys are constantly seeking to represent me. I have no money to give them or any of these attorneys wanting to represent me, due to other financial issues that have come as a result of attempting to fulfill my obligations to them, as well as my other obligations.That’s my dilemma."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have issues with inaccurate reporting before. XXXX is continuing to report the account as delinquent. I have filed a previous report with CFPB due to inaccurate reporting and problems paying the debt. This account is not delinquent, and it has been managed through a debt consolidation program since XX/XX/2017. The account is being paid in full, and it was not delinquent during the onset of the implementation of the debt management. 

Inaccurate reporting on the behalf of XXXX is continuing to further damage my credit score and cause undue stress."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I reached out to the bureaus in regards to a dispute in question in regards to a repo that was on my credit reports, found out somebody had gotten a vehicle in my name and the vehicle im guessing has YET to be recovered, cant get any information in regards to it because I cant verify account information to whoever has the car so they only tell me what they can well I went to the actual dealership and they were able to give me some information to help me, I was able to contact the company and they finally sent me documentation in regards to the vehicle to help me get the car removed."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX was contacted and reports to me as a consumer that my student loans are in closed status as I am still in my 3 year review period from XXXX and XXXX XXXX Discharge. The review period ends on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. But the Credit report given to a potential creditor on a hard pull of my credit still lists my student loans as delinquent and not in the closed status. The Credit dispute procedure was followed by me with XXXX online in previous weeks and months. I rechecked my credit report with a local credit union and the delinquent student loans are still included in the information that the creditor receives but not in the information I see on my XXXX  credit report I am shown by my XXXXn consumer account. This information is used to deny me credit contrary to the laws of the Consumer Fair Credit Act. I disputed the XXXX account in XX/XX/XXXX and I checked the status today on XX/XX/XXXX. The Delinquent account status is not supposed to be there according to my understanding of the XXXX when I received a XXXX discharge of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX!!
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Creditors that should have gone off my report and are still there after 7 years and selling my old reports to other Companies just to keep my scores down.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There is an issues with incorrect information on credit reports, but one or two incorrect information is one thing, but when there is a list of incorrect information on credit reports that can only be attributed to either really incompetent data entering from credit bureaus or the credit organization reporting to the credit bureaus, which in this case I believe is both, there is something to be said. 

I tried to look at my credit reports and there is so many incorrect information on them, and when I tried to request my credit report online, then the credit bureaus would not let me access my reports and even show my information incorrectly, and when I tried to correct some of the information, they would not let me correct it, and when I enter my information correctly into their system, they display incorrect information right after I enter it correctly. I hate to say there is something going on that is very wrong here but it seems to me it is bad enough when the credit card companies are taking advantage of customer, but when the credit bureau who should be protecting the consumers no longer do their job or even goes as far as adding on the mistakes of incorrect records, consumers have little to do and maybe if that is the case, the credit agencies who are incorrect and not doing their job in the first place should not have a job."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I have a auto loan with Ally Bank. My auto payment ( contractually agreed upon at time of leasing in XX/XX/XXXX ) was increased by {$3.00} per month with no reason given by Ally some time in XX/XX/XXXX. I was never informed. Months later, once it accumulated to {$27.00}, I began receiving calls incessantly from Ally and did understand why. I finally spoke to a representative and they explained that my account was delinquent and past due {$27.00} which would be reported to the credit bureau and adversely impact my credit if I did not pay right away. I was furious as I pay {$280.00} automatically on time every month. I asked the Ally representative to simply take the payment over the phone and they told me I could not. I asked them to just take it out of my auto payment ... they told me they could not. I asked them to push balance month to month so that the additional charge would be paid in my lats auto payment. They said they could not do that. They told me to go online and log in and change my auto payment. I have tried SEVERAL times and can not do this online. I finally gave up and made a manual payment online on XX/XX/XXXX in the  amount of {$27.00} in addition to my auto payment. Since I can not log on monthly to pay {$3.00} so that my account is not delinquent, I am collecting a late fee of {$4.00} every month in addition. I am certain I am not the only one they are running this scheme on ... What they are doing this is making it inconvenient for me to pay an arbitrary, nominal increase to my loan which results in a late fee. They are making {$7.00} off of me monthly and I have no control. They are counting on me to not log on every month to pay {$3.00}. I don't know how this practice is legal. I still do not know why my monthly was increased by this amount. I have written emails and I have left messages, I have threatened to sue and no response. Please help me stop this!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian placed a fraud alert two days after I had one removed from XXXX. I did not place a fraud alert with either agency. XXXX removed the alert immediately upon me contacting them to do so. When I called Experian to have it removed I asked why was a fraud alert placed on my report without my authorization. They claim because XXXX  was reporting they would do the same. I explained to them that XXXX already removed the alert and that they should please do the same. That was on XX/XX/XXXX. I mentioned how imperative that they so because I have a closing on my new primary residence on XX/XX/XXXX. The man that took my information said that I answered the security questions incorrectly and that I would have to upload proof of identification. This is after I already proved my identity with ss # DOB, Current address, and previous address and employer and phone #. As you can imagine I became very irate and demanded that this alert be removed from my credit report. I then complied on XX/XX/XXXX with a letter and copy of my driver 's license and uploaded to their website. The information was received by then on that date. I called back today to inquire about and get an update on my status since my lender has informed me that this is the only thing keeping me from getting my clear to close. So explained that to the person who answered my call today and to please remove this fraud alert. I called in today and explained this to them that this was happening and I was hung up on 4X '' s. This is unacceptable and when I finally was able to speak to someone the man I spoke with said that they still did not receive my documents needed to remove the alert. As you can imagine I lost my cool and explained how this could possibly be. I really feel that they are playing games with me and making a mockery of me because I called out a few of there employees on how unprofessional they were. Can you please into this practice by Experian and see if it's on going problem. This could cost me several thousand dollars if I am not able to close on time. Since the seller is leaving the country for 3 weeks on XX/XX/XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have disputed this item with the credit reporting agency and they reported you confirmed the account as valid. I honestly do not believe to ever have any relationship with this collection agency or original creditor. Also there are several inaccuracies with this account the way it's reporting and that's a total violation of FCRA and FDCPA laws and regulations. In a good faith effort to resolve the matter amicably, I must demand proof of this debt, specifically the alleged contract or other instrument bearing my signature, as well as proof of your authority in this matter. Absent such proof, you must correct any erroneous reports of this past debt as mine. I am writing to request that you please provide the following information : 1. Please evidence your authorization under 15 USC 1692 ( e ) and 15 USC 1692 ( f ) in this alleged matter. 2. What is your authorization of law for your collection of information? 3.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There were two account that showed up on my Experian credit report that were opened on XX/XX/2019. I saw them on credit report starting XX/XX/2019. Both of these account are of XXXX XXXX XXXX.  I called Experian to dispute these accounts ( around XXXX XXXX ). The representative told me that I have to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX, and was told that I do not exist in their system. They couldn't find anything under my name and SSN. Thus, I went back to experian and disputed it using their online dispute services on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Experian responded saying that XXXX XXXX XXXX has certified these accounts and they will stay on my credit report. 
I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and was treated rudely by their representative, because she couldn't find any account under my name, while Experian is showing two account that I never opened. 
None of these companies are trying to help me resolve these, as both of them are referring me to each other for dispute these activities. 
One account has balance of {$1500.00} with credit limit of {$14000.00} Second account has balance of {$1900.00} with {$5500.00} credit limit. 
Because of these activities my credit score went down 11 points. 

Also, there is a wrong address showing up on my report, which is reported by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I  tried to dispute that, but Experian is not removing it from my report as well. Other two credit bureaus, ( XXXX and XXXX ) has none of these information on their credit reports."
Checking or savings account,"I closed my Chase checking account online on XX/XX/19 via Chase 's secure messaging system, and requested to have the remaining balance sent to me by check for the amount of approximately, {$2100.00}. I was told the check would be sent out within seven business days. I never received the check and recontacted Chase via their secure message system on XX/XX/2019 to inquire on the status of my check. I was told again it would take seven business days until a check would be sent out to me, which I responded that I had already waited well past seven business days. I was then told the next day that I needed to physically go into a Chase branch to fill out a for for Declaration of Lost, Stolen, or Destroyed Cashier 's Check, and have it notarized. I initially refused because my work schedule does not allow me to easily go to any of Chase 's branches. However, I relented after a few days, due to the stress this situation was causing. After going into the XXXX, Virginia Chase branch on XX/XX/19, I waited for service for about an hour before finally speaking with a representative whose name was XXXX XXXX. XXXX told me I would have to fill out the form, and that I would be able to get a new check that day in the branch. However, after filling out all of the paperwork, I was then told that I could not actually receive a check that day, because I had cancelled the account online, and not in a physical store. This seemed absurd to me since I was physically in a Chase bank, and Chase should be able to cancel their own checks, and write their own checks, or so I thought. Regardless, I left after being told I would have my check overnighted to me most likely by Tuesday ( XX/XX/19 ), and that someone would contact me on Monday ( XX/XX/19) - neither of these things happened. Additionally, I contacted XXXX using the business card she gave me on my trip into the branch on the following Saturday (XX/XX/19 ). Her coworker answered her phone and told me she would be busy all day and would not be able to contact me until Monday. I asked XXXX 's coworked if she could inquire about my check, to which I was told she could not, and that I would have to wait until Monday. At this point, I am very concerned that I will not be receiving my funds, which I have been waiting for for nearly a month since closing my account. I don't know if the incompetency of Chase 's checking/mailing system is something that can be fixed, but I am contemplating getting a lawyer if I do not receive my check by the end of this week. I have spent hours on the phone, writing emails, going into Chase 's branch, etc, all for the purpose of trying to get my money back. This is completely unacceptable and I don't know where else to turn from here."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I was contacted by what I thought was a company in XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) about a job. The were getting into the US market and needed a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I contacted my CC company as well as XXXX. I was assured by both I would be secure. My CC company told me once I saw a credit into my account the payment could not be reversed. I made purchases for this company only after I saw a credit of {$2600.00}, I then sent the purchased product to the company, Florida and New York. I did this two times and 7 days after the 2nd purchase I saw the payment amount of {$2700.00} reversed because there were no funds in the account that originally made the payment. I immediately called my CC company and told them I was being scammed. I was told there was nothing I could do. I then asked if they had received the first payment and was told they had. I asked if I locked my account if there was any way the first payment could be reversed and was told no. I locked my account and requested to discuss this with a superior. There was none available and was told I would receive a call within 1 to 2 business days. That was XX/XX/XXXX and I received a call on XX/XX/XXXX and was told again repeatedly ( 7 people ) there was nothing they could do. The company called them and told them the withdrawals were being taken from a closed account. My CC company then sent them back the money even though I told them I was the one being scammed. All dates are on a document I uploaded. I thought I had done my due diligence. I plan to file a complaint against XXXX  XXXX XXXX also."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I had an alert this morning on their app that my credit score with down by 16 points which they have never given me a one time score of 16 points for paying my accounts or bills on time and why did they decreased my credit score by 16 points? I was expecting an increase score because i paid off my car loan and one of my student loans because am trying to buy a house. Since my credit score went down, i wanted to know what i did wrong that cause a negative impact on my credit score so, i called Experian and spoke with a representative by name XXXX. XXXX told me that there is no information about why the system decreased my credit score but he knows that the system sometimes miss behave. He then asked me to wait for some few days and that the system will put my scores back together. I was shock and didn't know what to say again because if they have a system that plays with my life, my ability to buy a home, then what else can i say! 
I went ahead to ask about my disputes but he had no idea about any disputes and wanted to transfer me to the dispute department for me to make another dispute. 
It has come to me knowledge that Experian is finding ways and means to lower my credit scores so that i will not be able to get any credit approval and that i will be force to pay for accounts that I have no knowledge of. Experian and the creditors have no prove or right documents by law that those closed and collections accounts belongs to me. The closed and collations accounts doesn't belongs to me and they must delete them from my credit report since they have know prove. 
I want CFPB to intervene.

Student loan,"I have faithfully been making payments on time since the day my loans were in repayment. Suddenly today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) when I access my online account to get tax documentation for my accountant I shockingly saw a letter threatening loan defaulting and negative reporting to creditors over an overdue {$5.00} interest payment from XX/XX/XXXX that I WAS NEVER NOTIFIED ABOUT!! I have even called to speak with XXXX about questions I had should I change employers and whether or not I'd still qualify for PSLF if I did between now and XX/XX/XXXX and no one could mention to me about this {$5.00} overdue payment?? What's the point of XXXX having my contact information if they don't call, email or write any letter or warn me in any way of what is going on??!! I'm horrified and want the issue resolved. Since discovering this today, I went ahead and scheduled to pay the monthly balance on monday XX/XX/XXXX since payments aren't accepted on weekends and today is Saturday. On XX/XX/XXXX, I hope this can all be resolved and I do not want anything negatively reported to any creditor and if it has been since XX/XX/XXXX I want it removed and taken back. I plan to file a negative credit dispute with them and will take this to my state attorney general for further support and for XXXX to take accountability of their improper management and neglectfulness on communication."
Debt collection,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a complaint with the CFPB regarding Credit Corp Solutions and their calling me at work after I had asked them not to, and their illegal threaten of legal action. In their response, they agreed to settle for {$1200.00}. Unfortunately, I had to put that money elsewhere, and I was also afraid to give them access to my bank account information due to the fact they had violated rules earlier and I could not trust them to keep their word. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX  XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX stating they represented Credit Corp Solutions in the matter of a debt with XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$2400.00}. On the same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX through their website and requested validation of the debt. 

I did not receive any validation or verification from XXXX XXXX  XXXX, and therefore had no reason to believe they legitimately could collect this debt. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was made aware that a complaint had been filed against me in this matter in my local court, despite the fact that I had requested validation from XXXX XXXX XXXX. Now I am being sued for this debt by a company, Credit Corp Solutions, who I had previously agreed to pay and had made an agreement with because they broke the rules and now their attorney has as well."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have disputed information repeatedly regarding my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX auto loan. They have indicated that they "" researched '' the account and found the reporting to be accurate. This can not be possible as I was forced to wait in their XXXX XXXX XXXX location most of the day while the loan was audited and found to be current. The issue occurred when they added insurance to my account without informing me. I walked into the branch every month and made my payment. Not once did any associate tell me I was behind on my account until I received a one month late notice. I was confused but brought it current. They continued to carry the insurance fee over until my payment was one month late. When I questioned them, they would not give me information. When I finally got to the information I needed, I corrected the insurance issue. They chose to apply the insurance credit to principle and refused to bring my loan current. I went to the primary branch and remained in the lobby until a representative finally put the loan in for audit. The audit revealed that the loan was not behind. That representative told me he would not correct the reporting. I have been disputing it since then. If the audit revealed the loan to be current. The reporting should have been corrected also. There is no logic to support that an incorrect loan that required auditing and correction was reported accurately as it was."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I wrote each bureau regarding accounts that are currently reporting to my credit that are a result of identity theft and are not mine.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On or about XX/XX/2019 there was engine failure in a vehicle I had financed by Bridgecrest with GAP insurance through XXXX. I spoke with several agents at XXXX and was initially informed my GAP insurance would cover the replacement engine and its parts. A few days later I spoke with XXXX again and was informed they would only cover the replacement engine but not a vital part that will make the engine work. On or about XX/XX/2019 I contacted the dealer where I purchased the vehicle to seek assistance but they were unable to assist. On XX/XX/2019 I contacted Bridgecrest and informed them it does not make sense for me to have a vehicle and to continue to make on-time monthly payments if the vehicle does not work and I am unable to drive it. I advised Bridgecrest I am willing to voluntarily surrender the vehicle. They agreed to retrieve the vehicle after I provided the repair facility my insurance company towed it to. They explained to me the vehicle would be sold and the purchase amount would be credited to my balance. I explained to them this is fine. The account was then listed to my credit report as an involuntary repossession. I filed an IL AG complaint in efforts to have the status accurately reflecting a voluntary repossession. After Bridgecrest received my IL AG complaint ( their response is attached ), they contacted me and informed me the vehicle it will still be reported as an involuntary repossession. I explained to them how could you purposely report inaccurate information to the credit reporting agencies. I initiated the surrender due to before mentioned issues. I made all of my payment on time since I signed into the contract. I continued to make my payments even after the engine failed on the vehicle. I stopped making payments once the vehicle was in their possession. Prior to this incident I did research on this finance company. Although they have many bad reviews, I still decided to go into an agreement with them. Additionally, within their response to my IL AG complaint they stated the engine was replaced by the repair facility. This is inaccurate information. The repair facility put the old engine back in the vehicle for Bridgecrest to return it. The agent at the repair facility informed me since I was not picking up the vehicle and that Bridgecrest would be retrieving it, they would not install the replacement engine because XXXX would not cover the labor costs. The replacement engine was never installed. How can they report information that is not accurate?"

It usually takes 72 hours. The 72 hours passed and I called back on XX/XX/19 and nothing had been done to the account. Conns said they would have to create another ticket and it should take 72 hours to complete. The account had not been closed and the current pbalance has gone up to {$11.00} plus a {$48.00} late fee which makes no sense. I have paid Conns 's on time and never been late on a payment for three years. Can someone please help me get this resolved? I don't want it to hit my credit when the final payment of {$55.00} was made a week before the scheduled due date."

REVOVE LATE PAYMENT STATUS FROM XX/XX/2013 PERMANENTLY!!!"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, we filed a complaint with the CFPB because Fay Servicing had not responded within 30 days to our appeal or application for a modification. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a letter from Fay Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX stating that we were approved for a deferment on our loan. The letter stated, "" With a deferment, the total past due balance is deferred to the end of the loan. This second unpaid principal balance does not come due, until the loan matures or is paid in full. '' We contacted our customer service representative, XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX to accept the deferment. XXXX XXXX was not available so we spoke with another representative, XXXX. XXXX confirmed that we accepted the deferment and would put the process through with our acceptance. We emailed the applications department at Fay Servicing our acceptance as well. We were told a conferment letter would be sent to us with a XXXX label. We asked how long would it take for the letter to be drafted. XXXX said it usually takes about a week or so and said he would stay on top of it to make sure it gets out soon. He also told us that all foreclosure proceedings were on hold and suspended for now. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we called to follow up with XXXX XXXX and he said the letter had not been drafted and it would take another week to be done. We asked to speak with his manager, XXXX XXXX, who told us that we had been approved in the system on XX/XX/XXXX but that the deferment we were approved for was different than what was written in the letter sent to us on XX/XX/XXXX and sent to the CFPB. XXXX said that the large deferment that we were approved for was for half of the amount past due to be paid in monthly payments for 6 months in addition to the regular monthly payment and the other half would be added to the back of the loan. This is NOT what was written in the letter from Fay Servicings legal department, please see attached letter. We told him that this was not what was written in the letter from his legal department to us and the CFPB. We requested to speak with his supervisor to resolve this matter. We are awaiting a call back from his manager, XXXX XXXX. 
The letter also promised that the foreclosure proceedings are on hold, but we do not believe that to be the case."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I looked at auto loan quotes on XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX gave me two offers for with different interest rates ( they told me they did one via XXXX XXXX  XXXX and the other via XXXX XXXX   XXXX ). The problem is since these were two auto loan quotes given on the same date ( XXXX XXXX ) by the same dealer ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for a new car, it still shows as two different inquiries. Both these inquiries fall under the category of "" Automobile Dealers, New ''. Based on the effects of shopping for auto loan per CFPB : Any requests or "" inquiries '' by these lenders for your credit score ( s ) that took place within a time span ranging from 14 days to 45 days will only count as a single inquiry ( XXXX XXXX   XXXX ) But still these are showing as two separate enquiries on XXXX XXXX by transunion, your help will be greatly appreciated to resolve this problem."
Debt collection,"Dear CFPB I have auto and home insurance policy with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX had underwritten this policy with XXXX XXXX. Recently they put me with other insurance by switching from XXXX. 

Here by I am attaching a letter from XXXX that I had received about my policy is being closed by XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX has settled out my bill and paid me back my remaining balance from my early payment which is showed in my credit card bill in another attached file. 

Later they send me a new bill with remaining balance which I informed them as paid through before settlement as informed by XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

There is a clear issue running between two persons in XXXX. I never new about XXXX before until XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote my policy with them and had switched me from XXXX XXXX to new Insurance company. 

I also attached copy of emails that I wrote to XXXX about informing them that my bills were paid through XXXX XXXX XXXX and offer another chance to go over it about inquiring why an unpaid balance appears. I also offer them to talk with XXXX XXXX XXXX about that and requested to communicate with me twice. 

Following that XXXX never return back informing the bifurcation to me about the amount paid to them by me and the amount was returned by them. 
I was considered not paid while my credit card was on file for deduction and they did not charge me for that. 
And while asking XXXX XXXX XXXX through whom I was paying my Insurance bill with has informed me that all charges were settled out. 

With ignoring all those facts about me reaching out to resolve any standing issue, XXXX is just out of their way for collecting blindly without any details of what charges they are unpaid for. 
There is no details to resolve the issue with me and reached out to credit collectors because I am overly paid with their bills and they just think they can get some more last time again!!! 


While talking with credit collection services twice on XX/XX/XXXX through which XXXX is trying to collect money I was told that remaining balance might be from cancellation charges! XXXX I was never informed that by XXXX or XXXX but now by XXXX. When I informed that the bill was being taken care by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they even told me that the bill has come to them from corporate office and they do not talk to XXXX level showing their clear intention just to threat me about ruining my credit and debt collection. This is on recorded conversation."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","This also fits under the fraud category, but I've already tried to dispute my fraudulent experience with Paypal and they refused to help based on their own policies about money transfers between "" friends/family '' vs. business transactions. 

Ultimately, I bought tickets for a very small local show through someone selling on the XXXX discussion page. After texting back and forth, they seemed legitimate and of course after the money transfer was initiated is when it began to appear suspicious. I IMMEDIATELY disputed the transaction with Paypal and considering they said the user wouldn't receive funds until the following Monday ( transaction was on a Thursday ) it seems highly likely they could have cancelled the transaction in time if they cared even slightly about their customers. They closed the case simply because they don't provide purchase protection on that type of transaction. 

Overall, their website needs to do better and take more initiative in preventing this type of fraud. I was told to pay the scam artist through friends/family format and wasn't initially suspicious because Paypal claims this method does not come with additional fees. So yeah, when it's a peer to peer payment it makes sense that they wouldn't want added fees. Well, the first misleading information is that this method does in fact, still come with fees. {$4.00} of additional fees, to be specific. Secondly, they need to do a better job of stating that when sending through family/friends you WILL NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK. PERIOD. If you care about your customers, spell it out. I did a quick search on their website for customer protection and found a page that made me feel secure with my decision. Well of course, when I go back to the page and read the fine print and details it turns out that my transaction was of course, not covered. 

You're the leading money transferring service in the world. Do better. 

Also, I filed a formal complaint against the user with customer service. All they did was limit his ability to sell, which of course, means he can continue to accept money and scam other Paypal customers. Paypal does the bare minimum to protect its customers and prevent fraud."

Debt collection,"I am filing this complaint against Midland Credit Management. Midland has failed to provide me with requested information about the alleged debt. I have made several attempts to rectify this by written dispute letters to them and the credit reporting agencies. All of my efforts in sending certified letters to them were of little or no avail. On XX/XX/2019, I received a demand letter from this debt collector Midland,  stating they were "" uncertain of what you are specifically disputing ''. In my disputed letters, I clearly and respectfully ask in my letter for documentation of the following : ( 1 ) The signed copy of the original consumer contract, a contractual agreement that you say I owe and agreed to pay you ; ( 2 ) Any receipt ( s ) of sale ( s ) of the alleged debt ; ( 3 ) Copy of your debt collection rights, license or any proof that Midland is licensed to collect this debt in the state of Florida. Midland 's demand letter never included any of the requested information that would show ownership of this account. Let it also be mentioned, that failure to respond to a consumer 's good faith request for documentation makes it impossible for the consumer to make an informed decision regarding the alleged debt. I hope this matter can be resolved soon and that it be taken care of amicably as my credit has taken a hit because of it."

In XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase asking for this letter and they forwarded me to their Rewards department. The Rewards department was extremely rude and hostile and told me they could provide me no such thing. 

On XX/XX/2019 I submitted a note through the Chase contact options. I explained what had happened, the fact that I had to pay {$82.00} for a different health insurance policy in XXXX because they would not provide me the letter, in addition to the {$450.00} a year I pay on this card to have benefits like travel insurance.

Debt collection,"On about XX/XX/XXXX, a notice was received from XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. about a health club membership that was in collection for a gym called XXXX XXXX in New Hampshire. After looking into the membership ( my daughter 's ) and actions taken, I saw that my daughter had followed procedures to end that membership in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and again on XX/XX/XXXX to discuss. My daughter contacted him prior to my conversation to allow me to speak on her behalf. XXXX told me that it didn't matter if she had cancelled her membership, and in fact that nothing she had done up to that point mattered at all, the only thing that mattered was that she owed {$190.00} and had to pay that. 

I tried to explain what actions had been taken up to that point, but he just spoke over me and was clear in that he had no interest in anything that I had to say. 

He said that if she didn't pay the {$190.00}, the amount would go up. When I asked why it would increase ( concerned about timelines with payment ) he said that legal fees when they sue her would be tacked on to the amount and suggested that it would be about {$1800.00}. 

I tried to further explain that she had cancelled by emailing the contract company and XXXX told me that email was not an acceptable way to cancel her membership, and that in fact the only way to cancel was for her to send a certified letter requesting cancellation with 30 days notice. I contacted the contract company to learn that was not true, and in fact email is the appropriate way to cancel. 

Even after hearing these facts from me, XXXX continued to apply pressure for this debt to be paid, threatening action with the credit bureaus to damage my daughters credit rating. 

We will pay this debt out of fear for her credit, not out of the legitimacy of the debt. Since the amount is so low, it isn't worth even seeking relief through the court because legal fees would eclipse the {$190.00}. But, the practices of XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX and XXXX XXXX should not be allowed to continue. He illegally threatened legal action, made false statements about the cancellation procedures that should have been followed and continued to attempt to collect a debt where serious doubt should have existed as to it's validity. These are all illegal actions on his part. Not once did he even say that he would look into the debt 's validity or attempted cancellation of the gym membership. 

He likened himself to a judge and indicated that there was no higher authority than himself in this matter. When I contacted customer care at XXXX XXXX, those emails were immediately forwarded to XXXX, which caused some further concern on my part as to me being able to find any acceptable resolution."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",I signed up for a member ship with sofi a few month 's ago i started to utilize the services offered. Then in the beginning of XXXX i had a issue with my external bank account where i was getting unauthorized transactions so my bank advises me that they need to send a stop payment to all my transactions to be able get my funds back. So i contracted sofi to let them know what the situation and was and sofis customer service told me my account will be at a negative and that to avoid any account fees i needed to make another transfer to being my account current. So on XX/XX/2019 i transferred {$20000.00} because i ended up closing my external account due to fear of my account being tampered with i then transfered my remaining balance to my sofi account. So my sofi membership account holds my funds totaling {$35000.00}. My complaint is sofi isnt even a bank how are they able to hold all my money and not release my funds to me its been 7 days they have bern with holding my funds and thats not right. I feel like they are breaking some sort of law because it's my money it came from my external bank. Ive tired emailing calling and they do not give me no answers yet my funds just sit there. I thought that maybe its due to assumption of illegal account activity but that's not possible because they make you log into your external bank to verify account owner ship. I just want my funds to be accessible for my use not to be held by a company that isn't even a bank.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a wells fargo secured credit card to build credit without reading all the horrible reviews on this card.

I've called for an upgrade to a credit line a few times & I am given 3 reasons which I dont agree with, 1 being other deliquent accounts which was never explained to me. My credit wasnt good to begin with which is why I went with a secured card to Build my credit. 
Ive never received any paperworks proving that there has been a deny on a credit line or reason why. 
I now have 3 other credit cards which are not secure and I dont understand why my card can not be upgraded. 
I was given false information from this branch, made on time payments, always paid more than my minimum havent went over my limit which was told I would need to do to upgrade. And now i cant upgrade because i have deliquent accounts which are unrelated to Well Fargo overall. 
This is my oldest account and it will hurt my credit to close. 
This is not right and they lied to take a deposit for an account that will stay secured forever and may never be upgraded according to the bank now."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I purchased XXXX tickets for my son and I from what I thought was reputable dealer for {$160.00}.

After money sent I waited for tickets to arrive but nothing. Phone calls were sent straight to voicemail and texts were no longer responded to. After reaching out to my bank to report the fraud, I was told that they hold no responsibility for XXXX usage despite the money transfer service being in their application. I was also not given information regarding transaction despite Wells Fargo requesting information when utilizing app. I believe that is a shame that Wells Fargo and XXXX  XXXX XXXX promote and make money off of an service that provides zero responsibility for fraud and insecure transactions."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There are fraudulent accounts on my credit report with Equifax, That Equifax knowingly placed on my credit reports even after being sent a signed law enforcement Identity Theft Affidavit clearly explaining the crime, and clearly showing the unauthorized accounts.

I never received any cards or account information from these accounts, Therefore I did not authorize these I never signed any cards and the accounts were opened at an address I haven't ever lived at. In addition to these two accounts, Equifax allowed for XXXX XXXX to place two UNAUTHORIZED FRAUDULENT Credit cards on my credit report, and XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card on my credit report. They have been notified these are contained on the Identity Theft Affidavit that Equifax was sent and I will re attach here once again. These accounts not only show the incorrect credit limit but each of these instituions were notified that I am a victim of Identity theft."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax allowed Fraudulent credit accounts to be opened in my name without authorization and these accounts were opened online, only after my wallet was stolen. Not only did the thief 's forward my address but they also hacked my email address and used my information for their own gain. I submitted an FTC Law Enforcement Identity Theft affidavit to Equifax 2 months ago clearly stating the crime. Equifax blocked the fraudulent account 's due to the FCRA 605 ( B ) Law that requires accounts that have been created or established as a result of identity theft be blocked. Equifax later recsidended the block on some of these accounts without providing any documentation. These accounts are still fraudulent and I did not receive any information from these instituions on these accounts and I have attempted to contact them over 6 times now. First of all the two Accounts for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which include a Line of Credit and an Auto Loan, are Fraudulent. I did not authorize these accounts, these were not signed by me and I never signed any information on these accounts. I do not have access to these accounts and Equifax has been notified as these accounts were listed on my FTC affidavit. Additionally, Without providing any clear explicit information, I did not authorize Equifax to rescend any blocks these accounts are still identity theft and I was never provided with any documentation on these accounts from Equifax no XXXX XXXX. Please follow the FCRA 605 ( B ) Law as I have clearly and precisely described the crime, and provided documentation. In addition the XXXX XXXX Credit Card is also fraudulent which was also listed on the Affidavit.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax ignored all of my questions in my latest complaint. Equifax states they verify that XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX accounts are accurate and mine yet never provide any proof of investigation to me. Equifax has an address listed that is incorrect that they never removed thats fraudulent. Equifax did not complete an investigation and has continued to lie. Equifax also stated they verified XXXX yet I received a letter from the company XXXX telling me they would remove the account from my credit as they verified it was fraud. Yet equifax again said they verified this account as accurate. They do not investigate and the identity theft occurred after the equifax data breach. Additionally equifax is lying and not providing proof of investigations. Equifax ignores my questions and does not provide resolution. Equifax is also allowing creditors to access my reports illegally without my permission. Nor written consent. Equifax is causing damages to me from actually placing fraud on my reports. These accounts have already been verified as FRAUDULENT. From XXXX  and XXXX. Yet equifax states they verified these as accurate. Yet they deleted only one XXXX XXXX account, yet not the other two. Which again proves equifax doesnt care to resolve fraud. They continually lie. They must be doing this to other consumers too as I will continue to write complaints until Equifax quits lying and stops causing personal damages by placing fraudulent accounts on my reports.

Additionally my postal address had been forwarded and I have recently corrected these issues including getting my email addresses correct. EQUIFAX has already been notified and has received law enforcement documentation and FTC Identity Theft Affidavits for each account that has been mentioned and discussed as fraud. Equifax deleted these fraudulent accounts to comply with the FCRA laws since they have been notified of fraud. I then check my reports today and see EQUIFAX has placed one of the accounts that I never applied for and already marked as fraud BACK on my equifax report. Again these are FRAUDULENT. I am a victim of Identity theft, you have received documents from Law enforcement agencies. You have received FTC Affidavits explicitly explaining the crime and how i became a victim. By Placing fraudulent information on someones credit report and not advising the consumer you are placing this fraud knowing its fraud is against the law. 

You placed an account for XXXX XXXX which I never applied for back on my credit report. Again this account is fraudulent, This account was already deleted. You have the amounts incorrect, you have the account numbers incorrect XXXX has already been notified this was fraud. This was applied for with an address I have not ever lived at. They advised me the last payment made was from a "" XXXX XXXX '' Which I have never been associated with. I want this account blocked from my file immediately. You can't place fraud back on someones credit reports especially when this account was already listed in my previous FTC Reports i have sent to your agency."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a copy of a promissory note from the organization XXXX for a Federal Stafford Loan from XXXX. The personal information on the document is either irrelevant or fabricated. XXXX was able to garnish my wages without contacting me. 

On the promissory note, the information provided is completely fabricated and uses my maiden name ; I legally changed my name in XXXX. I lived in XXXX - XXXX XXXX - from XXXX to XXXX, at which time Federal Stafford Loans were taken out in my name in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. Additionally, the information connected to the two references is not even people I am connected with. The mailing address, phone number, and email address are fake. According to XXXX, the loan was disbursed to the University XXXX XXXX ; however, the University XXXX XXXX states that they do not have a record of the disbursement. 

In closing, a loan of {$21000.00} was taken out using inaccurate and fraudulent information connected to me ; the only information which is correct is my birthdate and social security number."
Checking or savings account,"I made a legitimate deposit from my employers payroll account. Bank of America is now holding the entire check amount for no reason that they can tell me other than the fact that because it is a manual transaction. Which is not the case. I get me paychecks deposited biweekly every pay period. This current pay period XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX was not a direct deposit, it was a physical check due to a mess up through my payroll department. I manually deposited my PAYcheck into my local Bank of America ATM. Then was told on the final receipt that my PAYcheck would be be held without reason for over 7 consecutive days being XXXX XXXX, 2019. Unfortunately I have to live paycheck to paycheck but the fact that my 80 hours worked is being held another additional week if VERY frustrating and almost unethical. I NEED my actual paycheck that I am entitled to for my time."
Checking or savings account,"Back in late XXXX I attempted to close a retirement account with Wells Fargo. The account was funded by XXXX XXXX by way of a weekly prevailing wage contribution, which began in XXXX of 2015. The account amassed a little over {$16000.00}. When I inquired with the account representatives via phone calls about closing the account they told me the account had a loan balance of approximately {$300.00}. The amount outstanding would be deducted from the balance as well as a {$40.00} service fee, and finally AFTER their deductions a 20 % Federal income tax fee would be calculated from the net amount. The loan had already been paid in full, so this was a flat-out LIE. Since this time I have observed the account still having a balance of {$300.00}. So I called them to have the remaining {$300.00} sent to me. They said sure they would AFTER they again deducted another {$40.00} service fee and an additional 20 % Federal income Tax from the remaining $ XXXX.AGAIN THEY ARE SCAM ARTISTS. They claim to be a part of Wells Fargo but in truth they are NOT. Their phone number is : XXXX ... ... CONSUMER BEWARE ... ... ... ...."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Dear Sir/Ma'am, Good afternoon! I bought a mattress from XXXX XXXX  in XXXX  XXXX, VA in XX/XX/XXXX and used financing through Wells Fargo to pay it off in installments. Shortly after that, military obligations caused me to move to XXXX XXXX, CA. I had trouble getting auto payments set up after getting calls and calling Wells Fargo several times. I would get calls that the payment was due, I would pay it, and then ask why auto pay was not taking out the payments. After a few months of this happening, I then ended up deploying. When I returned the account had gone to collections and also been charged off. I received no emails about any of this happening. I then settled the entire account balance with Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX. My credit score had been increasing, due to no other negative remarks, and so I decided to send Wells Fargo a letter asking for a possible goodwill adjustment. The request was declined, but then I noticed that I had taken another big hit to my credit score. When I looked, Wells Fargo had updated the date reported on my account to XX/XX/XXXX. I'm not sure if they have the right to do this, but it seems unfair that an old debt could come back and negatively affect me well after it's been paid off and settled. I would just like some clarification as Wells Fargo has been unwilling to help me or give me answers. Thank you very much!

Debt collection,THIS COMPANY IS REPORTING AN ACCOUNT ON MY CREDIT THAT IS NOT MINE/INACCURATE.FRAUD. I DID NOT GIVE NY PERMISSION TO REPORT THIS ACCOUNT AND I WAS NOT NOTIFIED THAT THIS ACCOUNT WAS OR WILL BE REPORTED TO MY CREDIT REPORT.
Mortgage,"These particular facts and circumstances are detailed and involved. I try to summarize below the key facts and circumstances, and I will be happy to provide additional information. In particular, I would be happy to provide all or some of the written communications that I have provided to Chase representatives regarding these matters. 

In a XXXX written Durable Power of Attorney ( "" POA '' ), my  cousin XXXX XXXX XXXX, now aged XXXX, named me and another cousin as his duly authorized power of attorney agents. 

Mr. XXXX is experiencing severe physical and mental problems. Among other things, Mr. XXXX is XXXX has XXXX XXXX, has had XXXX XXXX XXXX, and has been treated ( inside and outside of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for  various XXXX XXXX issues. Since XX/XX/XXXX, my cousins and I have been trying diligently to assist Mr. XXXX with his physical, mental, living and financial circumstances. 

Mr. XXXX had been living in a single family residence in XXXX, XXXX that he purchased via a mortgage from Chase. I understand ( but I have not been able to confirm ) that the mortgage is a federally insured "" rural housing loan ''. The home property address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXXXXXX XXXX   XXXX. The Chase account/mortgage loan number is XXXX. 

After his wife died, Mr. XXXX lived alone in the home. Based on alarming information that we received from a fellow church member of Mr. XXXX 's in XXXX, my cousins and I became concerned that Mr. XXXX may be unable, physically and/or mentally and/or financially, to live alone. We also became worried that Mr. XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, one of my cousins and I travelled to XXXX to visit Mr. XXXX. For a variety of reasons, we concluded that a "" family intervention '' was required. The home was in an appalling condition. 

With his consent, the family moved Mr. XXXX to XXXX  ( where key members of Mr. XXXX 's XXXX and XXXX  families live ). Mr. XXXX has been confined as a resident in a XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX   He has received in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At present, Mr. XXXX is not able to live alone and/or manage his own affairs. 

This complaint relates to how Chase has handled Mr. XXXX 's home mortgage. For many months, Mr. XXXX had not made timely payments on his mortgage. Mr. XXXX, whose regular income only is a modest monthly payment from social security, has very limited financial resources. 

Beginning in XX/XX/XXXX ( when my cousin and I traveled to XXXX, XXXX to investigate Mr. XXXX 's circumstances ), I have engaged in regular oral and written communications with various Chase representatives. I provided to Chase, and Chase accepted, Mr. XXXX 's Durable Power of Attorney. Chase approved me to communicate with Chase personnel regarding these matters. I have explained in detail to Chase representatives Mr. XXXX 's particular facts and circumstances. 

My overarching efforts have been to resolve Mr. XXXX 's mortgage situation short of/without the need for foreclosure proceedings -- and short of/without the need for the time, efforts and expenses that are attendant to such proceedings. 

I have asked Chase representatives specifically and repeatedly, in writing and orally, to authorize a short sale or a deed in lieu of foreclosure. 

With Chase 's prior consent, the property currently is listed for sale by a local realtor. 

I learned today that Chase has initiated foreclosure proceedings and plans to sell the home at auction on or about XX/XX/XXXX. 

With due respect, I believe that Chase has acted callously, improperly, unfairly and unreasonably regarding my cousin Mr. XXXX and this property. Chase has failed to evaluate Mr. XXXX 's unique situation carefully and/or individually. Chase has bounced me around from department to department, from person to person. Chase continues to send Mr. XXXX form letters that do not account for his particular circumstances and my months of communications with Chase representatives. 

My request on behalf of Mr. XXXX is simple, straightforward and very easy to implement : permit the current efforts by the realtor to sell the property via a short sale, and if that is unsuccessful dispose of the property via a deed in lieu of foreclosure. 

Mr. XXXX should not be charged or assessed any additional costs, fees or expenses, whether associated with foreclosure proceedings or otherwise. I have proactively been trying since XX/XX/XXXX to resolve this situation in ways that are fair and reasonable to both Chase and MrXXXX XXXX.

Though I gave them complete and accurate answers, they said they can not verifiy who I am. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was transferred to XXXX, Employee number XXXX. He would not transfer me to his supervisor, saying he doesnt have one. Additionally, I asked to speak to someone in their XXXX, GA office for two reasons. First, I have a hard time understanding their representatives that dont speak English as their first language. Second, I needed to speak to someone concerning the fraud issue.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on my credit report from Transunion that they had reported that I had a delinquent account that had gone to collections from XXXX XXXX in XXXX  XXXX WI. I had paid that account off XX/XX/XXXX. This made my credit score go down. I called XXXX XXXX and they emailed me the paperwork that stated it had never been to collections and I had paid it off. I filed a dispute with Transunion and sent that paperwork to them so they could clear up my credit report. They removed the delinquent acct. and that it had gone to collections. My score went back up. In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed it was back on my credit report as my score had gone down again. I filed another dispute with Transunion in XXXX XXXX and on that investigation they are saying it is correct information that is being reported to my credit report. I am getting upset that Tranunion can play with my credit report like this.

I am maintaining a careful record of my communications with you for the purpose of filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Attorney General 's Office, should you continue reporting this erroneous item"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Through this portal I have filed complaints against XXXX, XXXX, & Transunion. The specifics of the complaint has been provided to several times. They have and are currently displaying blatant disregard for the "" Fair Credit Reporting Act '' known as the FCRA. I mailed disputes ( XX/XX/2018 ) which all three agencies failed to respond to in timely fashion. Not only have they failed to respond but they continue to display malicious intent by contacting for instance a creditor and claim fraud on my behalf when I merely requested they investigate a late.

This behavior flys in face of the intent of the FCRA and should be met with the most severe scrutiny. These agencies use a great deal of misdirection to cause confusion and hopelessness. Please investigate my claims ..."
Debt collection,"Back in XXXX I received some old forwarded mail from an address I have not lived at for a long time. Included was a collection letter from Credit Protection Association, LP stating I owe money from sold old toll bills. 

The license plate number listed on their letter is not mine. 

I attempted to contact them several times but they refuse to give any contact info other than where to send payments. I finally was able to find an email address and when I emailed them they replied that I should contact the DMV and the NTTA to find out why they were given the wrong license plate information. 

Clearly they do not understand federal law under FDCPA requires them to validate the debt and does not require me to find out why they have incorrect info. 

I have continually asked them to validate the debt and they refuse. 

They also can not even spell my name correctly on their collection letters"

Credit card or prepaid card,"This issue is with my credit card with Best Buy store card. In the month of XX/XX/2019 my credit card statement showed online unauthorized charges, so I immediately contacted Best Buy customer services and was transferred to the fraud department and reported the unauthorized charges totaling {$5600.00} with a previous balance of {$0.00}. I was told an investigation would take place. In XXXX I received a letter stating that the investigation was completed and that there was no evidence of fraud and I would be responsible for the purchases. I then contacted Best Buy Fraud department and questioned what the reason was for that showed that I was responsible. I was told that the notes were not specified clearly, so they gave me the option of having a second request for an investigation. In XXXX I received the conclusion of the second investigation. The letter and stated that they had completed their investigation and still find myself responsible. The letter did not have an explanation all they provided was the orders that showed an email that was used that was not mine and also a phone number that is not mine with the order delivered to a store in the city of XXXX XXXX, Ca. 
I notified Best Buy again and I was told by the Fraud department that I was responsible because of the purchases were delivered to my home. That is a huge contradictory when their paperwork shows a screenshot of the order was delivered to a store. I asked Best Buy to pull their video cameras and I was told they could not do that. In my opinion that would be an option to prove that I did not place these purchases nor picked them up. What is the purpose of video cameras if they refuse to use them to protect them and the consumers. After getting no resolution from Best Buy and notified XXXX, Ca Sheriffs Department and made a police report. When the officer that took my report contacted Best Buy himself they told him they refuse to deal with the Police Department because they are not authorized on the account. I find that completely wrong! I feel my rights as a consumer have been violated by Best Buy Franchise and I have written numerous letters to the Corporate office and have had nothing back from them. I have to continuously pay this bill that I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR so my credit isn't compromised. I am asking for help from the CFPB to exercise my rights as a consumer for fraud charges that Best Buy will not remove from my account. I should not be responsible for charges that I did not authorize nor received. 
The police report number for this dispute is XXXX from XXXX, Ca Sherriffs Department."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",went to buy a new car and the dealer sent to different banks for loans we didnt know about and affected our credit report didnt give them permission or they never told us going to do this
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Barclays Visa regarding transactions on my credit card statement. Barclay offered transfer balances/promotional checks interest free through specified dates. I availed myself of those "" convenience checks '' and used them since there the interest rate is 0 % through specified dates. Upon reviewing the schedule of convenience checks which were used, I learned from the credit card company of how they post the payments which are made to the account. 

The complaint that I am filing due to the fact that the methodology used to apply the consumer payments is an abusive practice which puts the consumer at a significant disadvantage and allows the credit card company to manipulate the payments made on the account in a manner which unfairly penalizes the consumer. 

Here is what they do : There is a balance carried on Standard Purchases : in my case it was {$1000.00} ( 29 % APR ) There are also numerous Balance Transfer/Check Promotions which were taken out by me on numerous occasions with different ending promotional dates upon which any remaining balance will then be charged at the specified interest rate of 29 %. 

I make payments greater than the minimum amount. I was expecting that the entire payment amount would be applied to the balance with the highest interest rate. I wanted to payoff the balance since there is an APR of 29 % whereby the other balance transfers have a 0 % APR until a date out in the future. Barclays stated that anything above the minimum amount is applied to the other balance transfer/check promotions in any manner which they desire to apply them. I requested that they apply the entire payment that I made to the amount with the highest interest rate but they stated that they will not do it. The company then proceeded to apply the remaining payment to a check balance /transfer which was just taken out. When I asked why didn't they apply the amount to the oldest transfer balance ( since this amount will start to accrue interest on XX/XX/XXXX ) they indicated that they can apply it to any amount they want.. In my case they applied the remaining payment to the balance transfer/promotional check with the lasted date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) where the balance will start to accrue on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The remedy which I am looking from Barclay is for them to apply the payment made on the account in a manner which is proper and fair. Payment which be applied in their entirety to the balances with the highest interest rates thereby allowing a fair and equitable reduction on balances with the highest rates. Furthermore, if appropriate then a payment should be allocated to the balances with the earliest coming promotional dates. Barclay should not be allowed to take advantage of consumers. Furthermore, clear and plain disclosure of this practice and not made. 

Documentation can be submitted upon request."
Vehicle loan or lease,"Recently, I purchased used car from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, TX.I went in originally wanting to purchase a used XXXX XXXX XXXX.

They are charging me {$12000.00} to finance this car. Take note, I put down {$4000.00} on the car. So in total I'll be paying almost half of what the car is worth ( {$26000.00} ) after the 72 months is over. I feel completely robbed and felt that I was an easy target.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","After reviewing the financial history of account, below are the items I believe are in inaccurate and would like to formally dispute. 

XX/XX/XXXX a bill/due date in the amount of {$990.00} that differs from the principal but without detailed, itemized expenses. 
XX/XX/XXXX late charge of {$30.00} that should not have been assessed. 
XX/XX/XXXX a final payment of {$240.00} was made which was the amount that a XXXX representative stated was the remaining amount due. 

According to the payment history sent by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, there is a balance of {$16.00} that was remaining but there is no bill/due date noted that shows at any time any representative of XXXX either by mail or telephonically informed me of the {$16.00} balance. 

XX/XX/XXXX notes that the account was noted as a Charge Off even though the loan had been completely paid off via the amount XXXX stated on XX/XX/XXXX and I was never notified of a remaining balance of {$16.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX notes an additional repossession expense charge off in the amount of {$400.00} that should not have been assessed as it was previously paid and again not in the stated pay off amount, via XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX late charge off fees of {$120.00} that should not have been assessed. 
XX/XX/XXXX non sufficient funds fee/charge off fees of {$25.00} that should not have been assessed. 
XX/XX/XXXX interest fees/charge off of {$.00} that should not have been assessed. 

In addition, the amounts paid on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX equates to a total of {$1000.00} which is greater than the final bill/due date that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX and stated a final payment of {$990.00}. This was the last bill/payment request that XXXX XXXX mailed to me. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX the paid off vehicle that this loan was secured on was traded in to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, VA. Legal ownership of the vehicle then transferred. The XX/XX/XXXX payment in the amount of {$560.00} should not be represented on my financial history account as the final payment as made on XX/XX/XXXX, the vehicle was sold to the dealership on or around XX/XX/XXXX, thus I was no longer the legal owner or in possession of the vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX. This payment activity transpired 9 months after legal ownership had transferred."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/2019 I sent a letter requesting verification of the debt that was owed. I also requested verification stating that I allowed them to obtain my medical information. It has been more than 60 days and I have not received any correspondence back. Per the FCRA the creditor had 30 days to submit verification of the debt which they failed to do because I do not have a contract with this creditor. The creditor has no contract with MY SIGNATURE on It that shows verification or permission from me to allow my information to be shared. Due to them not being the original creditor, no money is owed"
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX at roughly XXXX XXXX I deposited {$320.00} into a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX atm, which is listed as a co-OP of Navy federal credit union. The machine stated that this transaction can not be completed at this time. It then returned my card, but it kept my money. I immediately called Navy Federal to file a report. They informed me that they would initiate an investigation which could take 45 days to complete, but also that in 10 days a provisional credit would be given to my account. I also went to XXXX XXXX XXXX the very next morning to see if they would take action, however I was told that since I didn't have an account with them I had to file a claim with NFCU. Finally on XX/XX/XXXX the provisional credit was credited to my account only to be reversed 4 days later. Upon there investigation, Navy federal says that XXXX XXXX  XXXX claims there was no overages on that day. I would like them to pull the video surveillance from that evening. Furthermore I would like to know if that atm had been serviced shortly after my deposit. I am livid at this point and I keep thinking about what if it were a larger deposit.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/2018, I closed an XXXX XXXX Account. I had been dealing with several issues of identity theft, related to my ex-husband 's theft of my credit cards and personal information. The bills for this card were not going to my address as a result of this. When I was alerted to the debt, I attempted to get the debt consolidated with XXXX XXXX XXXX, an organization I had been working with to pay off the debts accrued by my ex husband, in an effort to repair my credit. XXXX XXXX made it very difficult to consolidate under this program, even though I was able to do this easily with my bank, which had recommended the program as a legitimate non-profit debt consolidation ( not forgiveness ) program. 

I spoke to an XXXX representative and explained the situation to the individual on the phone, stating that I would pay off the debt in full, but that I wanted adverse information about the debt off my credit report, as I had not acquired the debt, nor had I received any indication the debt had been accrued, since the bills were not sent to my address. 

I agreed to a lump sum payoff under the understanding that this adverse information would be removed from my credit report. The cost was substantial to me, around {$10000.00}, but it was worth the price of fixing my credit and moving on from the debts accrued in my name. I was under the impression the individual I spoke with on the phone agreed to these terms. However, several months later, the adverse information is still on my credit report and, in fact, until last month, XXXX XXXX was still reflecting that I had not paid the debt, though I had done so more than a year earlier. 

I am very distressed by this situation, as the identity theft has severely impacted my credit score and made it nearly impossible to move on from my divorce and find a new home for myself and my children. I would like this issue resolved, and for further advice on how to remove other negative items on my report that have been the result of identity theft."
Debt collection,Today XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX CST I was contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX  of XXXX KS XXXX. I had received approximately XXXX calls from a phone I did not recognize for the past 24 hours. Their persistence caused me to answer to the last call. Upon answering and the original representative repeatedly stating it was for. Personal business matter and not an attempt to collect a debt I was skeptical. The representative had my name and birthdate and didnt identify a company until I demanded the name of his employer. This was disconcerting as again he kept saying regarding a personal business matter and never an attempt to collect a debt. I disconnected that call then looked up the company obtained the XXXX number and called them. Another representative then advised this is an attempt to collect a debt. I was shocked as I use XXXX XXXX to monitor my credit and about cleaning my credit up in XXXX. I hadnt opened any new accounts or went delinquent on any account. This representative then advised that I owed approximately {$230.00} or so for a payday loan owed to Advance America. I was shocked at the last communications I had this company was in XXXX. Since Ive receive a copy of my credit report at least once per year from all three bureaus and have never seen an entry from this company. I informed the representative that if this debt was indeed valid at XXXX point in time it isnt actionable at this point as it is beyond the 6 year statute of limitations for collection debt in Tennessee pursuant to Tennessee T. C.A. 28-3-109. I reside in Tennessee and only dealt with Advance America inside of Tennessee. The representative then advised me that she could still collect this zombie debt and could use the the credit bureaus as a recourse.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit report showing a collection from a company that about a balance that i never had with them..
Debt collection,"This letter is to initiate a complaint against Dyke ONeal collection agency,  located in XXXX, Texas ( please see attachment provided ). 

At an earlier time, I was forced into a short sale of a property I had owned due to vandalism. The mortgage holder required that a {$5000.00} promissory note, with payments of {$42.00} per month. This note was subsequently turned over the Dyck ONeal for servicing. 

Dyke ONeal sent me monthly billings on a regular basis until the middle of last year ( XX/XX/XXXX ). For five months, I received no billing statements - and therefore no payments were made on the note. In XX/XX/XXXX, a  representative of Dyke ONeal contacted me by telephone and informed that the note was in arrears. I promptly brought the note current. 

Later, Dyke ONeal placed a derogatory note on my credit report, stating that I had missed five payments. I phoned the company to request that the derogatory information be removed, as I had not paid because I had received no billing statements. The company refused to do this, citing that they sent out billings as a courtesy only, and hung up the phone on me when I complained. 

I would like to request that action be taken to compel the removal of this information from my credit report. I have excellent credit otherwise, and what they have added is very damaging. 

In addition, the short sale was originally mis-reported on the credit report as a foreclosure, when this was not the case. 

This issue was already referred to the Maryland Division of Financial Regulation, but they were unable to have the derogatory information removed. Further, XXXX XXXX, XXXX at Dyck-O'Neal made several untruthful statements to that agency during the course of their investigation. 

As a result of this situation, I am looking at payments on a used car of nearly {$100.00} more PER MONTH due to the fact that my credit score dropped approximately 115 points. This is a material adverse financial impact. 

What rights do I have as a consumer regarding credit reporting agencies? There would seem to be no accountability for the veracity of their information, despite its impact on peoples lives. 

I may be reached by telephone on XXXX should you wish to discuss this matter further. Please note that if you call and receive an unusual response, you have probably reached my robocall app. I will call you back. 

Thank you in advance for your assistance."

Mortgage,"To whom it may concern Beneficial has sold our loan to XXXX XXXX around 2 years ago. Before finishing up with taking off the deferred interest home loan & side loan. We would get repeated phone calls from Beneficial that we were missing a payment. When we would go to the branch office with proof of payment, They would have no idea why we were contacted because the computer would show us current. We also have many statements that show full payment being made, but minus part of the payment and it showing up in deferred interest. But showing paid in full and never showing or saying that we were delinquent. Just before selling the loan Beneficial told us the deferred interest that we asked about was for 35 missing payments on both loans. When we tried getting information about the missing payments they would just hang up on us. When they finally did talk to us, It was just to tell us the loan was sold and they could not talk to us. We are wanting to refinance. But refuse to pay money we dont owe. {$49000.00} off home loan & {$7700.00} off side loan"

Debt collection,"I was admitted to XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/2017. Documentation as to whether or not I received intravenous contrast dye was poor. Middle record records indicate I received the contrast dye after the procedure was completed. The radiology company administering the test identified an error in their medical record system that they have not corrected. Thus they can not prove objectively that contrast was administered except to look at the radiology films which they have not provided me in a readable format. Despite the radiology company having my correct address and telephone number, I never received any bills at my residence for this service. They then sent the bill to the respondent for debt collection. Despite having the correct address and telephone number for my residence from the radiology company and having access to my credit report, the debt collector made no verifiable attempt to give me a call by telephone or send me a letter. They claim that they sent me a letter via regular mail but they can not prove its being sent or being received. Despite having my correct address and telephone number and access to my credit file, The debt collector continue to call an unrelated individual with the same last name. After not receiving a satisfactory response or payment, they placed the adverse account to my credit report. This caused me to lose a high security job offer worth {$180000.00} in salary annually. 

If the bill is in the road, I would like to pay it. However I expect to be compensated for my damages as a result of the deck collector not providing me with the opportunity to dispute the debt in a timely fashion or providing me with any notice that a debt actually was owed."

They are not completing the investigation throughly within that timeframe. At the point, I contacted Experian and asked whats being used to verify these accounts and the rep hung up in my face. These accounts have been removed from my other credit reports so I need to know why Experian is constantly reporting these accounts as accurate. According to the FCRA rules, 623 ( b ) ( 2 ) and 611 ( a ) ( 1 ), it states that any information can be disputed and MUST be INVESTIGATED and if you do not investigate and respond the CRA must delete the disputed information from its files. That fact that Ive been receiving my results back under 24 hours, one can assume that their was no investigation in that matter. I am submitting his complaint due to the lack investigation into my original dispute with Experian. I did not authorize those accounts. This is unfair practices by a credit reporting agency with no concern for the credit worthiness of a consumer."

She confirmed that I was in deferrment but said she has no obligation to update my credit reporting as the credit reporting was accurate when reported. The FTC advisory ( quoted and attached in this email ) specifically states that student loan creditors and other creditors must update information, regardless of whether or not it was accurate when reported. The Navient rep I spoke to ( XXXX XXXX ) stated that Navient is not required to follow FTC advisories. I have attached the email correspondences along with my statement from navient."

XX/XX/XXXX. I received notice in my Desktop app of Bank of America, stating I responsible for all four transactions, as follows Our records indicate that the card was present at the time of the transaction ( s ) as the chip on your card was read. In addition, your PIN may have been entered or a signature obtained. As a result, youll be responsible for the balance on the account in accordance with your Account agreement. Since Desktop app way was the only was I was notified ( no email or mail ), I noticed this message by end of XXXX. Bank of America provided no further evidence for the statements above. 
XX/XX/XXXX. I personally go to Bank of America, with a document written, asking them to re-open the case, and provide me the following : 1. The exact timing of transactions ( made with credit card ending # XXXX ) between period XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Apparently these were in-store transactions which I have never authorized. What is more significant, credit card was with me all the time. Thus, I asked for this information because I could possibly prove that I was not present during these transactions. 
2. Proof that my chip card was read, in addition to the proof that either PIN was used or my signature ( with signature scan ) 3. List of all transactions attempted with credit card ending # XXXX in the past two years, that is between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. This was related to two things - a ) I suspected that there could be more fraudulent transaction attempts, which are not visible to me as an end-customer of BoA, b ) I havent been using the card ending # XXXX, ever since I opened another reward card for better in-store deals ( that is in past two years ). 
XX/XX/XXXX. I got mail from BoA, stating, "" We've received your dispute regarding our decision on the fraud claim. Our decision hasn't changed '' Bank of America provided me no evidence about their investigation that I have asked for, I was found responsible for transactions even though I stated I haven't done it in via messaging system, and their communication with me was done very poorly and scarcely."

I was told only thing I could do was try to work out a payment plan. I called the office suing me.. I was told the garnishment had already gone through and there was nothing I could do ( they would garnish 25 % of my wages and thats that ). I explained this was the first time I was hearing about it and that I hadnt even lived in the state for the last few years and hadnt lived at that address for a lot longer.. they refused to work with me. So I reached out to the creditor, let them know I didnt recognize the debt, hadnt received paperwork, and was able to sign on to an account that had actual papers I could see pertaining to the account! Thats when I got really mad!! I have no recollection of the debt, the charges, and I feel like the creditor shouldve never opened this card because it wasnt me! There are charges from out of state that make no sense ( impossible for me to have purchased! ) Due to not knowing about this at all, I never had a chance to fight this! And they are already garnishing my wages.. I thought I had no other course of action but to let it happen. I am putting in a complaint here, I dont want this to happen to someone else because I didnt say anything."

I was alerted by several different credit monitoring accounts that a hard inquiry had been made on my XXXX credit report by Prosper/XXXX   on Sunday, XX/XX/2019. This wasn't a request for credit that I had made. 

I called Prosper Marketplace, Inc. at the number listed on my XXXX report on Monday, XX/XX/2019. 

I was given the run-around for several minutes while calling Prosper Marketplace, Inc. on XX/XX/2019. But the operator was eventually able to locate an approved loan application with my social security number and name. 

The woman on the phone remarked to me that the application had the wrong birthday and address. This remark alone proves the RFL was violated. 

I then was compelled to undertake an arduous and time-consuming process of obtaining a police report and submitting said police report to Prosper Marketplace, Inc. for the entity to request removal of said inquiry from my credit report. I went through this arduous process simply because I desired that this false and illegal inquiry, violating the RFL was removed expeditiously. 

Prosper Marketplace, Inc. has willfully violated my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681, specifically under the Red Flag Rule ( RFL ) of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ) of 2003."

I also requested they document our conversations. In XX/XX/XXXX I noticed they began reporting late payments which was inaccurate. I called them and advised them and still no resolution. I faxed proof of payments and still no resolution. I then reported a discrepancy with the credit bureaus and they declined responsibility after I submitted proof from my back. I called them to question the dispute and they stated they have a section called care team that dealt with the disputes but I was not able to speak to them regarding my dispute. They failed to assume responsibility and have impacted my credit after I have tried to contact them via fax and submitted the proof."

I deposited {$1100.00} at first time and the ATM returned {$100.00} back to me, then I put another {$2000.00} then closed the whole transaction. I found out it only showed the system took {$2000.00} not the {$3000.00} in total on the same day. All {$3000.00} are 30 latest version of {$100.00}. I just got them at a bank from XXXX.

Even though we contacted Citibank immediately, they said they would not fix their mistake until we got a letter from our first mortgage company stating that their info was wrong. And now that we have that letter, their customer service keeps failing to resolve the issue ( the last straw was today when they forwarded us to an online survey and "" special offer '' when they said they were transferring us to the HELOC department who would fix the problem ). Citibank 's customer service has been atrocious, Citibank clearly ignored information in our credit report stating that the wrongful information had been flagged, and was under review and/or already in process of being corrected ; and now that I've followed their instructions ( and spent time and money hiring a lawyer to get this fixed ) they are non-responsive via their own customer service system to get this sorted."
Checking or savings account,"I had my identity stolen on or around XX/XX/XXXX of this year. The problem is with Wells Fargo Bank and their reaction to and acknowledgement of the crime.

First I went to go pay a bill to them that suddenly was considerably larger then the paper bill I had just received. After a few transfers I was told that someone ( hacker ) had stolen my identity through the XXXX XXXX system, which is how I've always paid the bill, they told me that the hacker had "" disputed '' my payments going all the way back to XXXX of 2018. They froze the account. By doing so they didn't allow any more months or payments to be stolen. I then notified Wells Fargo. I also called the attorney general of Florida who gave me steps to follow to warn all the creditors and lenders. Wells Fargo at first was very helpful. But, some where along the way their fraud department decided they wouldn't claim their lack of security. They are flagging my account, charging me some of the disputed funds and not allowing me to open another account, there or at any other banking institutions. Even though I have filed a police report and filled out and had notarized Florida 's theft identity kit. I was told by the attorney generals office to file a complaint through this institution."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I took out a {$900.00} loan to pay the IRS to stop them from taking the next step toward collection. What I was not expecting was it costing men {$3600.00} for that loan amount. When I called thinking the loan should be paid off I was informed that I get charged DAILY interest. They do identify themselves as a XXXX tribe under XXXX XXXX in Montana. This is outright fraud. No loan should cost you triple of the amount you borrow.

This call was made back on XX/XX/XXXX. Since then I have made numerous follow up calls regarding my check, each time I have been given the run around about receiving my check. I have been told it was mailed out regular mail on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by supervisor XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX that the check was overnighted via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX but could not give me a tracking # because cashier dept was closed at the time and he would call me back the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) with that info.

Wells Fargo has not provided any reference numbers for me to track down this money or determine how to find the money. 

According to 12 CFR 1026.11 ( a ) ( 2 ) - ( 3 ), the bank is required to refund a negative balance within 7 days of my request, and only by "" cash, check, or money order, or credit to a deposit account of the consumer ''. None of these methods of refund were utilized by Wells Fargo.

The longer version of the story is as follows : In XXXX I was assigned XXXX XXXX as my loan servicing company upon graduation from XXXX school at XXXX  XXXX University. At the time I graduated I had a combined balance of roughly {$110000.00} with about 20 different subsidized and unsubsidized loans. 

I decided that consolidation and income based repayment would be a good option for me, so I consolidated my loans with a 5 % interest rate with a 20-25 year forgiveness plan. The payment plan worked well for me. My payments were roughly {$100.00} a month and I have made the payments on time every month. Fast forward 3 1/2 years after graduation and I have saved up enough money to put a down payment on a home! 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX my boyfriend and I met with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX Montana. We had our credit reports pulled to find that my student loans were negatively impacting my credit report. XXXX XXXX was reporting the loan amount of {$110000.00} with a balance of {$120000.00}. 

I was never informed that should my balance grow beyond what was consolidated that it would report negatively. Together with the help of our Loan Officer this XX/XX/XXXX, we called XXXX   XXXX XXXX to inform them of the reporting error. XXXX  XXXX servicing informed us that they had only started reporting their loans this way in XXXX of XXXX.

Would not give me info acted like a pushy gangster and threaten me over something to this point I know nothing about. He gave me a date from 4 years ago and then proceeded to get mad, loud, pushy, and derogatory towards me.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","IL state law does NOT allow credit reporting agencies to background check beyond 15 years. Nor does it allow reporting on offenses that occurred as a minor. 
Yet, www.chekr.com used a felony from 2003, a XXXX year old charge ( as a minor ) to bar me from employment, causing me to incur an indigent status. I AM XXXX living with family due to improper reporting. They EMBELLISH charges on your rap sheet without actually looking into each offense, to your prospective employer. I.E. If you pled no contest to say, a graffitti charge, vandalism, or any kind of damaging property charges, and you are trying to work for XXXX, they will report that graffiti charge to the Nth degree, even though, what could you vandalize while working out of your own car? Kinda like they don't want ANY criminals ( even the pettiest offender ) being hired EVER, forcing them BACK into a life of crime. 

Atop of that they are absolutely foul in their manners. A dispute to their reporting is almost disrespectful to them. I have never heard anyone get anything reversed from dispute. Pretty much, even if they do reverse the wrong info, the jobs already gone since it takes weeks for this trash entity to act."

Credit card or prepaid card,"My husband already submitted one request last night with my account as a joint claim. After speaking with the credit card company, my husband 's claim was reopened with the credit card company but mine was not. we had charges placed onto credit cards that we had no idea that we were getting. I ended up getting my own account after signing as a joint applicant on this generic/blanket credit application under my husband. I assume the vacation club took my information from the papet and put it into a separate application. I have a charge of {$2200.00} on my card. like my husband stated, we did sign a membership contact which is now cancelled and this has nothing to do with us authorizing this vacation club to take money off of credit cards that we didnt know about. we NEVER signed a receipt or verbally authorize this vacation club to take money from these credit cards. There were no services or Supplies rendered. we also let the vacation club keep {$1000.00} dollars from our bank account during this cancellation. It would not be right for them to keep the {$2200.00} from my card and {$4500.00} from my husband 's card after illegally taking the money. The credit card company sided with vacation club after they showed them we signed a contract for a membership with them and failed to cancel during the 3 day cancellation policy. yes, we failed to cancel with them after being toyed around for a year with lies about not being able to cancel. at the end of the day, this vacation club contact has nothing to do with us authorizing this company to take {$6700.00} dollars from us without our consent."

Debt collection,"In XX/XX/XXXX I consolidated my student loans. Navient became the my creditor. First off they said I received a $ XXXXXXXX refund after the consolidation, which I never received or even heard about. 

When I originally had my loans consolidated by the XXXX XXXX XXXX they were $ XXXXXXXX ( approx. ) When I began making payments to Navient, my loans were suddenly over {$80000.00} ( approx ). I have been paying on these loans since XX/XX/XXXX monthly and they haven't decreased at all. 

I called Navient to find out how I could address my student loan debt as my principle amount continued to increase despite payments recommended by Navient. I asked about loan forgiveness because I worked for a non-profit drug and alcohol treatment program as a counselor for many years. I was told that Navient did not offer loan forgiveness. I asked the young woman if there was someone else I could speak to about my options and she told me she was the supervisor and she wished she could help me, she understood my frustration because she had student loans herself she had to pay back. There was nothing they could do for me. I said how can my loans be increasing if I am paying the interest plus principle ( approx $ XXXX. ). She said she didn't know. 

Several months later I called again as I had resigned from my position and was on unemployment. Navient instructed me to get a forbearance on my loans. I did so until I was off unemployment and employed again. They suggested I 2xs that I do an interest only re-payment plan. 


I believe Navient manipulated my ignorance and did not guide me well with repayment options. I believed that Navient misguided me into a forbearance as well as an interest only payment to profit from my ignorance. I further believe that Navient either recorded a refund that they never sent me or that this refund as a result of my loan consolidation was fabricated for their benefit. Finally I believe that Navient hires debt counselors that are not qualified to advise students about their debts to Navient. Taking advantage of students for profit is wrong.

Mortgage,"After receiving notice that my complaint about the amount of money due was substantiated I received a report of my mortgage and had more questions regarding the report. I emailed 2 separate departments at the mortgage company and got 2 different letters stating they were looking into this but have been waiting over 5 months.

They received an overpayment from me which they have sitting in escrow and they have given no credit to an entire payment which had been made on my behalf by a local charity. 
As of right now they are stating that I am 7 months behind and I also have questions about my report which still go unanswered. 
Did they ever apply my bankruptcy to my account? Why do I have so much "" Unapplied '' funds, why have there continued to be legal fees added to m y account even during times of payment on the loan, and others?

Checking or savings account,"Dear XXXX, US Bank uses overdrafts in every way it can to charge their customers. They charge their customers excessively in order to add to their earnings per share. 

The following is my experience. I would not have received this kind of customer service at my other bank. 

I made several purchase from XXXX for the first time. I went to the bank to deposit an additional amount of money to account for the purchases. 

I was unware XXXX debited the account after hours for a purchase I believed I accounted for during reconciliation. 

U.S Bank normally debits the account immediately. XXXX debited the account after business hours and I was unable to deposit additional funds. I was unaware of this until I logged in. 

When I logged in, I saw an overdraft of {$36.00}. I called in to customer service to explain the situation and expected the {$36.00} to be refunded. 

I spoke to 'XXXX ID # XXXX. She put me on hold for several minutes. This was a simple housekeeping error. XXXX did not provide the 5 star customer service the bank advertises. After about 5 minutes, she stated she is unable to waive the fee. 

I was very unhappy and dissatisfied with the length of time it took for this minor housekeeping issue. I asked for her ID # and she would not provide it to me. I asked several times and she did not respond. 

I asked for a manager which took about another 5 minutes. XXXX ID # XXXX a a manager took over. She was unable to provide the 5 star customer service and stated she would not refund the {$36.00}. 

This bank chargers overdrafts in a manner that is excessive. This needs to be reviewed. They use the overdrafts as a way add to the earnings per share. 

This call I initiated should have been 5 minutes. Instead, US bank and its management use these situations to penalize their hard working customers. It is a very poor customer service tactic. 

US Bank does not care that I am a very dissatisfied regarding this conclusion. They are happy to charge me {$36.00}. 

I will be closing my accounts and using my other banking relationships. 

I will be relaying this experience to my attorney who will send a letter in order to get this on the record."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX ask us to update our information in their system on XX/XX/XXXX, because we are an owner of the timeshare and they told us that the company has a new system. So since we did not accept our tablet last XX/XX/XXXX and the welcome package they sent us, they will contact the main office if they can reinstate the expired offer. They asked our ID and SSN to verify our account and ask us to sign that they authorize us to look at our account in the system but they never informed us that they will run our credit. I just found out because I have XXXX  XXXX  who monitors our credit scores."
Mortgage,"Planet Home Lending LLC ( PHL ), located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CT XXXX, has consistently and inaccurately represented payment history ; knowing they failed to provide necessary notifications and despite repeated attempts to resolve issues regarding inaccuracies. Having no other option, since they will not correct ( or at least provide complete information ), selecting rather to report and maintain inaccuracies, negatively impacting our credit score, we are filing a complaint with the CFPB. 

In or around XX/XX/2018, automatic debits were set up, by us, with PHL, to retrieve mortgage payments. Although PHL sent us confirmation showing that the automatic payment would be debited from our account for our next payment, for whatever reason, they did not retrieve the funds. Upon this realization, we contacted PHL, paid the amount in full, sent them the confirmation regarding the automatic debits, sent to us by them documenting their assertion that the draft was to be taken out. Nonetheless, they reported the payment as late. 

The first CSR we spoke with indicated that the error was indeed theirs and stated that the records would be updated. However, that never occurred. Many subsequent calls later, they eventually stated they needed twenty-five ( 25 ) days to review the records and make an assessment. When we followed up with them, we were told for the first time, that it may have taken up to thirty days for the debit process to initiate- a factor never disclosed to us at any time. We petitioned for them to update our records, since we were never notified about that thirty day window and in fact were informed of quite the opposite, but that only resulted in a report to the credit bureaus.

While we are not arguing that the responsibility remains ours, it is a shady and sloppy company indeed, that receives its payment in full, after improperly informing a consumer of that company 's policy/procedures - one that could have a negative impact on the consumer, a consumer that has been with the company for over a decade, the company is notified of their inaccuracy, but then files that report with the Credit Bureaus anyway. 

In addition, PHL also reported two payments as late in XX/XX/2018 and XX/XX/XXXX- neither was. 

Consumers have very little power against corporations, and rely on them to have sound policies and practices- particularly when those corporations have the awesome responsibility of negatively impacting that consumer for seven years at a stretch. For the most part, many corporations seem to respect that responsibility, while others, like PHL, do not. PHL rather, has abused that power. My experience with them, even beyond this one, has shown them to be sloppy at best and negligent at worst. Further, even though they have a legal duty to correct inaccuracies, they have failed to do so. 

This company 's practices and policies, should they exist, be investigated and they should be fined when they are found lacking."

Checking or savings account,"XX/XX/XXXX I went to local Wells Fargo Bank to setup access for my account to be debited by XXXX   cruise for my trip and my purchases From XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. My balance before starting this trip there was {$1600.00} in my checking and {$1000.00} in savings account On the XX/XX/XXXX my job deposited additional {$150.00}. I left the cruise ship on XX/XX/XXXX and was given a billed for {$1300.00}. I had another trip i was going to after the cruise to Mississippi I had more than enough to cover my balance for the cruise and moved additional {$500.00} for my trip to Mississippi on the XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked my balance and the XXXX XXXX transaction was already taken out and I had {$960.00} in checking and {$520.00} in savings. In Mississippi I took out only {$300.00} out of my checking still leaving {$660.00} in checking and {$520.00} in savings. On XX/XX/XXXX I check my emails and receive an email notice that my funds were below XXXX. So I checked my account online to find my balance as - {$200.00} in checking and that they took the additional funds of {$520.00} out of my savings to cover the overdrafts of purchase from XXXX XXXX after the one billed amount of {$1300.00}.

( As XXXX XXXX   explains they don't do one by one transactions they do one big bill to the bank and give us a copy of the itemize statement for our records ) So I was transferred to a Fraud Specialist to file a claim. XXXX  did not take it my claim very seriously treated like charges were correct. I had to advise him over and over that the cruise line doesn't do the charges like this and I had already paid the charges. Then he states this happens all the time and blame the XXXX merchants for the issue. And to not worry. My checking and savings were depleted he gave me claim # XXXX  and told me "" if '' they were duplicated I would be refunded.

So when I explained the issue to that rep she so empathy and advise that she would send the request again to try to get this issue straighten out. XX/XX/XXXX, I checked my balance today and they are now showing my balance to be {$650.00} in checking and {$0.00} in savings. So I call back to Well Fargo in regards to this issue about my funds in the savings. The reps explains to me these are the funds from both my checking and savings that they can account for. I advised to her I have the statements before this mess and she advised that the may not show my true balances on those statements. I asked if that was the case how where they able to take funds from my savings as overdraft she advised that my account is setup to cover my checking when it is low she still couldn't explain where the money went that they were showing pending. I have not use the card since it was flagged there are no pending charges. She advised that was my balance and they were closing the claim. Only when I advised that I was reporting them to CFPB is when she advised that they were sending me to a Resolution Specialist I was placed on an extended hold for minutes and no one came back on the line. I have copies of the statements before and after this trip as proof I had more money than {$650.00} in my account. I have been ROBBED BY WELLS FARGO!!! I just want the money that had in my account after my last purchase {$660.00} in checking and {$520.00} in my savings back.

Those payments has had to be reported as partial payments and they don't, so my record will show that I haven't made a payment at all what is not true. They are charging me late charges, insurance payments and "" other charges '' not specify and by the way my account will soon summited to a Foreclosure Procedure.

Experian, upon request must send where and whom the reported information originated to prove this reported information is not only valid but also, verified. 

If the information disputed, is still "" unverified '' as defined by the FTCA, procedures for reporting. The disputed information must be investigated, verified as outlined via the FTCA and IF a disputed item can not prove valid, the item, deleted from the credit file. 

The original complaint to the CFBP recorded, XX/XX/2018, went unfulfilled. Since filing a formal complaint with the CFPB, Experian sent letters, titled-notification of dispute, investigation results, and finally, an explanation for the results, with a catch-all summary and consumer rights jargon printed on the trailing pages of the letters mailed. 

Experian 's generic mass produced letters, a waste of time and nothing more. Per the FTCA, the item ( s ) of dispute should no longer appear on Experian 's credit file, yet remain. I request all disputed items be deleted per the FTCA procedures for reporting."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, I was alerted to possible identity theft by receiving a letter in the mail from XXXX XXXX for an account opened on XX/XX/19 with them. After reading the letter, I realized it was financing for a XXXX XXXX purchase. I contacted the XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/19 and informed them of the fraudulent purchase. They contacted XXXX XXXX and I spoke with them while they begin their investigation. This prompted me to freeze my credit report and place a fraud alert with XXXX, Experian, and XXXX which I did successfully. I then pulled my credit reports with them and noticed inquiries that I do not recognize on each of the reports. 

I called the numbers for each of them and they were unable to help me dispute an inquiry, only to dispute an account. I believe I am a victim of identity theft and need help removing these fraudulent inquiries from my report which are detailed in the resolution section of this request."
Debt collection,"*******URGENT******* I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX  office at XXXX at XXXX XX/XX/19 to speak with the representative in charge of my account. When the individual got on the phone he indicated that he was the manager and had been in charge of my account ( reference # XXXX ) since i started making payments a few months ago. Immediately after inquiring about assistance the individual proceeded to tell me that i was not smart for acquiring the debt that i have, passing extreme judgment on the amount i was paying and how the creditor that i acquired the debt with, threatened legal action against me if i modified my payments, yelled at me, spoke over me, refused to transfer my call to another representative, stated that he would not assist me with my concerns, noted to me that customer service was not his job nor his concern amongst several other demeaning and disrespectful comments. It is unfortunate that someone like this is allowed to speak to customers or individuals in my situation that have gone through extreme hardship and tragedy but are making several on time payments to rectify the situation as best as possible. I would like this escalated and action taken against this person. I am available at XXXX and would like to have my account transferred. I have filed several complaints and was denied the ability to speak to his manager during my call."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I've challenged the following accounts on many occasions, however the main 3 credit bureaus, XXXX, Experian, and XXXX all responded by stating accounts verified. Well then the only thing I can request at this time before going to the FCTA, is the Method Of Verification should in order to close my initial dispute .Who did your company speak with, and what was the method of communication, was it phone, fax, email, text, fax, etc. And what was the date, time, and documentation that made you come to your conclusion. The accounts are, XXXX XXXX XXXX, one for {$350.00}, and the other for {$130.00}. Nor do I have an contract with this company..please send me the Method Of Verification inwhich your decision was made."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I filed a complaint with Equifax about inquiries that were on my credit profile. Instead of the company clearing up this matter, they decided to ignore my request to validate the inquiries. They insisted that I had to follow up with the companies because the companies were the ones who placed the inquiries on my account. I told them that I was filing a dispute about their reporting and that it was their responsibility to make sure that the inquiries that they were reporting should be validated on their end. They chose to ignore my request for validation. I followed up with a second letter on XX/XX/XXXX asking them again to validate the inquiries but they chose to not validate the accounts and Instead place a fraud alert on my credit profile instead of doing their jobs and completing the investigation. I am concerned with the validity of these inquires on my credit profile and it represents a serious error in their reporting on my credit profile. Both letters were sent via certified mail and the signature receipts are attached to this as well."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On about XX/XX/2018, I received confirmation from Equifax regarding the removal of the XXXX/XXXX  account from my credit file. However, on about XX/XX/2018, I hired The XXXX XXXX to challenge the items found within my credit file. The XXXX XXXX XXXX stated that when Equifax deleted The XXXX/XXXX  account from my credit file, they failed to also delete the negative history associated with XXXX/XXXX  account from my credit file. Today XX/XX/2018, I spoke again with Equifax. I explained the issue Equifax. 

The representative at Equifax stated they did not receive the dispute regarding XXXX/XXXX until Saturday XX/XX/2018. Based on their response, I contacted The XXXX XXXX XXXX again. I presented the response I got from Equifax. The XXXX XXXX XXXX has indicated that they electronically submitted the dispute on XX/XX/2018. That means Equifax has had this dispute for more than a few weeks now. XXXX XXXX stated that Equifax would have received the dispute almost instantaneously on XX/XX/2018. Prior to ending the call with Equifax, The representative further indicated, they must send this information to XXXX and start the process over again. There are a few issues here. 

Equifax should have cleared the deletion of the negative history when they deleted the item. Today, an Equifax member provided me with information that conflicts what the XXXX XXXX XXXX has stated. Also, both XXXX  and XXXX  where both able to resolve get everything done correctly the first time, so Why didn't Equifax? I'm in the process trying to purchase a home. The time that Equifax is taking to get this right creates issues for me such as more money in terms of down payment, higher interest rates, and or could be reducing that amount I can qualify for when buying my home. This needs to get fixed!"
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo started the 6 years of horror for a Home Modification, which I fell victim to Wells Fargo Scam or Glitch? Lost my home of twenty years XX/XX/XXXX. Spent all my money on attorneys to desperately save my home. I did everything W. F. ask for in a quick and timely manner, it was a vicious circle. I always felt uneasy, scared, desperate, sleepless nights, weight loss, could not eat. W.F. was less than kind or sympathetic. Wells Fargo attorney actually called me a Liar and a Thief and stated it was the end of the road for me ( homeowner ) and the time in my home was over. Very Very unprofessional, heartless to say the least. Already filed a complaint about Wells Fargo. I want to be heard and not for gotten. Wells Fargo owes me and many others a home or the equivelent amount of money our homes were worth at the time W.F. foreclosed on us."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Midwest Recovery Systems at XXXX is reporting on a settled debt on my account and demanded XXXX to stop reporting on it and they do not own this debt. The debt was sold from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX and they have also tried reaching out to Midwest recovery systems telling them they should not be reporting and this account has been settled in full. Midwest told me they would not remove reporting of this debt they do not own unless I give them 1600+ dollars.
Checking or savings account,"my bank account was debited without my authorization on the XX/XX/XXXX for the purchase of a subscription to an XXXX XXXX  site. This purchase was made by a XXXX year old boy whom had gotten my card information. When I discovered the transactions I immediately went to my bank account on line and froze my account which should have locked my account disabling any transactions. This was the XX/XX/XXXX. I then tried to contact my bank and contest these unauthorized charges and reporting the company responsible. Well, I guess because of this pandemic we are having, I was not able to speak to anyone but I thought I was safe because I had frozen my account. On the XX/XX/XXXX the monies were still on hold status and normally they stay on hold status for 10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX we went to the store and my card was declined so I got back on my banking account and the three debits to my account had all been paid, that is in a matter of two days which is sooner than normal and I had my account frozen. I am a XXXX year old man who lives on a fixed income and I am pretty much ignorant when it comes to technology, let me just say if this technology is costing us our humanity, is it really worth it?"
Debt collection,"Hi, upon checking my credit files I saw I have a collection account with Transworld Systems Inc and it said the original creditor was XXXX XXXX, I reached out to all 3 credit bureaus ( certifiedd returned receipt ) and asked them for any documents they have on my file with this company, they sent me a letter saying that this account was verified as accurate by the collection company and to reached Transworld Sysytems Inc if I wanted more information. On XX/XX/2019 I sent them a certified letter asking them for any documents or bearing my signature or any contract to see if someone stole my identity or what because I have not NEVER in my life opened any account whatsoever with XXXX XXXX or this company, they have not answered any letter and keep on reporting this negative account to the credit bureaus damaging my credit file. I want to buy a home in the coming months and when I went to check my file this is what I found, now I have to litigate this knowing I have never opened any type of utility service with them or any company before. They never sent me any letter NEVER saying that I had a collection account with them nor to dispute this on 3o days, nothing at all. I want this deleted from all my credit files please. attached is the letter that i sent them."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I have 16 payday / installment loans. I live in the state of Illinois. I was not aware that, by law, I should not have been allowed to have more than three & that they should not total more than 22.5% of my income. Why 16 loans?  Because I was constantly trying to catch up one loan with another, thinking that once I brought the one down, I would be able to take care of the new one. Well one led to another and then another, all at astronomical expenses to my wallet. I recently found my checking account in the negative, because I just plain and simply could no longer handle the juggling act. I need help. I didn’t even realize that I had 16 loans, until I really began trying to get to the bottom of my financial crisis. Is this legal for companies to continually extend loans to me, without verifying whether or not I was at the maximum loan amounts for the state of Illinois? How can I get all of this debt off of my back?My Cash XXXX loan # XXXX  was initially for XXXX. I currently owe more towards the principal, than what I took in the initial loan. How is this so? My interest rate is 674% on XXXX? This feels like being kicked in the teeth, after being awakened from a very bad dream! This is not reality, for 674% interest is a long way from realistic! This is robbery!Is there help out there for my situation?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I initiated on XX/XX/XXXX a credit line increase with XXXX XXXX, which was approved THAT VERY DAY. No hard inquiries at all. ( I have had increases in the past without issues. It has always been a soft pull. ) On XX/XX/XXXX, credit line increase from XXXX XXXX is reported to the CRA and shows on my report. All is well. I am happy. 

Comes XX/XX/XXXX, the CRA reports that on XX/XX/XXXX is when the inquiry was made and XXXX XXXX  requested to see my report. XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX. 

As I have been a victim of identity theft, I panic and contacted XXXX XXXX   fraud department and a gentleman tells me that its the order of business for the company and most companies to do hard pulls for CLI. They just sent the request to the CRA to pull my credit for something that happened 3 weeks before. 

I told him that sounds weird to me that XXXX XXXX would do a pull after the fact, 3 weeks later. I told him that was wrong and I want the hard inquiry removed. Besides, it was a mere {$500.00}, so they can take that back to and I will report to all the forums how XXXX treats its customers and customer information. 

I am very disapointed in XXXX. Anyhow, see below the alert From Experian on XX/XX/XXXX and then on XX/XX/XXXX. The pull was made 3 weeks after the fact!

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I've been trying to resolve the multiple hard inquires on my credit report that I did not authorize. Ive recently put a freeze on all 3 credit reports because my information has been used to apply for auto loans, cash loans, credit cards, etc without my consent. The Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, Experian, XXXX  ) are neglecting to address and verify the inquires properly. Ive tried contacting the creditors and they all informed to me directly dispute with the credit bureaus however they are not willing to work with me. The representatives have been very rude and some have even hung up on me. This has been an extremely stressful experience and I just really want this resolved."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I had a couple of security issues surrounding the house I've lived in for over 25 years recently. So I decided to get security cameras. I had a email from this company so I responded and spoke to a lady who quoted me a price of XXXX dollars for this system. It included so I thought the front and back door camera 's. After the installation they gave you 3 days to cancel, but there was no reason to cancel it was working well. Then I finally got the bill about 30 days later and it was for over 800.00. I was floored. When I called the company they told me that some one would get back to me, no one ever did. The finance company said they went on what XXXX told them and they submitted 800+. When I spoke to someone at XXXX he stated XXXX was for the kit which I thought I was getting, but that I had an extra camera added. The front door camera. I explained to the that this was not within my budget and no one every told be anything about an extra camera I had to pay for or I would have told them to forget it. He told me that I would have to speak to someone in management who would listen to the initial call to see what was said. No one ever contacted me back so I called again. This time I spoke to a very rude lady. I explained that at the time of the sale, I asked the sales person what was better about her company and why I should go with them instead of another company that didn't require any out of pocket for cameras or installation. She was just a very nice person who seemed to be very concerned about my safety, that's how they got me. She told me they had better cameras and she was very comforting. I thought she was trying to help me, I was so concerned about what was going on around my house, that was really all I could think of. The only money this lady spoke of was XXXX. She never told me anything about 800+ dollars, she did say I would get a free camera. I feel like I was baited and switched. When I called again they told me that someone would get back to me with the voice recording of the sales pitch, but no one ever has. They are billing me XXXX a month for this 800.00+ for this equipment. I called today to get the pay off balance and to see where to send the check and they told me there is no place to send the check you have to do it on line. That was it for me. I'm not going to pay them XXXX a month for the rest of my life for this XXXX equipment I'll pay them off, but I just want to know has anybody else had this experience with this company and what if anything can I do. 

Thank You XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Maryland XXXX XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My credit report was pulled multiple times by my previous loan officer- XXXX  XXXX without my consent. I initially gave consent the first time she pulled my report. After that, she continuously pulled my report without notifying me or asking if she could. When I discovered she had done this around XXXX times, I confronted her. She said she would ask for the credit pulls to be revoked. That was in XX/XX/2020. It has been 4 months and none of the credit pulls that followed the first pull have been removed from my report. This is a gross misuse of my personal information and credit report! I should not have to be worried about my own lender sabotaging my credit. 
Furthermore, I would like to report immoral business practices. I was originally contacted by XXXX, she said she was with my companys retention department and that I qualified for a lower interest rate. She did not disclose that I would have to PAY to qualify for a lower rate! Instead she waited until it was time to sign papers and I saw an exorbitant amount of fees being charged for points. When I approached her about this, she verbally abused and manipulated me saying how hard she had worked on my loan and that she isnt an hourly employee, etc etc. not only did she wait until this time to disclose this, it is my opinion that she also had me pay for my appraisal out of pocket in order to make me feel financially obligated to carry through this refi, as I was never given paperwork before the appraisal to go over the fees and costs to get the loan. 
Overall I was partially scammed XXXX {$750.00} for the appraisal ) and my credit report was also misused. 
Now, I have my loan in deferment and can not access my account. Their mobile app has not worked in weeks and their website just had me set up a secondary authentication with my phone number. When trying to log in after this, I would initiate the authentication text but it never comes to my phone! I am now locked out of my account. 
I was given paperwork with an email for the deferment department. I have tried to email it several times and it comes back that the server rejected the email or that the address can not be found! 
It does not seem like this company cares about its people and it does not seem like they are set up to actually help customers while in deferment!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX as the lender never sent me any billing statement, nor payment alert, nor payment book, nor notice if there's any overdue. Yet they report I had 1 late payment for no more than 2 weeks. 

How can they expect customers to pay when they don't send customers billing statements? 

I still don't know my loan number, I have not seen my billing statement, and I have not seen the due date at all. 

It is not right for XXXX to file such claim to damage my credit, given I had 28 years of excellent credit history with no late or missed payment and my credit score was XXXX. Now it dropped to XXXX because of XXXX XXXX false claim. 

In addition, credit bureau does not inform me when they dropped my score drastically for a single late payment that was not even my fault. Credit bureau did not investigate at all, they merely report what lender says. But when the lender is a bad lender such as XXXX, then consumers like me are not protected. We are being bullied by big businesses such as XXXX and credit bureaus."
Checking or savings account,"BOA charges fees for their own personal gain. I had a small balance in my checking account after I went into the banking center to purchase a cashiers check with the funds I had in my checking account. The small balance was enough to leave in my account until my next payroll deposit. By the next business day I get an email from BOA stating that my account was overdrawn. I have a membership with XXXX XXXX and XXXX. Both will bill me monthly via my debit card. Both charges should have been declined via my debit card since there was not enough to cover the charges. So what BOA did was allowed both charges to go through, and they charged my account nsf fees and then they charged me extended overdrawn fees as well. I called BOA spoke to a supervisor who told me it was perfectly legal and if I did not like it I could file a complaint and I could take my business to another bank ... .when I asked for them to send me this in writing they told me that they do not have to, but if I want to I could XXXX it. She also told me that supervisors calls are not recorded. I would like to start a class action law suit ... .please assist me with who do I need to contact to do so ... ..I also want assistance in getting the fees reversed on my account. Please help me. BOA should not be allowed to treat their customers this way"
Vehicle loan or lease,In XX/XX/XXXX I was put on XXXX and I had called in XXXX to see if Ford would be able to lower my car payment due to the financial Hardship that was occurring. Ford transferred me to the rewrite department where I spoke to XXXX and she started the process once the process was complete I was approved on XXXX XXXX. I had called XXXX in the rewrite department to discuss XXXX payment how I didn't want it to be 30 days late during this whole rewrite process and go on my credit. XXXX and XXXX assured me if this happened during the rewrite they would fix the 30 day late payment.Well on XX/XX/XXXX I received an alert stating I was 30 day late on my payment with Ford. I disputed that and called the rewrite department and spoke to a XXXX XXXX who then stated the credit department was in charge of that she then gave me a number where to call XXXX. I called the credit department who informed me the credit was already updated on XX/XX/XXXX that was not the case yesterday the credit bureau contacted me stating the dispute i had made was accurate through Ford and they would not delete the days late which cause my student loan to deny me to not enter school. This has been such a devastation and I hold Ford responsible for this I have been given the run around and they have not owned up to what they said they would do. I have spoken to several Account specialist in different departments and XXXX in customer service informed me today that I would have to send a letter to the Credit Dispute dept to see if they would take the 30 day late payment off. If i knew this would happen I would never have did the rewrite that caused me my career.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I've been overseas for 9 months and was not appealing for any credit. Fraud alerts have been placed with all bureaus.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Capital One has reported an account delinquency on a paid off account. I owe no balance on the account since XX/XX/18. They originally ove rcredited the account giving me a surplus balance which was intended for another credit card, same company. Both numbers were listed on the check and both payment slips were included to correctly identify the amounts. 
On XX/XX/18 I realized they had made a mistake and called to have it corrected. The Capital One employee backed out the payment and once again credited the incorrect account. On XX/XX/18 I owed nothing in XXXX they reported a 30 day overdue payment for the original amount {$57.00} plus XXXX in interest. I have had this happen with Capital One over a 13 year relationship a number of times and so am currently calling in my payments separately for each account but they charge additional fees for that. 
On XX/XX/18, I called and they rectified and backdated the payment to reflect ALL 3 errors on the part of Capital One, and are sending me a letter with the specifics in the meantime I have a delinquency on my credit report and my score dropped about 20 points which could change my interest rates in other credit cards."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Good Morning- My credit score with XXXX is much lower than with XXXX . After doing some digging, I found that XXXX is reporting the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as Open-Derogatory ... .Chapter XXXX Wage Earner Plan Account. This is incorrect. When I filed Chapter XXXX, I filed alone. My ex-husband was not involved. The car was never included in the Chapter XXXX. The car was signed over to my ex-husband. Therefore, he is responsible for the car and is making payments on time."
Debt collection,"ARA has called me numerous times harrassing me about an alleged debt they claim dates back to XX/XX/XXXX. They are hostile and rude and have hung up on me each time I ask for more information. During one instance, the person informed me that they already have a judgment against me for the alleged debt. Shocked to hear this, I asked to speak to the attorney and for the attorney 's information she said "" I will note that you refuse to cooperate '' and then hung up on me. 

Another person, XXXX XXXX with ARA called again today XX/XX/XXXX and told a different story. she said that they have "" requested '' a petition for judgment. I asked for details and to speak with the attorney and she refused. She told me she would let me speak with the paralegal, XXXX XXXX. After being placed on hold, XXXX XXXX rudely said she was the account manager and she was XXXX XXXX ' boss. She asked me "" what did I want. '' This is odd considering they called me and that XXXX XXXX is supposedly a paralegal and should report to the attorney not to an account manager. When I asked to speak with the attorney, for the attorney 's phone number, and for his bar number, she sarcastically said "" his bar number? Bye '' and proceeded to hang up on me. 

These are only a few examples of the phone calls I continue to recieve. Each time I ask for details I get the run around and then they hang up on me."
Mortgage,"My partner and I have lived in our home in XXXX XXXX, MD for over 22 years. Because we are both in XXXX XXXX  and work on commission, our incomes always fluctuate. So many times during those years we have gotten behind, but we would send what we could until we could fully catch up. And always the mortgage servicing company accepted those payments, whatever they were ( see attached ). And that has been true of Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. ( SPS ), our current servicer. 

However, on or about XXXX XX/XX/2018, I sent SPS a check for {$4000.00}, which SPS returned on XXXX XX/XX/2018 ( see attached ). SPS rejected the payment and in its unsigned letter said it would only accept over {$17000.00}. More recently, SPS returned a payment of {$18000.00}. 

As I noted above, our incomes fluctuate regularly and the markets have been slow for us the past year or more. We are doing the best we can, and SPS is just trying to force us out of our home, even though it has in the past taken payments less than the full amount owed. How can a mortgage servicer, which is supposed to work to get money to pay down a debt, reject significant payments? I feel that something has changed to propel SPS to treat me in a different manner than previously and that the company 's motivation is suspect and possibly discriminatory and thus not legal."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I was at the Old Navy store located in XXXX CA. I told the employee that I want to use my GAP credit card and I do not have my card, so she can look me up and use my rewards too- that is what I do when I do not have my card on me. 
She asked me if my card has a chip, and I replied that I do not recall. She told me that I can request a card with a chip and I will get promotional discounts. It seemed fair and I was happy. She had me enter my SS, which I always do if I do not have my card, and after a few minutes, she handed me my receipt and told me that I got all the discounts and I will get my card in the mail soon. 
I have received an OLD NAVY credit card!!!!! I never wanted to open a card with the store. I already have my GAP card, why would I open another store credit card? 
My credit score has been affected by opening that card while I was trying to work on my credit to get a new job. 
I called the company ( OLD NAVY ) and explained the situation and the representative was very nonchalant and did not show any sympathy towards my case. I was very upset and asked him to close my account and that what he did without an apology, although he totally advised me to pay my balance! 
I felt manipulated and misled. I am complaining because I am very concern about my credit and very responsible the way I use it.

Mortgage,"I have tried for several years to refinance my mortgage loan with PHH. There is an average wait time of 10 mins to get an actual person on the line. Then the after repeatedly being put on hold, I would usually just hang up after 30 mins. There is ALWAYS a "" greater than average hold time because of increased volume ''. How can that be? No matter what the time of day! 
So finally I refinanced away. I'm in NY state, so I'm looking to take advantage of XXXX to avoid having to re-pay mortgage tax. Thus I simply need to have PHH assign the mortgage to the new lender so they can file a XXXX and associated fees. 
My new bank 's attorney has done hundreds of these, and tells me PHH is the only firm that can not seem to understand this process. They need an attorney contact to work with and the process handled quickly. The attorney was first told that the client needs to request. I've now had three 35mins+ phonecalls where I'm repeatedly put on hold and they clearly have no idea what an assignment is, nor what XXXX is ( fyi you can XXXX  it ).

I do not owe that money to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX, that is my husbands debt and I want it removed off my end of collections."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hi, I have recently found out through my credit report that XXXX XXXX, a loan service company that works directly with XXXX University, has filed multiple reports against my credit, because of delinquent payments. But on the report it doesn't state why my payments were delinquent. I am always on top of my loan and debt repayments ; however, XXXX is an unreliable company which makes repayments almost impossible. My loans first became due on XX/XX/XXXX. Since that day until XXXX of XXXX, I made several attempts to repay my loans by either visiting their website or calling them. Whenever I visited XXXX 's website I encountered a message claiming that "" service is unavailable ''. This happened every single time I visited their website. Since, repayments through website was obviously not a solution, I attempted calling the company on various days at various times. I would either receive a busy tone, or the call would keep ringing without anyone ever responding. To investigate this further, I called XXXX University 's loan and financial department, and a represintive went over different possibilities. They told me that XXXX often has these problems, and it is very like that they are changing the service provider for those loans, and I shouldn't worry about. That was a relief to hear as XXXX seemed very shady in the way they conducted business. Unavailable website and customer service can be very very alarming. This company has wasted a lot of my time from writing this complaint, calling them, visiting their website, etc. I shouldn't chase after them and waste every day of my life to hopefully catch their uptime. This is unreasonable. 

On XXXX of XXXX, I was able to access their website, and realized they are still handling my loan. Their website 's interface is not intuitive and errs on the simplest actions and inputs. Even with all these obstacles, the first thing I did was to setup ACH so that they could directly transfer money from my bank account. Again, this was the first thing that I did to prevent any delinquent repayments in the future. I believe the way that XXXX handled my case is absolutely wrong and bizarre, since they provided no medium for me to take care of my repayments at all. XXXX 's business is very concerning and suspicious. No transparent communications, no website, and no customer service. Even as I am writing this the website is unavailable. However, this time it doesn't even show any messages, the website just doesn't load at all. I have tried to load the website in different browsers and still no luck. I have attached the picture of one of the instances when I visited the company 's website to make a payment. This problem was so frequent, I took a screenshot. In case something like this would ever happen. I am glad I did."

I called the same day requesting my dispute be reopened for review for alleged fraud. XXXX XXXX notified me on XX/XX/XXXX of delinquent Citibank credit card report sent to XXXX. I had not yet been billed for this charge since my dispute was closed. I called Citibank XX/XX/XXXX and was told my dispute was not reopened for review on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked when I will received a statement, and they said they mailed one on XX/XX/XXXX. I informed them they reported a delinquent charge illegally. They said I should write their Credit Bureau Dispute Dept. with a copy of the XXXX  report.

Mortgage,"I purchased and closed on a condo on XX/XX/2016. I obtained my financing thru XXXX XXXX who was at that time working for XXXX. I 've attached his current contact info. XXXX never informed me that XXXX was being purchased by Chemical Bank, which purchase was in the news 2 weeks later. He sent me an email the day he left XXXX to go to XXXX XXXX Bank informing me of his move and that he was very upset with Chemical Bank. I believe, along with a couple of other Realtors who have done business with him, that he may have deliberately not passed along the appropriate info to spite them. That being said, I know that it 's ultimately the bank 's job to get things done correctly and legally. XXXX told me I was getting a conventional portfolio loan for the condo purchase ( {$110000.00} purchase price ) with a {$23000.00} XXXX Homestyle Construction Loan ( on PA ) attached for renovation. I had to go thru a ton of hoops to get my financing but finally got the clear to close a month after the original contracted date. We closed on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX with a closing agent who had not previously seen nor done any work on my file so she was flustered making me the same. The contractor who was going to do the interior work on my condo was at the closing as well but he was not asked by XXXX to sign the Construction Indemnity Agreement which has created a ton of duress since he made a mess of my condo, left the job XX/XX/XXXX, refused to the lien waivers needed to receive payment and has filed a Notice Of Lis Pendens XX/XX/XXXX. Although the Construction Contract I signed states that I am the contractor, Chemical Bank has refused to give me any draws from my construction loan leaving me in financial squeeze play. Although the only person in Chemical Bank 's entire staff who I 've been told repeatedly has any say regarding my construction rider, XXXX XXXX, says he refuses to disburse any of my money has been saying it 's due to the contractor, I believe it 's actually due my {$23000.00} having been stolen/laundered or vanished by some other means or person. I 've repeatedly asked both the XXXX and XXXX where the money is/for accounting or deposit records but they both refuse to give them or any other info. I 've attached the Closing Disclosure, XXXX Settlement Statement and most recent Chemical Bank statement. I do n't have a GFE and XXXX XXXX claims he does n't have access to it. The CD and XXXX do n't match up. They have different purchase prices, {$110000.00} and {$140000.00}. XXXX has a construction holdback. The CD does not. Another title company said a Commencement of Construction should have been recorded but was not. There is not a broker statement in my package either. XXXX XXXX, my broker until last Friday, has financial interest in XXXX.. When I started asking questions about all of this mess, XXXX deactivated my business email account along with other necessary computer/electronic signing capabilities, thus hiding evidence of all the work I did to try getting this figured out and resolved, along with making it impossible for me to work. All of my business contacts and their info was in the programs. I sure am hoping you can help! Thanks in advance."
Debt collection,"I have been a victim of identity theft since 2015. The initial symptoms were paying my bills using XXXX bill pay and creditors notifying me that the bill was not paid via collection notices. I do not know how secure the bill pay site is. I may have paid the bills twice in error without looking at my bank statements but there needs to be an audit and consumers may need to be reimbursed. My money kept disappearing without explanation numerous of times. I would look at my bank statements but could not find where it was disappearing. I then received several bill collectors harassing me via phone and then letters in error. See attach XXXX XXXX XXXX as an example. Secondly, someone opened at second telephone line without my consent which means they were pretending to be me. This became a habit. As soon as I opened an account then they would modify it, clone it, etc which made it harder to catch them. If they opened new accounts under my name I may have caught them sooner but they never did. I then notified XXXX XXXX XXXX fraud to report the outstanding balance of {$500.00} on their website but I never received a call back or letter. My bill is usually {$100.00} per month. This complaint was never investigated and I never received my money back. Initially I thought it could be a billing error which has happened in the past and was fixed immediately. XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to resolve this so I closed immediately in person and I paid {$250.00} the rest of payments were maid monthly. After XXXX XXXX XXXX was paid {$500.00} then I get a collection letter stating I owe them money because I never paid my owed balance. I notified the credit bureaus in writing telling them I paid XXXX XXXX XXXX  {$500.00} ; I am not going to give them an additional {$250.00} but they did not take me seriously and the dispute lasted over three years on my credit report. And then it is finally removed when I furnish my bank statements. There was no investigation from the credit bureaus it was just my letter sent to the creditor. When another creditor complained XXXX XXXX of the same issue they closed my credit card account in error. There was no debt owed but my account was closed. I was never late. I would have to gather my bank records from XXXX and audit them and forward to XXXX XXXX as they are claiming I was late on payments. I decided to switch banks in hopes to resolve future issues with creditors but keep XXXX open for disputing purposes only which was a mistake. I should have closed it immediately but I was unaware of this critical knowledge at that time. I did not know how to report a bank I was having issues with. I still had to pay a loan to XXXX and used XXXX bill pay to transfer my funds to XXXX. At the XXXX bank I was notified of fraud transactions. I was aware that I was having fraud transactions at XXXX because there was insufficient funds to pay bills numerous of times which isn't normal for me. XXXX told me it was a card skimmer and to get a new card which would resolve the issue. I have had numerous of debit cards replaced at XXXX ; I knew this wasn't going to resolve the issue but didn't know what else to do at that time. I got a new card at XXXX but it did not resolve the issue. Someone had collected my personal information and was cloning my credit and debit cards to use my funds without my acknowledgement or approval. I asked the bank how did you catch them because I was unable to? They stated that everything is time stamped and it was impossible for XXXX people to shop simultaneously at far and different locations. Later I called inquiry to close my account because of identity theft. The bank gave me an identity theft brochure which stated to contact FTC. I then closed XXXX bank account permanently and closed XXXX account to avoid fraud transactions in the future. On FTC website I learned there that I was an XXXX XXXX breach victim. XXXX or FTC should always notify victims of the data breach to avoid grave damage to credit report. I was not notified by any party. I had to investigate myself. I opened a credit monitoring account. And got notifications that someone is posting my personal information on the dark web including my email address and phone number. I then contacted the local police and FBI. A year later they are still unable to find the perpetrator. I recently got an apple alert on my iphone that someone from XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to log in as me. I then realize that once your information is posted on the dark web anyone can see it worldwide. Therefore law enforcement agencies would not have jurisdiction and no one would be held accountable. I submitted evidence to the credit bureaus asking to clear my name on my credit report due to fraud and identity theft. A letter was sent to the creditors on behalf of credit bureau using the language, "" if the account was opened as a result of identity theft, ... '' the account was opened by me that is not the issue. The language should have stated that my accounts were compromised due to identity theft. As a result, the accounts weren't considered fraud so the issue remains unresolved. This is fraud because someone gained my personal information and cloned my credit cards. They tarnished my credit reputation, impersonated me, and made fraud transactions. As this remains unresolved I am having issues with housing, renting a car due to catastrophe and they require a credit check or credit card which I don't have."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",recently reviewed my credit report and noticed I have a inquiry from this company I did not authorize them to do so I have reached put numerous times to resolve.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Freedom Debt RElief has taken over {$4000.00} from me - charged me over {$2000.00} in fees. They also kept changing my withdrawal dates without telling me causing NSF fees to post to my account and make me go negative. They were not clear on what I was getting into. I had to fight to get them to cancel my program ( asked for months ) and only then did I see the outrageous fees.
Debt collection,I am currently working with Immediate credit recovery to resolve a student loan of about {$2000.00}. We have worked out a payment plan that I have agreed to as them and signed off on. And stated making payments on. Today at about XXXX on XX/XX/19 they called the XXXX and to my XXXX. From XXXX The secretary did transfer to my work phone ( she didn't know any better ). I tolled them not to call me at work. I am a XXXX  and work at a XXXX. A miss XXXX XXXX was the rep from ICR.  She initially presented her self as security or something like that We talked for a few minutes about the loan and that I and making payments on this. We have scheduled payments of {$15.00} to come out of my bank account on the XXXX of every month to start rehabbing this loan. I did remind her about me not wanting to be called at work. Her tone was harassing and threating. I did inform her that I would be making a complaint that it was illegal to call someone at work if they said not to.
Mortgage,"In XX/XX/2020, I submitted a refinance application with my existing mortgage lender, Flagstar financial. I have an excellent credit score, no financial hardships, solid employment history and was not requesting any cash out. It was a simple refi to change the rate from a 30 year@ 5.25 % to a 20 year@ 2.875 %. Over the past 5 months Flagstar has conditionally approved the application package multiple times only to request additional disclosure statements regarding any changes to bank account balances between XXXX through XXXX, multiple credit reports XXXX through XXXX and most recently a signed explanation statement regarding inquiries of competing lenders on my credit report last week. 
The latest reason for Flagstar 's two week delay is because I attempted to research competing lenders who were interested in refinancing my loan for to the extensive and unnecessary delays created by flagstar. Once I informed flagstar of this action they responded that closing should take place within a week 's time ; therefore I did not pursue other lenders interest. 
With industry standards being 30-60 days for new applicants to close on a refi, I suspect Flagstar is intentionally delaying the closing of my refinance considering it's in their best interest to keep me paying my current mortgage at a higher rate. Additionally, the have not disclosed how much these delays are costing ( in both interest and term ) me per month. Finally, since XXXX refi rates have increased and competing lenders are not able to match the original lock in rate from XX/XX/2020."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XX/XX/XXXX I had 9 accounts through Nelnet that hit my credit report. Reporting late I had no idea that payments were due because my accounts were in deference status. Usually there is an upcoming date to remind you of payment through email. I did not get reached through email or valid address. I called immediately once I found out and they didnt see that they tried to reach me by email either for a reminder. Instead they went off public records which was incorrect due to me having identity theft in XXXX were someone obtained my information and opened multiple accounts and attached mailing information to a PO Box . Ive contacted Nelnet multiple times to see about getting the late payments removed. Ive even tried to work out payment plan if late payments could be removed. They had no way of contacting me and instead of apologizing for the inconvenience the representative basically said its my problem and it will not be removed. I had no recollection of this being late and it is impacting my credit very negative especially with me being in the process of trying to purchase a home. I can not do anything with 9 accounts showing late and its the same lender very unfair! Especially because they are not offering any type of assistance.
Debt collection,"I have had numerous calls from a lady who claims to be calling from an attorney 's office in an attempt to collect an old credit debt sent off to collections. This started last XXXX, when I spoke with the lady she claimed that I needed to pay {$8000.00} by the end of the day, that the interest had accrued that much. When I got off the phone with her after telling her I would see what I could do, I called Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo told me to go into my Wells Fargo bank. The banker made numerous calls and finally was able to find out that the account was in fact charged off and gave me the name of the company and also the number. After I called XXXX XXXX they informed me that the account had been settled and dismissed with prejudice. This company or whoever they are continue to harass me and have now started calling my current employer. I need this to stop."

On XX/XX/XXXX Best Buy/citibank withdrew {$190.00} in autopay on a paid off, closed account. I called customer support immediately upon seeing this on my banks app. I was told then that it was a mistake and would be refunded within 10 days. 

No refund was completed so I called back, asked to speak to a supervisor and was again told it would be 7-10 days. On the XX/XX/XXXX, I  received an email from Citi that the refund was being processed and should be in my account within 3 days. 

No refund appeared within the timeframe so I called again, they gave me a account number the refund went to which was not mine, nor the account the money had been withdrawn from. After advising them of their inaccuracy and reproviding the correct account number, I asked how and why this could happen, the account had been set up on autopay and the {$190.00} they withdrew was from the same account I had just re provided. Again I was told 7-10 days.

I called again the following week and requested to be transferred to the next level management as every answer was becoming 7-10 days.

Upon reaching the Executive response team, they agreed that they made the mistake both by withdrawing the money to begin with but also for refunding it to "" some other account which was not mine ''. I was told by that team that they had another 7-10 days to review and work on the issue. 

I received a call ( the first callback during this issue ) on the XX/XX/XXXX from the executive response team stating that the only issue left was for her to get verbal confirmation from me that I did not have an account ending in XXXX ( the account they sent the money to ), I confirmed and restate here that I do not have an account ending in those numbers. Her response was that she would rush that confirmation to the "" other office in charge of disbursements '' and to expect the refund in my correct account within 5-7 days. 

Upon yet again not receiving the refund I called today XXXX and again spoke with my executive account specialist ( XXXX ) XXXX, she advised me she had been given bad information and that they also needed to recover the money from the erroneous account prior to paying me back for their error. 

( I would like to reiterate that even today Citi confirms they made a mistake, they know I don't own the account they supposedly sent the money to, that they will not refund their mistake-my money until they get theirs back ). 

During this phone conversation which they record, my specialist also informed me that : 1. She now had a response date/iou to me to get back to me by XXXX. 
2. They/Citi can't/wo n't as a matter of policy refund me until they secure their money first.

3. They have no ability to find anything out about the account they sent it to as they do not know who owns it, nor can the receiving bank give out information without the account owners approval, but she has until the XXXX to get back to me, they sent the receiving bank a letter and "" I hope they can help ''. 

I requested to speak to the next level of management as I simply could not believe a company as large as Citi could do business in such a way. She told me the next level was the office manager but he wouldn't have access to my account. I said that was fine I would still like to speak to him. She then asked me why as he had no account access? I stated he didn't need to have account access, I wanted to ask him about policy. She then informed me that the office manager doesn't speak to customers. I found these actions pretty telling and is what prompted me to contact Consumerfinance.gov.

We are currently on day 58 of this process as of XXXX and the only difference today from XX/XX/XXXX is that instead of the past 7-10 response time promised, Citi has done 2 things, one upped the time frame to 21 days and 2 advised me they won't refund me until they get their money and they have no way to do that. Citi employees words not mine. 


Any help you can provide on this will be greatly appreciated as I see this as fraud on the part of Citibank/Best Buy Credit institution."

We got the paperwork work late from them and than they put a late payment on my credit. We called XXXX XXXX about it and he said that should have not happen and he would take care of it for us. We tried and tried to get this fixed with him and XXXX XXXX also from XXXX XXXX XXXX she was our mortgage officer for the end of the loan when it was to go to a first mortgage on the property. We reach out to XXXX XXXX again after we closed on the mortgage to get this fixed he than at that time said to us that they can not fix it because they have an A rating an it would not look good for them.

Mortgage,"I would like to add to my prior complaint.

COMPLAINT ID XXXX SUBMITTED ON XX/XX/XXXX PRODUCT Mortgage SPS ' response is NOT clear and is contradictory. At the time of mediation, over and over, SPS stated they did NOT do a full review as required by Washington State Law. They tried to blame the fact that I had filed a complaint with WA State Attorney General. However, that complaint was closed on XX/XX/XXXX and the mediation did not happen until XX/XX/XXXX. They had 4 months to do a review. Even had our original date of XX/XX/XXXX been in place they would have had over 30 days to do a full account review, which they require per all notifications on their website and their RMA documents.

They state in their response to my above complaint that INCOME was NOT a factor in their review and they didn't require income. The last income statements they had from myself and my husband are dated back to XX/XX/XXXX. They then state they were unable to offer a repayment plan because we didn't have the right income to debt ratio. However, how is that possible if income was not a factor and which is it? They don't need income or we don't show the right amount available? They continue to state that because of our lack of income they could only offer a 12 month repayment plan and require a balloon payment at the end of 12 months of $ XXXX because their offered repayment plan would not repay the back balance due.They never addressed the reason for keeping our repayment plan at 6 % and not doing what everyone else in the industry seems to be doing by offering repayment at recent rates ( approx. 4.25 % ). They seem to be stating one issue then offering a repayment plan that would set us as the homeowner up for failure.

Nothing in their response addresses the discrepancies in dollar figures. I realize that we have a couple more days prior to their noted time to provide that, but it should have been a point that was mentioned as being worked on."
Credit card or prepaid card,"My Chase XXXX credit card was wrongly flagged for fraudulent activity. The company did not contact me to verify whether or not I had initiated the action, but merely assumed my card/identity had been stolen, and "" permanently closed '' my account on XXXX XX/XX/2019. They did not notify me of this action, nor give me a reason for my account 's closure - I found out when my card had been declined, and I called in to the number on the back of the credit card. I had to spend hours on the phone over 9 weeks, and speak to numerous people, submit multiple pieces of documentation in-branch at XXXX, NY, 2 hours away from my home, and threaten legal action,  before I found out the reason for my account 's closer - it had been wrongly flagged for fraud. They did not give me an opportunity to use the {$700.00} in rewards points I have accrued over the years, nor let me copy any of my credit card statements, as they had locked me out of the online portal and app. I have spent over 20 hours on the phone over the course of over two months, with no resolution.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I purchased a washer and dryer online from the Home Depot website. During the purchase I read that if I open a Home Depot credit card I will receive a {$100.00} credit on my first purchase. I decided to do that and purchased the items for a total of {$1500.00} with a scheduled delivery date of XX/XX/2019. With the promised {$100.00} credit for my first purchase the total should have been adjusted to {$1400.00}. While I was at the local Home Depot in XXXX XXXX, NY on XX/XX/2019 to purchase some unrelated items I decided to look at the washer and dryer floor models I purchased online and noticed that they were selling for {$50.00} each lower than the price I received online. I asked a sales associate if the price I paid the week before could be adjusted to the sale price, they told me they could but I would have to go to the XXXX, NY store to receive the credit because it was registered as a sale from their store. I drove to the XXXX store and spoke to a sales associate there and they credited my original purchase price {$100.00} plus tax for a total of {$100.00} credit. The total cost of the purchase should have been {$1300.00} with the credit for the sale price and the separate credit of {$100.00} for opening a Home Depot credit card. I called the credit card representative and explained the discrepancy when I received my credit card statement and they explained to me that they can not give both credits. I explained that if I purchased the items on sale and opened a credit card account I would have received the {$100.00} credit for opening the account but the associate I spoke to, XXXX # XXXX, stated it does not work like that and they can not give 2 credits for the same items. I believe the {$100.00} credit is separate and distinct from the credit I received because the item was on sale. When I opened the credit card account I was told by the representative that I would receive the {$100.00} credit for opening the account. It does not state You can not get the {$100.00} credit if the items purchased are on sale."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of 2019 I disputed and made an attempt to correct a few errors that were being reported on my Experian credit report. Two of these errors were two accounts that had gone onto collections ( medical bills ). The other two errors were accounts that were still being reported after 7 years of being reported negatively. The two medical bills that were reported were not paid by my insurance in which I was not aware of. I'm not saying that the bills are not mine, just should be given the opportunity to make payment arrangements on them instead of them being turned into a collection agency, then turned in to the credit bureaus.

I contacted XXXX XXXX  telling them to check their information and delete this wrong report but they stated they are unable to do anything about it. I am a responsible U.S. resident who works and pays his bills and taxes on time.

Thank you for your support and understanding."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Im submitting this complaint with XXXX because my credit score was negatively impacted due to XXXX reporting late payments against me. My credit report shows late payments were reported during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I was a loyal customer to XXXX ever since I received my Credit Card in XX/XX/XXXX and I always made my payments on time. I had the ability to pay my bill to XXXX for the months reported as late and I scheduled my payments to be withdrawn from my bank account on-time for those bills. XXXX either did not properly send a request for payment from my bank, or did and something prevented the money transfer to XXXX. I was never properly informed by XXXX about any impending or existing missed payments on my account for the months reported as late. I also never received any indication from my bank account of a returned item due to not having proper funds in my account to pay my bill to XXXX. I only found my original payments were not posted when I logged into my online XXXX account. I immediately paid my bill with my debit card and confirmed with my bank the following day to ensure the payments had successfully been transferred to XXXX. 

I'm only bringing this issue to the attention of others now because I did not know XXXX was reporting any of these payments as late to credit reporting agencies until I reviewed my credit report earlier this year. I have been negatively impacted when trying to apply for other forms of credit for almost 6 years due to late payments on my record caused by XXXX. Since these late payments are not the result of my wrongdoing, and due to the circumstances listed above, I respectfully request for XXXX to remove the late payments during the months of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Please consider my track record of on-time payments as proof I take my financial obligations seriously.

If I fail to pay by XX/XX/XXXX, I am subject to a {$91.00} late fee and possibly issues with my credability. I made an online payment from by checking account at XXXX XXXX XXXX bank for the {$2200.00} on XX/XX/2019. Since this is an electronic payment, Dovenmuehle should ( and usually does ) receive the payment by the next business day, which was XX/XX/XXXX. The full amount of {$2200.00} was deducted from my checking account XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX bank on XX/XX/2019 with an entry "" BP-Dovenmuehle Mortg Conf # - XXXX '' See XXXX XXXX XXXX Statement attached ). However, on XX/XX/2019 and to my surprise and dismay, I got a call from XXXX at Dovenmuehle 's Collections Department saying I failed to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment and that I now owe them the {$91.00} for the late fee. I told XXXX that I paid Dovenmuehle on XX/XX/XXXX. She later confirmed this. I asked her to investigate why I was being called when I in fact made the payment. XXXX was unable to help. 
Then, on XX/XX/XXXX, Dovenmuehle finally issed a statement ( see attached ) to reflect my XX/XX/XXXX payment ( this is usually done only a couple of days after I pay ) saying I made the XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. No where does it say in the statement or elsewhere that my payment was timely. 

I need a written statement from Dovenmuehle that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was timely and not subject to a late fee and was received well before the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I also want investigated whether this behavior on the part of Dovenmuehle is in any way retaliatory or connected with my recent application for loan modification to XXXX XXXX at Dovenmuehle due to me being unemployed and being the subject of another complaint I am making to Dovenmuehle. In other words, this instant unusual behavior seems to occur just after I applied for and then appealed and was denied a loan modification due to my long term unemployment, and my subsequent complaint to XXXX and XXXX. I would like to know if they are bullying me as a result and if I shluld expect more of this kind of behavior from Dovenmuehle in the future."

Mortgage,"For federal regulators and law enforcement. Wells Fargo continues to send unwanted XXXX notifications in delaying and distracting from answering the questions posed to this criminal company in their violations of federal regulatory law as well as criminal law concerning the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ) and various other regulatory violations as well as criminal fraud and money laundering. They distract and delay answering these questions as it will expose their criminal activity and the activity of Wachovia Bank in 2007 when banks were making windfalls on refinance loans disregarding rules and regulations, competence in transactions by their employees, and fraud to the American consumer. By the shear volume of these refinances and the money that was made, these banks exposed themselves to their shoddy workmanship and to remedy blamed the customers for their mistakes. 

Questions were : 1 ) Why did Wells Fargo sue my person when their acquired bank made the mistake in not requiring a XXXX   balance HELOC not be closed prior to closing knowing the account existed as reported on the credit report and by customer that it existed. Customer paid {$380.00} for that credit report and is the responsibility of the lender to underwrite such disclosure? 2 ) Why did Wells Fargo not notify attorneys of borrower and defendant in their lawsuit against borrower that they dropped their frivolous lawsuit and sold the mortgage to XXXX XXXX as required by federal law? 

Wells Fargo is deliberately trying to confuse and deflect their liability, both civil and criminal, by delaying and reiterating their false narrative to the CFPB and the OCC. I would request a formal investigation by the US Department of Justice and the OCC to begin to expose the criminal behavior of this bank, Wells Fargo and other banks including Wachovia who committed crimes out of greed during the housing bubble."
Mortgage,"In XXXX we moved from XXXX  to XXXX due to a job offer in XXXX. We put our home on the market, but removed it as a favor to a family we knew that needed a place to rent for a year. That turned into

t wo years. And deep regrets for many reasons. After eight
years of renting the house to various renters, many of whom did not pay rent, and several who damaged the property, we were unable to make the repairs necessary to keep owning it as a rental property, and it was still upside-down in value. We found a buyer for a short sale, presented Chase with a complete and reasonable short sale purchase offer in XXXX. 

Instead of closing on our offer in a timely manner, Chase sat on the file for 10 months, constantly threatening us and offering us mortgage refinancing that we could not afford. After around ten months, they initiated foreclosure. Shortly after that, in XXXX, after 11 months of stalling, they suddenly closed on the original short sale offer. Some time later, they sent us a letter apologizing for their mishandling of our foreclosure initiation in particular, and enclosed a check for ~ {$150.00} or so as a sop for our troubles. I was very angry. 

The only major negatives that exist on our credit are that started foreclosure and the short sale. Last week we applied for and were denied a mortgage refinance for the lowest rate in decades. The foreclosure start was the final straw that prevented that. 

We need that foreclosure start removed from our credit. It should not be there. We believe that it was put there in pure spite by Chase, with no intention of following through, just to hurt us further, when they were going to take the short sale offer anyway as evidenced by their closure on the short sale soon after."

I purchased furniture and electronics for my new home at the total cash option price of {$6800.00} with an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX with the ability to pay in full within 30 days of expiration date which would be XXXX/XXXX. 
I called Conns at number above as stated in there letter attached on XX/XX/XXXX to get the accurate payoff prior to making the final payment. The representative told me that it could take up to 3 days to get the payoff and told me she would request it and try to call on XX/XX/XXXX to try to get it. I therefore called on XX/XX/XXXX and requested the accurate payoff once again. The rep told me it was {$930.00}. I informed her to make a note in the file that I needed to make sure this was accurate to ensure I do not get charged the interest on the credit by paying it off within the time period. She informed me the amount was accurate. The payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount given by the rep as the accurate payoff. I called the following week to verify and was told I did not meet the terms of the agreement because the rep I spoke to failed to include a XXXX administrative fee to the total she provided me. I told the rep that they could review the notes as I specifically wanted to ensure the amount was accurate. The rep I called regarding my complaint did see my notes requesting that she add my concern that this needs to be the accurate amount and he agreed she did document that. I dont feel that Conns treated me fairly as their rep provided me the inaccurate payoff and due to their agents error the administrative fee was not added. I would have easily paid the {$100.00} administrative fee to avoid paying well over {$2.00} thousand in interest fees. I called on 2 different occasions trying to resolve this and was promised an email or call back from management and never received one. I would like this resolved fairly as I tried to comply with there terms and depended on their agent and requirements to call them directly for the accurate payoff."

Can you think of the day when your bank account is deducted without notice? 
They told me there was a notice when I signed the contract, I had the signature, I asked them to bring out my signature paper, they didn't have any, and then found some paper for me, in a pile of very small words can not see! I asked them do you explain the terms of the contract to the client? They say they can watch it!! They deducted the money from my bank without any notice in 8 days!!

I was immediately give a hard time by a teammate XXXX. She was beyond rude. She acted like she didn't want to open a business relationship, or lacked training. She didn't know what forms were needed or how to proceed. Then told me I HAD to produce paper copies of the documents, that she wouldn't print them. I advised her that my small business is paperless ... of course I am growing more irritated as she had given me a 9 page BOF form to complete via handwriting. She was quite condescending, which lead to me being stern about the discrimination I was receiving. Next thing I know the branch manager came over to lecture me and tell me to lower my voice. The worst banking experience EVER. My wife has been in banking for 14+ years and would never get away with treating a client that way, it was not client centric. When I got home, I wrote a formal complaint to the company via their secure website Confirmation # XXXX. I received no return message. Only a representative by the name of XXXX calling from XXXX - to further chastise me and tell my behavior is inappropriate. - And told me how I have to act, that I'm not allowed to be upset due to their laziness in the branch. That my feelings are not valid as a client. 

Fast forward to today, when I receive a letter mailed to me from Navy Federal that advised its due to a "" recent incident '' at a branch. It continues to say that I exhibited unacceptable behavior.

Mortgage,"Greetings, Well, after 3 mouths the facts have not been answered on this matter. I have sent Nation Star Mortgage documents of all facts on this issue. The fact that you have not rebutted proof of claim point by point. I will now inform you I'm of the age of Majority, of sound mind and competent to testify. The fact of the matter is I signed a promissory note for value and Nation star Mortgage has accepted the note as Legal Tender. All Promissory notes are a tender of payment of a obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract. The promissory note under Title 7 CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS 1951.15- Return of paid-in-full or satisfied notes to borrower. The notes will be returned to the borrower after the payment in full or execute an appropriate affidavit regarding the lost notes. I have requesting a affidavit of truth requesting that you produce my wet ink note which has been dis-honored. Code of federal regulations 1901.503 Definitions. ( 1 ) - ( 19 ) insurance of notes and 1901.508 Servicing of insured notes outstanding with investors. The holder will endorse the insured note as follows : "" Pay to the order of the United States of America. Without recourse ''. As the facts I have stated in our contract # XXXX Conditional Acceptance for the Value/Agreement/ Counter Offer to Acceptance of Offer. The Obligation 's of public debt of the United States of America is discharged though the banks. Nation star Mortgage Services has refused to answer my questions with detailed specific answers, we will presume that there is a concealment of material of facts and that the promissory note has been altered and stolen and that I provided the money that Nation star Mortgage claims have lent to me. If you claim that there is an agreement and a loan, then you must stop concealing material facts, answer my questions, and tell me if the promissory note was recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star or the Promissory note was stolen. According to my records, the promissory note was stolen or recorded as a loan from me to Nation Star and that Nation Star never paid one cent as adequate consideration to purchase the promissory note from me creating the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. I am now demanding that you either stop concealing material facts and answer my questions if you claim that there is an agreement or that you return the stolen promissory note. If you claim that the promissory note was a loan from me to Nation Star Mortgage, I demand that you immediately repay the loan by returning the promissory note and stop the damage to me. I am hereby offering to discharge the alleged debt provided that you give specific answers to my questions regarding the alleged debt and I will payoff or discharged the alleged debt using the same specie of funds or money or money equivalent that Nation Star Mortgage used to fund the alleged loan or similar instrument thus ending all liens and interests. One of the requirements of a negotiable instrument is that the instrument must be payable for a fixed amount of money. My question is, from your point of view according to your understanding of the agreement, is money deposited recorded as a bank asset or as a bank liability? Please list all forms of money or negotiable instruments you and Nation Star Mortgage are involved in, issuing the alleged loan, use as or like or as a substitute as money or credit used to fund checks or bank drafts. Specifically, did you or Nation Star Mortgage use my promissory as a bank asset which was offset by a bank liability? Specifically was my promissory note used to fund a check or bank draft? If my promissory note was used to fund a check, then I provided the money to fund the so called loan and you never lent me one cent of your money to purchase the note from me. Therefore, the economics are similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling against me, which I never agreed to and which is not part of the agreement. According to me if you used my promissory note to fund a check, you stole my promissory note or you recorded it as a loan from me to you and you still owe me money that you never lent me. Stealing changed the cost and the risk of the transaction. I want to know specifically did you intend to create the economics similar to stealing my promissory note as part of the agreement? Please answer yes or no. If you refuse to tell me, then we have fraud in the factum, which makes you no longer the holder in due course. No title passes with a theft. Since the promissory note is forged, and no good title passes with a forged document, you are not the holder. I demand that the stolen forged promissory note now be returned or you answer all of my questions in this notice and previous notices explaining the terms and conditions of the alleged agreement concerning the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. To be a holder in due course you must perform the following 3 deeds : 1. Purchase the promissory note from me. 2. Take the promissory note  in good faith using honesty, absence of malice and the absence of design to defraud or seek an unconscionable advantage ( See XXXX XXXX XXXX for good faith ) and 3. Have no notice of any defenses against payment of other claims on the promissory note. Nation Star Mortgage agreed to the following general terms and conditions of the loan agreement : 1. Nation Star Mortgage must use their money or credit as adequate consideration to purchase the agreement from me to repay the loan. 2. Nation Star Mortgage involved in the alleged loan did not accept anything of value from me that would be used to fund a check or similar instrument in approximately the amount of the alleged loan. 3. Nation Star Mortgage must follow Generally accepted accounting principles as required by CPA audit opinions. 4. The intent of the agreement is the party who funded the loan is to be repaid the money. 5. All material facts are to be disclosed in the writing agreement.6. The holder must repay the loan in the same specie of money or credit or thing of value the financial institution involved in the loan used to fund the loan check or similar instrument, thus ending all interest and liens. 7. The loan transaction does not create the economics similar to stealing, counterfeiting and swindling. The agreement that I entered into has the above seven elements in it. According to the bookkeeping entries, Nation Star Mortgage breached all seven basic elements of the agreement and Nation Star Mortgage and then concealed material facts of the agreement. I am demanding adequate assurance of due performance that the above seven elements are part of the loan agreement or I demand that the Nation Star Mortgage return a XXXX loan balance. 
The question is Why you Can not produce the promissory note? Answer is because they are a bill of exchange, legal tender and used to discharge public debt. NOTICE OF MEMORANDUM OF LAW POINTS AND AUTHORITIES IN SUPPORT OF INTERNATIONAL BILL OF EXCHANGE Points and Authorities in Support of International Bills of Exchange or International Promissory Note Those who constitute an association nationwide of private, unincorporated persons engaged in the business of banking to issue notes against these obligations of the United States due them ; whose private property is at risk to collateralize the governments debt and currency, by legal definitions, a national banking association ; such notes, issued against these obligations of the United States to that part of the public debt due its Principals and Sureties are required by law to be accepted as legal tender of payment for all debts public and private, and are defined in law as obligations of the United States, on the same par and category with Federal reserve notes and other currency and legal tender obligations.

The International Bill of Exchange is legal tender as a national bank note, or note of a National Banking Association, by legal and/or statutory definition ( UCC 4-105, 12CFR Sec. 229.2, 210.2, 12 USC 1813 ), issued under Authority of the United States Code 31 USC 392, 5103, which officially defines this as a statutory legal tender and is issued in accordance with 31 USC 3123 and HJR 192 ( 1933 ) which establish and provide for its issuance as Public Policy in remedy for discharge of equity  interest recovery on that portion of the public debt to its Principals and Sureties bearing the Obligations of THE UNITED STATES. This is a statutory remedy for equity interest recovery due the principles and sureties of the United States for discharge of lawful debts in commerce in conjunction with US obligations to that portion of the public debt it is intended to reduce. During the financial crisis of the depression in XXXX, gold, silver and real money were removed as a foundation for our financial system. In its place the substance of the American citizenry : their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them was, in effect, pledged by the government and placed at risk as the collateral for US debt, credit and currency for commerce to function. This is well documented in the actions of Congress and the President at that time and in the Congressional debates that preceded the adoption of the reorganizational measures : Senate Document No. 43, 73rd Congress, 1st Session, stated, Under the new law the money is issued to the banks in return for Government obligations, bills of exchange, drafts, notes, trade acceptances, and bankers acceptances. The money will be worth XXXX cents on the debt because it is backed by the credit of the nation. It will represent a mortgage on all the homes and other property of all the people in the Nation. ( Which lawfully belongs to these private citizens. ) The National Debt is defined as mortgages on the wealth and income of the people of a country. ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ) Their wealth, their income. The reorganization is evidenced by : The Emergency Banking Act, XX/XX/XXXX, House Joint Resolution 192, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX public law 73-10 ) And the series of Executive Orders that surrounded them : 6073- Reopening of Banks. Embargo on Gold Payments and Exports, and Limitations on Foreign Exchange Transactions. XX/XX/XXXX 6111-Transactions in foreign exchange are permitted under Governmental Supervision. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Forbidding the hoarding of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates. XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, Congress had passed An Act to provide for the establishment of Federal reserve banks, to furnish an elastic currency, to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a more effective supervision of banking in the United States, and for other purposes. The Act is commonly known as the Federal Reserve Act. One of the purposes for enacting the Federal Reserve Act was : ( 3 ) to authorize hypothecation of obligations including United States bonds or other securities which Federal reserve Banks are authorized to hold under Section 14 ( a ) ; 12 USC ; ch. 6, 38 Stat. 251 Sect 14 ( a ) The term hypothecation as stated in Section 14 ( a ) of the Act is defined : 1. Banking. Offer of stocks, bonds, or other assets owned by a party other than the borrower as collateral for a loan, without transferring title. If the borrower turns the property over to the lender who holds it for safekeeping, the action is referred to as a pledge. If the borrower retains possession, but gives the lender the right to sell the property in event of default, it is a true hypothecation. 2. Securities. The pledging of negotiable securities to collateralize a brokers margin loan. The broker pledges the same securities to a bank as collateral for a brokers loan, the process is referred to as re-hypothecation. [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, pg. 228 ( XXXX ) ] As seen from the definitions, in hypothecation there is equitable risk to the actual owner. Section 16 of the current Federal Reserve Act, which is codified at 12 USC 411, declares that Federal Reserve Notes are obligations of the United States. So we see the full faith and credit of the United States, which is the substance of the American citizenry, their real property, wealth, assets and productivity that belongs to them, is thereby hypothecated and re-hypothecated by the United States to its obligations as well as to the Federal Reserve for the issuance and backing of Federal Reserve Notes, as legal tender, for all taxes, customs, and other public dues.

The United States can not pledge or risk the property and wealth of its private citizens, for any government purpose, without legally providing them remedy to recover what is due them on their risk. This principle is so well established in English common law and in the history of American jurisprudence. The 14th amendment provides : no person shall be deprived ofproperty without due process of law. The Courts have long ruled to have ones property legally held as collateral or surety for a debt, even when he still owns it and still has it, is to deprive him of it since it is at risk and could be lost for the debt at any time. The United States Supreme Court said, in United States v. XXXX [ 13 Wall, 623, 627 ], Private property, the Constitution provides, shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.

XXXX, 371 U.S. 132, when the Court said : sureties compelled to pay debts for their principal have been deemed entitled to reimbursement, even without a contractual promise And probably there are few doctrines better established XXXX XXXX XXXX, 5th edition, defines surety : One who undertakes to pay or to do any other act in event that his principal fails therein. Everyone who incurs a liability in person or estate for the benefit of another, without sharing in the consideration, stands in the position of a surety. Constitutionally, and in the laws of equity, the United States could not borrow or pledge the property and wealth of its private citizens, put at risk as collateral for its currency and credit, without legally providing them equitable remedy for recovery of what is due them. The United States government, of course, did not violate the law or the Constitution in this way in order to collateralize its financial reorganization, but did, in fact, provide such a legal remedy so that it has been able to continue on since XXXX to hypothecate the private wealth and assets of those classes of persons by whom it is owned, at risk backing the governments obligations and currency, by their implied consent, through the government having provided such remedy, as defined and codified above, for recovery of what is due them on their assets and wealth at risk. The provisions for this are found in the same act of Public Policy HJR-192, public law 73-10 that suspended the gold standard, abrogated the right to demand payment in gold, and made Federal Reserve notes for the first time legal tender, backed by the substance or credit of the nation. All US currency since that time is only credit against the real property, wealth and assets belonging to the private sovereign American people, taken and/or pledged by THE UNITED STATES to its secondary creditors as security for its obligations. Consequently, those backing the nations credit and currency could not recover what was due them by anything drawn on Federal Reserve notes without expanding their risk and obligation to themselves. Any recovery payments backed by this currency would only increase the public debt its citizens were collateral for, which an equitable remedy was intended to reduce, and in equity would not satisfy anything. And there was, as still, no longer actual money of substance to pay anybody. There are other serious limitations on our present system. Since the institution of these events, for practical purposes of commercial exchange, there has been no actual money in circulation by which debt owed from one party to another can actually be repaid. Federal Reserve Notes, although made legal tender for all debts public and private in the reorganization, can only discharge a debt. Debt must be paid with value or substance ( i.e. gold, silver, barter, labor, or a commodity ). For this reason HJR-192 ( 1933 ),  which established the public policy of our current monetary system, repeatedly uses the technical term of discharge in conjunction with payment in laying out public policy for the new system."

Recd alert from XXXX XXXX of credit filing of delinquency ; contacted Rushmore. They said they never received payment ; I gave them all the information of the receipt of submitting. I've called numerous times and they kept saying they never received. Gave them the tracking # I had. 
There is no one else I can speak with ; there is no email address that can be used to communicate and deliver documentation. Either fax or regular mail. No attempt on their part to track receipt of said money using the information provided. 
rec 'd another statement dated XX/XX/XXXX indicating owing {$0.00}. Again I called and resubmitted the information regarding payment information ; they replied they had no way to track it, as they never received. Another notification of now the delinquency of over 60 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX - another call to Rushmore asking for assistance of tracking my payment and resolving the credit reporting. Still no assistance in helping. Therefore, I went to my bank and REWIRED ANOTHER PAYMENT. 
XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX CST resent ANOTHER wire transfer with an additional cost to me of {$25.00} -- Also, contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and they have record from XXXX , Rushmore Loan Management Services received funds XX/XX/XXXX. Trace # is XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - again called Rushmore to give them information that I just wired ANOTHER PAYMENT and was told to call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX to verify they received. 
XX/XX/XXXX - called and they verified payment received and closed account. I asked about next step in resolving credit reporting and also let them know they now have received TWO payments from me. Gave them additional information again for THEIR bank with a tracking # XXXX. Their records indicate a follow up is needed by me next Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX. 

Asked them to report to credit agencies their reporting that the account was not delinquent which affected my CREDIT SCORE greatly. They indicated they would send to consumer affairs department for investigation however it is still under investigation. They offer no customer service to assist in rectifying the situation other than the customer doing all the calling ; following up. I was told to call XX/XX/XXXX, or I can mail/fax communication and wait again for reply. There is no other communication other than the one customer service line and you are unable to speak with anyone else ; no supervisor or anyone other than the rep on the phone. 

This loan was first taken from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and the account was turned over in XX/XX/XXXX to Rushmore Loan. In six years paying the mortgage for a payoff amount of {$0.00} this company has ruined my credit and is making no attempts to assist in correcting the problem. 

As of today XX/XX/XXXX, Rushmore has now an additional {$73.00} due to the double payment in which they can not tell me how or when the payment will be reissued back to me. Again, no one to speak with at all to assist in resolving issue. 

I have made every attempt possible to rectify the situation with no assistance whatsoever from Rushmore other than being treated like an individual who is trying NOT to pay a {$0.00} debt when I clearly paid a {$15000.00} debt I owed timely. 

I am looking for restitution of my {$73.00} over payment ; in addition to clearing my credit report of false information."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2014, I entrusted this company called Clear One Advantage/XXXX   XXXX XXXX to help me consolidate payments to five creditors. I should have known something was wrong when I received paperwork with another company 's name on it. The rep insured me that their team was working with them to be able to make lower payments. I was instructed by the rep to NEVER answer the creditors phone calls to explain anything because the person calling probably would not know Clear One Advantage was working behind the scenes with the company.

My credit score was a nice XXXX and NONE of my payments were late. In fact, I had a perfect payment history with all of them. I fell on hard times and wanted to be proactive about making sure my credit score stayed intact. Clear One was receiving payments from me. 

Several months went by with me being reassured things were being taken care of ... and then I found out NOTHING was happening because this fraudulent company was WAITING for my debts to go into delinquency so they could come save the day. All the payments I sent them were just sitting, nothing going to the creditors. By the time I realized what was happening to me, it was already too late. My debts were going into charge-off status and there was nothing I could do. 

My great credit plummeted 200+ points. I suffered XXXX  and hopelessness. What did I do wrong? I had researched this company, saw good reviews, researched more - I did everything I knew to do. 
Finally, I confronted this company some months later and I was told conveniently the rep assigned to me abruptly resigned. No one helped me. They left me to rot and be among those who are subprime targets. All the years of perfect credit down the tubes."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I received a letter from GM Financial in XXXX of XXXX stating they were moving to a new billing system in XXXX. In XXXX of XXXX I received another letter from GM Financial stating they were having issues with their billing system and I should pay the statements I receive and they will eventually start billing correctly. 

My normal lease payment is XXXX XXXX/mo. and in XXXX of XXXX GM Financial began billing me incorrectly, so I paid exactly what was on the statement and assumed they would send me a statement to catch up on payments. 

Inaccurate statements for XXXX were as follows : ( I have copies of all of these ) XX/XX/XXXX - Total amount due {$30.00}. I paid {$30.00} ( No late charges XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - Total amount due {$30.00}. I paid {$30.00} ( No late charges ) XX/XX/XXXX - Total amount due {$30.00}. I paid {$30.00} XXXX No late charges ) XXXX XXXX - Total amount due {$430.00}. I paid {$1500.00} XXXX No late charges ) **May XXXX - Total amount due {$540.00}. I paid {$540.00} ( No late charges ) *In XXXX of XXXX I was contacted by a collections agency stating they were going to repossess my XXXX if I didn't pay {$1500.00}. 
**In XXXX of XXXX the account started billing correctly. 

When I was told my account was in collections I paid the {$1500.00} they wanted and immediately contact GM Financial to be sure this would not affect my excellent credit score. Customer service was less than helpful at first. The first representative I talked to said I should have been making my regular monthly payments, my credit would be affected, and she asked if I "" Only paid the amount due on all of my invoices '' - I answered "" Yes '' and asked for a supervisor who again wasn't very helpful. After several calls back and forth I finally got someone who looked into everything and he told me this was happening to quite a few people and apologized on behalf of GM Financial. He told me they did report this to the credit agencies, but I would be able to dispute it w/o issue and he said it would be noted on my account. 

My credit score did take quite a hit from this and when I filed a dispute it was denied. I did everything GM Financial asked of me, I paid all of the statements that were sent to me ( on time ), my statements show all payments were on-time, and GM Financial did not contact me a single time to tell me they were sending my account to collections or my vehicle was being sent to repossession. 

My current credit score has one blemish - 30 days late - GM Financial - XXXX and GM Financial is completely to blame for this. I recently had to take a higher mortgage rate because my bank sees late payments as a risk. The mortgage APR I was hoping to get was 3.99 % and I had to take one at 4.125 % Again, I have never been late on ANY of my payment to ANY of my creditors."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I filed Chapter XXXX bankruptcy, which including all of my accounts and XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX then sent that account to collections. My attorney sent them all the necessary paperwork. In XXXX I was unaware that they had put a lien on my house until I went to sell. Another motion was filed on XX/XX/XXXX including XXXX XXXX, again, they were added back to the original bankruptcy of XXXX. It was removed, from the title due to the evidence presented and my house was sold. I then received countless collections letters from a Collection Agency, which I sent to my attorney. I then disputed this online 3 times the credits bureaus with no change. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent XXXX, Transunion, and XXXX certified mail, return receipt requested with all of the following, 1 ) my original bankruptcy, 2 ) the amendment to it, 3 ) a notarized copy of my DL and SS card to prove my identity, 4 ) a current copy of their current credit report, and 5 ) even proof of receipt of filing in court. They have since documented this on my credit bureau and the collections remained. Says creditor disputes this. All three are the same. My credit score has now dropped below 700."
Debt collection,"I noticed on all XXXX of my credit reports that there is a collection from XXXX that i have no knowledge of, have never dealt with them before, and believe its due to an identity theft. I want this collection removed and to not report again or i will be seeking further action."
Mortgage,"when I first notice that I was going to run into problum with my Mortage payment 's. I contacted toe company and tried to workout a back payme n't plan. the company agreed to work with me. the company instructed me that they needed sirtify fund 's every Month. I agreeded with the company. So the company gave me an account number to wired the fund 's every Month.

I was taken advantage of becaused I suffer from XXXX? I'm over welmed by that company."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am disturbed that you continue to list the dismissed bankruptcy as confirmed. 

Although it is your policy to keep reporting bankruptcies which are filed or adjusted for 10 years, the Fair Credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681c relating to Bankruptcy about dismissals or filings.

The law states from date of adjudication or date of order for relief. Any case, civil or otherwise, that has been dismissed no longer exists in the eyes of the law and a case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. Therefore, you have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed nonexistent."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have an account with CreditKarma to keep track of my credit and accounts. In mid XX/XX/XXXX ( around XX/XX/XXXX as best I can tell ) my account was compromised and the person who accessed it changed the email and password associated with it. Despite the account being tied to my name, social security number, and info I no longer have access to it. CreditKarma not only did not provide the adequate protection of my account and data, they did not even notify me that my information had changed so I had no idea it had been compromised. 

I noticed this in mid-XX/XX/XXXX and reached out to CreditKarma for help. Despite multiple attempts to reach their support team and even tweeting at them I have yet to hear a response. Meanwhile fradulent checking accounts and credit cards have been opened in my name. 

CreditKarma has been irresponsible in their handling of my data and their ability to resolve this issue in a timely manner."

Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/2019 I have opened a dispute with the bank against XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX for a trip to XXXX paid for on XX/XX/2019. 
The company 's representative cancelled our tour participation while in XXXX as retaliation for bringing up an illegal practice of selling the health supplements as medical treatment with supposed authorization by the US FDA. The dispute was documented in detail including a statement from the FDA in a 14 page fax sent to Capitol One and confirmed received. 
Subsequently the Capital One issued a credit and then check in the amount of the dispute. 
Today I received a letter from Capital One stating that there will be a charge back as the company forwarded a merchant 's statement about the merchant 's cancellation policy regardless of fact that the merchant 's representative cancelled our tour and not us. Subsequently I authorized my husband XXXX XXXX to speak to Capital One dispute dept and my husband was informed that the Capital One didn't even bother to analyze any info sent to the bank by me in XXXX and the notice with charge back was sent out automatically upon receipt of merchant 's response without any analytical input or review of documentation provided prior to this decision. 
It is apparent that the Capital One dispute dept process is fake and actually nobody has read provided documentation and evidence ( this fact was actually acknowledged by the employee XXXX in XXXX, FL service center ) It is apparent that the Capital One 's process is to automatically close the dispute and re-bill the account without any type of analysis or even comprehension of the response determined by submitted docs and evidence. This not only shows bias against the customer using the card that didn't receive the service paid for but it shows the Capital One is aiding and abetting fraudulent activity by the merchant. 
The only excuse and justification for this state of affairs given was that this is an automated system which both defies logic and a common sense. 
It is also very deceptive as it appears that the bank is interested in getting the customer involved in prolonged and long process of dispute in bad faith as it has no intention to either analyze the info provided and provide a determination of the outcome of the case based on documents and evidence provided. 

Two questions : 1 ) why the dispute system is designed this way and what is the percentage of disputes that are determined in favor of cardmembers vs the merchants? 
2 ) what are the employees that have dealt with my complaint ( please provide employee numbers as I want to determine the case flow and who actually made a decision in the process in what time.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have contacted Equifax multiple times and sent the requested documents to them. For years they lie about not being able to locate my credit profile. Which is complete nonsense, its impossible to get them on the phone!!"
Debt collection,I recently went on my credit report and saw I have a collection from Midwest Recovery Systems. I called to find out why this has been placed on my credit report to and they said it was from a XXXX XXXX of {$840.00} in XXXX from XXXX XXXX. I have never received or applied for a payday loan and this is fraudulent. I asked for a proof of debt and they would not send. I have never received funds from this company and they need to be removed this from ALL XXXX credit bureaus asap! This is a scam to collect money. XXXX XXXX is no longer in business as well. This is complete Fraud!
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX I received an alert that there was a transfer in the amount of {$1600.00} out of my checking account. I did not authorize a transaction for that amount, so I logged into my bank account and found that someone has transferred {$1500.00} from my 1 year old son 's custodial savings account to our checking account and made a XXXX Payment in the amount of {$1600.00}. The thing was the name was familiar, so I contacted the person because we are good friends and of course it was not them, even the number attached to XXXX   Payment did not match. I contacted the fraud department at Chase Bank right away and froze all accounts and reported the fraud. They said it was done through my login and device, however, I did not complete these transactions, obviously I was hacked. Next day went to the bank and closed all accounts and credit cards and opened new ones. I had noticed also there were small XXXX amounts being deducted the whole month of XXXX from his Savings until they transferred the large amount out. I put in a second claim and that one was refunded. However, they are now saying after a month of telling me one story after another. Chase has said they will not refund the money for it is not a fraudulent charge. It was not done under my account and usual device no flags came up. Even though I am disputing the payment and I did not make the payment. They told me there is nothing they will do. So now my son lost {$1500.00} through XXXX Payment to someone and they got away with it."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","On XX/XX/2019 applied for installment loan with Advance America Center, in ohio. I was told my applications was "" denied by XXXX.

'' I am not a military service person and have never served in any branch of the military and my name is what it is. It was further communicated that "" in order to be approved for an installment loan a customer must pass MLA validation. '' [ however, from my interpretation of the law, that is not the way the Ohio law reads ]. Additionally, communication states that "" if the lending center updates the POS [ point of sale ] to be a valid name [ meaning name other than my legal name and usage ] the customer should pass MLA validation and no longer be denied. '' I spoke w/a XXXX representative on XX/XX/2019, who says that my name is not listed w/MLA and don't know why it should or would be since I have no military status or service. Initially, Advance America claimed to have gotten this information from XXXX and XXXX. I spoke w/representatives from XXXX and XXXX   who both says, "" not so. '' and is sending me a copy of my credit report. [ updated from 4 years ago ]. 

Now Advance America is denying me an installment loan because my name is not what they say it should be. 

I have been a customer w/Advance, off and on, for almost 15 years and used no other name than my legal name. Now they tell me they will approve me for a loan "" only '' if I apply using an illegal name. I have no outstanding accounts wi/Advance America. 

I feel this denial is discriminatory, suspect and unjust and blatantly a scapegoat for someone's negligence. I explained that all people make mistakes and i'm not upset about that, i'm upset that no one wants to correct it, but spend more time talking attitudinal with me about my name.

I clicked and after seeing that the figures on the screen changed dramatically, I realized that I had linked my checking account or shared my data with XXXX which is something I did not wish to do. 

So I tried to unlink it and was unable. 

An email from XXXX  would redirect me to Chase and instructions on how to unlink, the third  option after clicking on profile and settings was visit XXXX page. Problem is theres no such XXXX page and no way to unlink. 

I spent time trying to figure it out and called Chase where I waited on the phone for about half an hour. Then, waited to talk to a supervisor because the first advisor wanted to have me call the Chase fraud department, which would have screwed up all my accounts and send me down a huge rabbit hole. 

But this is not fraud exactly but a trick to access your data under a phony pretext  and then not be able to unlink XXXX from your bank account. 

The Chase supervisor XXXX also knew nothing about this gimmick and/or the lack of an XXXX page to unlink and called it credit journey. 

But nowhere on the page did it say credit journey. I just wished to unlink XXXX to my personal data. 

This was accomplished through another means not the prescribed bankXXXX method. 

Its obvious the bank and XXXX are in XXXX XXXX XXXX you into sharing your private information without any options. 

Although I was finally able to unlink, it took me an hour and I have also filed a complaint case # XXXX To what end I dont know. Its all rigged. Is it any wonder Americans are upset n I realize that the CFPB is not empowered to do anything at all about anything except take the banks money in political contributions, but this is so transparently a SCAM.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/2017 I stopped by XXXX XXXX XXXX to see how approximately how much a new bed would cost me. The head salesman, XXXX, took me to the beds and three other salesmen followed. I was shown the beds and told them I couldn't qualify because I had a car loan to pay first, I just wanted to know how much. XXXX said well l get all sorts of discounts and coupons because I'm the lead salesman and we can get you a really good price. I said howmuch, and he said it doesn't matter because I'll use the discounts. Just sign this and I run a credit check. I failed. So I got up to leave, I was in alot of pain and told XXXX I needed to leave. He said wait just a second, then another salesman came up and said sign this we have another place to check. This happened 3 time so I finally made it out the store.

A few days later, the bed was delivered to my house. I wasn't home but my daughter let them deliver it. 
The next thing I know, I get a bill from Wells Fargo for over {$3000.00}. First I was told Wells Fargo had declined me, which was ok by me because I wont do business with them because of their dishonest business practices and taking out credit cards you don't request. And guess what? I was sent a credit card I did not ask for. 
I called XXXX XXXX and told them to come pick up the bed I did not want it, and I said I had already told you I wouldn't use Wells Fargo because they were dishonest. 
I next called Well Fargo to tell them they needed to deal with XXXX XXXX. 
I called XXXX XXXX again and said pick up the bed within three days or I will put it on the curb. Did not hear back from XXXX XXXX, so I put it on the curb and it was picked up. I did not hear back from them nor did I hear back from Wells Fargo.

Furthermore, I have re-submitted the requested documentation to Equifax TWICE through both of the addresses they list on the letter ; they still can not seem to receive them even though I sent them via certified mail, return receipt requested, and have the signed receipts. This seems like an attempt by Equifax to avoid initiating or completing investigations within the 30-day time allotment."
Checking or savings account,"On around XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/2019. I discovered a former tenant stole my debit/credit card from my purse without me knowing until I went into the branch to take out money and was told over {$940.00} was gone having been spent at XXXX, XXXX, XXXX on gift cards to sell and buy drugs as he was a pain bill addict. While I was at the bank the fraudster was at a store charging at that moment. The teller cancelled the card and I went to the police and reported it asap. The thing is I have never used the card and charged on it. I just use the bank acct for my equity line of credit. I also have been at 5/3 for 20 years. I have a {$200000.00} line of credit. I have never filed a claim. When I called the fraud dept. it was a nightmare getting them to understand. I told them I thought I had the card but after looking for it realized it was gone. Just didn't know who had taken it until I requested the video from a store and the police officer did and we identified the fraudster. Then the police issued a warrant for grand larceny. I sent three police reports as the person charged in 3 different towns. It was very insulting for 5/3 to not credit me immediately and trust me. I appealed it and again they denied me my funds. This could have put me in a very difficult position if I had written checks against this account. My case # is XXXX. My account number at 5/3 is XXXX and the debit card was XXXX. I also asked why they did not have fraud monitoring for unusual spending on a card that HAD NEVER BEEN USED. And the police report was sent to them and the statement where they have issued a warrant. What more do they want. I am furious and would leave if I could. This person also took a XXXX card and spent {$200.00}. XXXX refunded me immediately. NO questions."

Debt collection,"The phone number contacted, the person contacted, was not asked to identify themselves, the person who answered said "" I don't believe this. '' and hung up. 
Within 40 seconds, the phone rang again from the same number, so I answered the phone, I began asking questions and when I mentioned the direct violations of both State and Federal violations : Calling more than once per day after having made contact Failure to identify with whom you are speaking with, ie ; "" You are XXXX XXXX XXXX? '' "" What is your SSN '', when I refused to give that information, I asked "" What information can you give to me? "" ... as a debt collector, I can refer to an address, the last 4 of a social, date of birth, etc. and then say that I either have the correct person on the phone or vacate the call with an apology. 

Disclosure to an un-known party on the telephone ... who the client is. 

These are all direct violations of all the State and local laws that each and every Americans holds dear and have the right to enforce. 

This company appears to have no training, doesn't follow Federal law and allows their employee 's to break Federal/State law at will, as I was told repeatedly that no laws had been broken without the definite confirmation that "" XXXX XXXX '' was speaking to the correct person. There was no Mini-miranda given and he refused to acknowledge any information other than my name, no confirming address, last 4 of the social, date of birth ... .nothing. 

We ended the call with I said it was XXXX in the long form and I was told that I need to rectify my response to him over a bad word.

During XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX I was advised by ancient to enter into an unemployment deferment. I was eligible to enter into an IBR that would count towards my 120 payments in a PSLF program. In XX/XX/XXXX, I was then advised to enter into standard repayment. Only because I could not afford repayment I looked into the matter further and realized I could have been an an IBR plan. 

During XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, I went against advisement and managed my account and entered an IBR. My financial situation was exactly the same as the previous 3 years. I was part-time employed at several colleges working over 30 hrs. In fact, since I was working over 30 hours I did not qualify for the deferment that was suggested. 

I am requesting that the months from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX be  counted towards my IBR. I am willing to pay back payments at the same rate that was determined for the period between XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. 

My current IBR payment is slightly high because I am now full-time which is a different financial situation. 

I have requested documentation from navies but was referred to my online account. they informed me all the information I need is there. but dates on deferments do not show."
Debt collection,"On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : Notified of unexpected dip in credit. Credit Karma listed "" collection '' as reason. I had no idea I had been sent to collections before I checked my credit score! I called the agency listed as "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to question the collection. I was told that on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received medical care from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, '' a company associated with a local hospital. I requested information and hinted that I wanted to dispute. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called my local hospital and doctor, both of which had no record of me being ordered or receiving care on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, let alone XXXX XXXX. I called "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to tell them that I wanted to file a dispute. The representative verified that I received service from "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX according to their records. I was told that the {$180.00} was what was left after insurance paid their part. He said that my only option to receive information, other than that from his business, would be to call "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' ... which just so happens to be bankrupt and without a valid phone number. I was told that I could file a dispute, and if my credit was still hurt, I could pay the {$180.00} during the process. After the dispute was settled, and if I was found correct, my {$180.00} would be returned to me. I was told the dispute process would take 60-90 days to be settled and that the process was started. 
XXXX/XXXX/XXXX : I called my insurance, who searched their archives for claims. They confirmed that they did not receive billing for any services in XXXX XXXX. I immediately called "" Midwest Recovery Systems, LLC '' to see where we were in the dispute process. A week had passed since I thought the representative had filed the complaint. The rep 's boss answered my call. He stated that the dispute was never filed, since I was questioning receiving care 3 years ago. I told him that it was my impression ( as well as my mother and father who listened and recorded the phone call on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) that the dispute was filed. The manager said that the rep. never filed the dispute and left a note that we might pay. The manager then clarified that we could not file and pay in hopes of being reimbursed after the dispute, which was new knowledge since the representative told us we could. The manager then said that the "" date of service '' ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) may not truly be the actual "" date I received care, '' which is another inconsistency from what I was told during both phone calls on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I alerted the manager to inconsistencies between my communication with the manager and what I had been told previously. 
Summary : The company never alerted me to being sent to collections ; I found out after my credit score was affected. I established communication with them first by calling them after seeing my score. I was lied to about the dispute process : the rep. told me it started and to wait 60-90 days. I called a week later ( 7 days into the 30 I had to file the dispute ) to find out it was never filed! I was lied to about the date of service. I feel like I was being coerced into paying since the rep. said that I could pay the {$180.00} while in the dispute process and have the possibility of being reimbursed if I am found to not be responsible for the debt ( which I later found out was a lie ). Had I never called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & waited the 60-90 days as told, I would have unconsciously admitted guilt and been responsible to pay. Had I paid the {$180.00} to help my credit during the dispute process ( in hopes of reimbursement ) I would have forfeited all money, since unlike what I was told on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, payment is admitting guilt. The inconsistencies among employers and communication with me, the client, is unfair business. Although the manager said the dispute process was officially started as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, I will mail a written notice to assure the process has started."

I have made numerous attempts, via phone and email to get full accounting of my escrow account. To date, only info I have is projected and what they claim was transferred. I also requested explanation how they can charge me for insurance lapse in coverage when loan was serviced with another company. I also paid previous servicer for lender placed insurance.

I have more than enough in my credit line and authorized on the account. I then asked to obtain their CRM transaction number and she would not provide this. I asked how to file an official complaint online or on the phone but she advised that only way to do this is by sending a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX. When asked who reference numbers I can use she said none. She then put me on a 25 minute hold to come back to say she can't help me. Both the team member and the supervisor where unprofessional and could not explain the policy to me to correct the situation. They said they could only talk to the Primary. So I went ahead and woke up my wife and instead of authenticating her, they said they will not and she will have the fraud department call us back. Why, well they never said on advised of any internal policy. I totally understand fraud issues and want to work these out with the company but this was way out of bounds and they could not advise me on how to clarify the situation.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I was recently added as an Authorized User to an American Express credit card without my knowledge. Reading the FDIC website for consumer protection Section 226.12 paragraph 12 ( a ) ( 1 ) states that a request or application for a card must be explicit. However, # 6 of the same paragraph allows the primary cardholder to request a credit card for anyone else. 

Apparently the exploitation of this legal-ese grey area allowed the credit card to be opened which then caused my credit score to decrease by nearly XXXX points ; in effect holding ME financially responsible for its use. 

When the account appeared on my credit report I immediately reported this to the credit bureaus and the CFPB : as not being my account, nor did I submit an application, or give approval to be an authorized user. The response from American Express to the CFPB complaint was that they are reporting accurately. 

My question isHow can an issuer give credit without authorization, affect my credit by reporting an account I did not authorize, and advise they are reporting an account accurately? Is that some type of childish word game? e.g. their response was almost mocking ; it may be fraud, but were reporting it accurately! 

I called the CFPB when I received the complaint response and was advised to write the FTC. Per their suggestion I have written the FTC the details of the unfair practice. 

I would like to submit this complaint/ account as fraud to stop any reporting to my credit report. I, again, did not request this account, have ever requested credit from American Express, or have knowledge of its opening, not will I ever request an account from American Express in the future. Also, all this was done while my credit line was purposefully frozen. 

My next course of action is a local consumer protections attorney as I am currently loan shopping. This fraudulent account ( and credit score reporting ) is causing a burdensome financial impact by affecting my chances at better tiered rates."

I have an online account with them and though I receive monthly bills on the account I did not receive any notification online that they were going to report me to the credit bureau. 

Can you help? Thank you."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","The reason I am writing to you is to state that Upstart is being inconsiderate, I have always been a loyal if not outstanding customer. Ive always considered it a priority to make all my payments on time. Unfortunately, I fell short of my own standards earlier this year, and I was over a month late in XX/XX/2018 ( payment reported as 30-59 days late ). Also, I had been carrying a sizable balance for several months but as I am writing to you now, I am in the process of paying of the balances on my Upstart account. their records will show that I had never been late with a payment until this unfortunate oversight. 

The reason for me to be off the schedule to make the payments is that I got married in XX/XX/2018 ( Proof of Marriage ). As a result, I travelled out for my honeymoon for a few days, having expected to be back in time to take care of my payments. Unfortunately, During the few days honeymoon, my wife fell very Ill and could not come back as planned. I wish all was well in our Honeymoon and had come back in time but now its too late for me to go back in time and fix the situation. This was not entirely my fault as I was not around to make payment. Were it not for this set back, I could have maintained my perfect record. I can assure you it wont happen again going forward. 

The reason for writing this letter is that Im planning to apply for a mortgage loan, and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. 

As a long-time customer in good standing, it would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment from my file that was reported in XX/XX/2018. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope youll approve of my request. 
I am attaching my travelling itinerary and marriage certificate for your reference."
Checking or savings account,"I made the mistake of allowing a "" friend '' to deposit a XXXX XXXX check into my account without knowing what XXXX XXXX is and it turned out that I was scammed. I bank with Columbia State Bank ( routing number XXXX ) and they have had my account locked for almost a month now. XXXX ( female ) is the "" Investigator '' on my account with Fraud Investigations. I wrote in my online banking all of the information I had ( where the check came from, the phone number of the person who deposited it and signed my name on the check as I did not sign that check which should be obvious looking at the signatures, etc. ) and despite how quickly the case should have been solved, XXXX did not even consult with me for information or even investigate anything at all regarding my account until I spoke with her yesterday about being able to withdraw my paycheck. I could tell that this was the first time she actually looked at my account. I posted the information on my online banking message center where I was informed by the bank ( and this is all in writing ) that Fraud Investigations has access to those messages, thus those messages should have been looked at by XXXX long before this. This is now 2 paychecks ( out of three that have been direct deposited/ACH from the same company, one of which covered the scam check 's result of a negative balance ) and a loan that I've had to jump through ridiculous hoops just to withdraw the money I rightfully earned. Before XXXX decided to ask me any questions about what happened, she decided they were closing my account for good and I requested they keep it open long enough for my paycheck to come in two days later ( which was yesterday ). So I spoke with XXXX yesterday at XXXX XXXX and she said that once the direct deposit from my job hard posted, I could withdraw my money. The only Columbia State Bank open on a Saturday is an hour and a half from where I live, but I drove there anyway, which does require transportation costs and irreplaceable time, because XXXX said I could withdraw it once it hard posted. XXXX failed to put a note in my account allowing the tellers to give me my paycheck just like she failed to investigate the case in the first place. I'm very dissatisfied with the carelessness, laziness, selfishness, inadequacies and lacking of intelligence that takes place in this Financial Institution 's Fraud Department and this is not going to be my final complaint. I also plan to post reviews and respond to surveys and make it very well-known how this bank handles customer finances until I have the satisfaction of knowing that XXXX has been at the very least reprimanded and faced with disciplinary action for her failure to actually do what my money paid her to do ... My money that she prevented me from accessing even though I, unlike her, actually do my job. Something needs to be done."

When I went to get my title loan, everything went smoothly. I was told that the printer wasn't working so I couldn't get a copy of my paperwork. This should have been a red flag, but I didn't catch it. My mother was with me and can testify to the fact that I was told this. I've been making my payments regularly. I renewed my loan in XXXX. Once again making regular payments. I've asked twice what my payoff was and both times were told the same number within a few dollars. That's when I suspected something was wrong. I can't make payments for 5 months and make no progress on my loan. Payments made were 200 to 300 dollars every month. This past Monday, I transferred money to my mother so that she could make my payment. I transferred {$200.00}, she took out the cash and made the payments. While she was there, she noticed that there's an app for the Title Loan company. We downloaded the app and checked on my account. This is when I noticed that I was only credited for {$40.00} to my account. When she pulled the receipt from her purse, it was an old receipt reprinted from XXXX showing a {$200.00} payment with a women 's name, when she made the payment to a man. When he gave her the receipt, she only looked to see that my account was credited and that the amount was correct. It was only when we saw that my payment was short did we look at the entire receipt. I realize that this is my word against his but this is the truth of what happened. I don't know how long my account has been skimmed but I want a forensic accounting and my account closed.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Approximately 18 months ago I requested that First Technology Federal Credit Union link my savings or checking account to my son 's First Technology Federal Credit Union checking account so that I could make an emergency transfer to his account. First Tech informed me that they could not set this up without my son being present at the branch. He lives out of state, so it was not possible and I did not pursue it further.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I set up a transfer from my First Technology Credit Union savings account to a joint checking account I share with my husband. The amount was {$2100.00}. For this transaction, I downloaded and installed the mobile app and proceeded with the transfer to the joint account.

When the funds did not appear in the joint account, we realized that the funds had been transferred to a First Technology Federal Credit Union account that we were unfamiliar with.

Upon calling the bank, they informed me that the transfer had gone to my son 's First Technology Credit Union account. I likely accidentally selected the wrong account probably because it was at the top of the list in the mobile app. I'm not completely certain. The account was linked to mine even though we had not gone through the steps to connect them.

First Technology Federal Credit Union refused to pull back the funds from my son 's account. They told me the only way to do this would be for my son to go in person to a credit union associated with First Tech, give them the account number the funds should have been transferred to so they can transfer them back, or else to get a cashier 's check and mail it to me. My son lives in another state, is mentally ill, and does not have transportation to get to the credit union. After explaining all of this, they then proceeded to try and sell me on opening up a low interest loan or credit line as I am a premium customer. This just doesn't seem right."

Student loan,"I am in the PSLF program with XXXX and I requested that Navient revisit my loan payment of XX/XX/2012 as they report it as short. Sallie Mae took over my Direct Loans without my approval inXX/XX/2012. In XX/XX/2012 I received a bill for {$1200.00} that did not reflect my Income Based payment plan that I was on with Direct Loans. I called to have my bill recalculated based upon my income and I was eventually told my new payment would be {$390.00}. The representative also stated my first payment would be due on XX/XX/XXXX so I made my payment early on XX/XX/XXXX. The following month I received a bill for {$410.00} and paid it in full. The next month it dropped to {$400.00}. I have found out through XXXX that this payment does not count toward my 120 payments because the payment was not for the full amount. 
I can only assume the customer service representative only saw the payment for loan # XXXX and did not include Loan # XXXX. At the time I was not aware they were separate loans. I paid the amount she instructed me to. As you can verify from my payment history I have always made my loan payments in full and on time. I made my payment in good faith for the amount I was told was due. Obviously if the representative would have told me to pay an additional {$12.00} I would have done it. Unfortunately they did not provide a written statement reflecting the new amount due so I made my payment based upon their employees verbal statement of the amount due. I have submitted documents proving my case. Document 1 shows the original payment due of {$1200.00}. XXXX that did not reflect my correct IBR plan. Doc 2 clearly shows my payment of {$390.00}, no amount past due, and a XXXX payment due of {$390.00}. ( apparently this was an additional statement error that was then changed to {$410.00} ). Again I made my payment on time for the amount I was told. I should not be responsible for their billing errors. As I researched Navient online it appears this is a common practice.

I contacted Navient ( since they took over from Sallie Mae ) to try to get this issue corrected. They did not credit the payment as requested and I have included their summary as the last document. The bottom line is that I paid the amount that was requested by their agent, I paid it 2 weeks early, and when they billed me an additional amount ( above the statement amount ) the following month I paid that in full as well. Clearly I met my obligation for that to be a qualifying payment.I should not be punished for their employee 's mistake. As I am nearing the end of my PSLF program I am trying to ensure I have credit for all of my payments. With the uncertainty surrounding the program itself, every payment is crucial before the program ends so I really would appreciate your assistance in resolving this as soon as possible. I can be reached at ( XXXX ) XXXX or via email at XXXX.

Mortgage,"I have been attempting to work with Ally to get this issue mitigated and was promised a resolution at end of XXXX but it just keeps getting worse.

I was told I would be refunded the resulting overage to my escrow account. This has not happened. Nor was this overage reflected on my escrow true up statement for the upcoming year. Instead on Friday I noticed that Ally made 2 property tax payments this week - one was correct and the other was not due until XXXX. 
Instead of responding to my request for an update they made a reference to my XXXX information. I did not have a mortgage with them in XXXX. 
I am getting no answers from Ally. They keep mailing me the same information over and over ( literally the same printout repetitively ) and provide no updates."

Both accounts were paid in full and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

These accounts were sold and placed in all 3 credit bureaus as negative and open on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and both are still showing on my reports which are affecting a home purchase by lowering my credit scores."

We suffered through a hurricane and were given a hurricane forbearance, but XXXX lied to us about the terms of the forbearance and now we are in jeopardy of losing our home through foreclosure. We tried to apply for mortgage assistance, but XXXX is refusing to help us and say we can not afford our payments, all due to their mistake regarding how they handled the hurricane forbearance. They advised in XXXX of 2017 that they would take the amount postponed due to the forbearance and put it into the back of the loan. However, when we contacted them after the six months, we were advised that the total amount due was the six months and our regular payment. We are extremely frustrated with their process and representatives and afraid that we will lose our home through foreclosure. Also, they apparently approved us for a repayment plan and it was supposed to be mailed to us, however, we only received a request for mortgage assistance package in the mail. The representatives we speak with do not have a grasp of what is going on with our file and we do not have a single point of contact to deal with on our mortgage. We are not confident they are properly servicing our loan and we would like for your agency to investigate what they are doing."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Ive had an XXXX XXXX XXXX account since 1998. I had an interest rate of approximately 14.9 % initially that stayed that way for quite some time. Eventually, the card was merged with Citibank and it led to my interest rate being raised to 29 %. I paid this for awhile and decided to contact the card company to have my interest reduced due to financial hardship. I was denied any leeway on the payments or interest despite my long tenure with the card and asking for temporary assistance. I continued contacting Citibank to request an APR decrease but was always denied. Im still looking for a resolution to this issue so I can make my payments without further putting myself in a financial bind."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I had taken out a {$500.00} MoneyLion installment loan via their app back in XXXX of 2019. The most recent balance as of XX/XX/2019 was {$410.00} and change. The payment was submitted to pay it off out of my MoneyLion Checking account which is through XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
My direct deposit went into the account by XXXX XX/XX/2019 and MoneyLion holds the funds until my official "" check date '' which is Wednesday, XX/XX/2019 ( today ). By holding the funds they caused the payment for the loan payoff to be rejected NSF and returned, incurring a {$25.00} NSF fee. I contacted MoneyLion to explain that they money was there, but was being held by a loop hole that a lot of major banks use in their checking account systems. 
The rep initially stated he can remove that {$25.00} fee early in the call, which I thanked him for. He then later put me on hold and came back to state that since they sent my loan nsf to their "" internal collections department '' that he can't remove the {$25.00} fee, owning up to lying to me on the phone about what he could or could not do. 
He then suggested I pay the fee, then ask the next department to remove it, which I will not pay the fee as the funds were there, but were being held by MoneyLion itself.

The loan was from them, the checking account is with them and they held my money separate from my loan payoff in order to charge me the fees that I am complaining about. 

Also related to this issue was back In XXXX of 2019 I asked MoneyLion to  stop withdrawing my loan payments from my XXXX XXXX account as I was going to discontinue use of that account, they would not give me the option to change the payment source so I contacted XXXX XXXX, in which XXXX XXXX returned those payments back to MoneyLion. I contacted them and it was not until then was I able to update my banking information to my MoneyLion checking account for the payment.

They may report me to my credit bureaus for missing a payment which was in fact not missed, they just refused to take it from the account I requested. This issue violates Federal Law. If a consumer notifies a financial institution that they wish to stop automatic withdrawals, they have to honor that."

This company violated federal law and also failed to provide me with a copy of any viable evidence, bearing my signature, showing the said account is being reported accurately. 

I have made several goodwill attempts to have them clear up this matter and they have failed to respond beyond an auto response which has left my request unanswered. 

I have requested that the company validate the reported information with XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX XXXX and provide me with copies of any documentation associated with this account, bearing my signature. In the absence of any such documentation bearing my signature, I formally requested with the company in a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that this information be immediately deleted from the credit file they maintain under my Social Security number.

I also documented with the company at the beginning of the investigation that I did not consent to e-oscar or any means of automated verification.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There are inquiries about an mortgage and car loans and a couple other unknown credit card companies that are not being inquired from myself and I have a concern about the research information that I obtained in regards to my credit report and I have to say that after I received the letter from the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and them saying that my personal sensitive information has been compromised by the web payments regarding some credit cards and payments due by 2020 and I have never tried to get a mortgage or a loan for a house in all my life and I have been trying to understand why I have been asked questions about my credit report and been told that they could not identify me giving the information I provided, which is the correct information for my life and my own actions. But because I didn't answer the questions right that means that someone is using my identity and my credit report for their own benefits and I don't have a clue what to do about the situation and the legalities regarding the situation as being a person that has been a victim of identity theft and my son as well. My deceased father 's veterans affairs have been breached and I have been left behind in regards to the changes that I was supposed to look forward to after my father 's death, I was not mentioned as his youngest daughter and I have been trying to get the details from the SSA and the VA.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I had two capital one accounts and still do, this incident happened over two years ago, my daughter suggested I try filing a complaint through the CFPB because Capital One is not willing to properly resolve my dispute. They have taken no measures to contact me or resolve as I previously filed a dispute through creditkarma.com and still the issue has not been resolved. I never opened two capital one accounts I just opened one but for some reason I show as having two capital one cards with two separate online profiles and it is just really wacky. I it is strange because I had set up my online profile with Autopay and would have done so with both cards had that been set up correctly but because CapitalOne failed to mention that these are two separate profiles not even attempting to combine them in any way to help the consumer. As I kept going to the one online profile and making sure auto-pay was set up. There is no reason for me to be late on a credit card. I pay off my credit and the online profiles should be together, after all it is the same company. I have one credit card separately and the other with my auto-loan. Mistakenly not realizing that the one account was missing I thought that the auto-pays were being sent. Until I got a bill then I just paid by check but got a late fee. I called to make the payment but not after being penalized with a credit report ding in XX/XX/XXXX. This repeated as when I would call capital one they would confirm that I do have Autopay enrolled and that it would draft the next time. I called again in XX/XX/XXXX after while as I new I had made purchases during the holidays again, and they said that it had not drafted then I got another late fee ( which was reversed ) and a credit reporting ding. I stopped using the card because I was so confused I went online. Then again I made a purchase in XXXX and this time I called them to make sure and they confirmed again, little did I know that I actually had two capital one cards that looked the same when I thought I only had one so that is why I would see that Autopay was enrolled and then another payment incident happened where capital one switched me to online statements and this was in XXXX of XXXX. I fault myself but also feel that capital one should take ownership, I have asked them to combined my profile since these incidents but they do not do. I am not happy with the level of customer service that I received because they did not think to check my other account for auto pay feature. I think they should have done it and set it up on the phone while I was on the phone with them."
Mortgage,"Mortgage service company Wells Fargo has not sent a form XXXX. They send paper statements monthly but apparently I need to access form XXXX electronically. I went to access the account online as I have done periodically. They have made changes to the online access and I am not able to access the account. In trying to resolve the issue, I have done all the various routines, including forgot username, forgot password, set up electronic access, and called them. When I called, they told me to enter my username as all caps and they would then require me to create a new password. This also did not work. They told me to use XXXX XXXX which I also tried and this did not work. There was no resolution. 

I have also tried to simply enroll using my SSN and the mortgage account number from a statement but it says it does not recognize my information. 

I don't know the situation as to the online access being disabled. I speculate it was related to the access through XXXX being transitioned to another mortgage servicer "" XXXX '' provider. In any case, this lack of ability to access my account or get it resolved, and lack of access to my XXXX is unacceptable."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I spoke to two different representatives at TransUnion XXXX XXXX XXXX in reference to a recent drop in my credit score of 35 points with a decrease in my debt of over {$3100.00}. Upon speaking with the two different representatives, they could not explain why my score dropped 35 points. I also have a excellent paying on-time record without negative impacts to my score. I immediately requested to be transferred to a supervisor. Upon speaking with a supervisor, she could not provide me with any information that would explain what had happen. The only thing that she said that made since was that they use a electronic scoring device that might need to be changed or could need some updating. She also told me that if I had a complaint, I could notify the CFPB ( this company ) and she had given me the number to the CFPB. With this drop in my credit score, ( that I have worked so hard to pay off my debt and kept paying my payments on time and sometimes paying over the monthly payment amount, paid off several accounts in full ) shows me that the more I pay the lower my score. That is absolutely not so! I would like a full investigation of this matter so that I will get an accurate credit report in the future."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I went on XXXX XXXX and noticed my score had gone down, went to check out why and seen something from ic systems and XXXX XXXX XXXX ...

Credit card or prepaid card,"My XX/XX/XXXX Capital One credit card statement showed my balance was {$3200.00} with a due date of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid the balance in full ( {$3200.00} ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I was assessed an interest charge of {$40.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One customer service to inquire about the interest charge since I had paid the balance in full by the due date. The first person I spoke to said she could not determine why I got the charge and then consulted with someone else. One hour later ( put on hold numerous times ), the other person told me that interest was charged from the time the statement came out ( XX/XX/XXXX ) until the day it was paid off ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I then asked what the purpose of the due date ( XX/XX/XXXX ) was if interest was going to be charged from the day the statement was sent and not the due date. The rep said I had been under a 0 % interest rate for 12 months but the promo expired on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked how I would've known that interest would've started accumulating that day and not after the due date as it is with most companies?? She advised it should have been in the welcome packet I received in XX/XX/XXXX ( over a year ago ) when I opened the account ; she said they don't provide any notifications on the statements. She refused to remove the interest charge and when I asked to speak to someone else regarding the issue, I was advised I would have to call back and get someone else. I then called back and asked for a supervisor again who also refused to remove the interest charge. I explained I thought it was a deceptive business practice to begin charging interest on the date the statement was sent and not after the due date. I then requested to close my account if that is the way the company operates and is unwilling to credit an interest charge ( that should've never been applied ) for a good customer. They promptly closed my account without trying to retain me. I do not think it is fair for me to have to pay the interest charge and am requesting it be removed. I would've paid the balance in full on the day I received the statement if it was stated that I needed to. I never pay interest fees on any card. I feel the way they are handling this promo and interest rate period is very deceptive and an easy way to get unsuspecting customers to pay an interest charge as soon as the promo ends."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I made a payment to Discover for {$32.00} ( payment due date ) on XX/XX/ 2019. On XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX I get a email from Discover stating that my account has been closed because of another collection account. So i call Discover that morning and spoke to a agent regarding the matter, and I was placed on hold while she spoke with her supervisor. Once back on the phone she informed me that I would have to give them 24 hours to look into the matter and to call back XXXX XXXX 2019 before XXXX XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/, 2019 and spoke to someone and was transferred from department to department ( given the run around ). I was once again told several times that my account was closed because of a previous account that has been charged off. I was then transferred to a supervisor which in turn transferred me to someone in another department named XXXX. Once XXXX got on the phone he ended up transferring me to some company called XXXX XXXX XXXX ( which does business with Discover ) and spoke to a lady there which placed me hold after getting my name and social. Once someone got back on the phone it was a male agent now, which asked me for the same information that the previous lady asked for ( name and social security number ) and he informed me that I am not showing up in his system and he cant help me ( company that handles Discover collection accounts ). so I called back to customer service and was connected to XXXX in XXXX Arizona which switched the story and told me that my account was closed because of Discover system ( a late payment ). I told her that she was giving me an excuse and her own opinion of why my account was closed and that I have spoken to several agents that made it clear why my account was closed. I was transferred to someone else and they gave me a phone number to another department and transferred me to that department. Once connected it was the right department after all ( after 8 different agents and 3 phone calls later ), and was told that my account was closed because of an account that had been charged off. But once investigated I was informed that the account in question whoever the person is has my first and last name, and date of birth but a different social security number and that I was right that the account is not mines."
Student loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I was hired at the XXXX XXXX XXXX and shortly after, I noticed student loan payments being taken out of my pay. This is my error, of which I am deeply embarrassed, but I did not know it was a garnishment of wages, rather than a monthly direct payment. The balance according to their records was {$23000.00}. I contacted the loan servicer, XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, requesting a lower payment and this is when I discovered that the LAST 5 YEARS of payments were made under a garnishment. The conversation was if I made the payments for the next 3 months on time I could get a smaller payment ( from nearly {$400.00} to less than {$200.00} ). I was also told in that conversation that if I had a total of 120 payments on the books on time, I could probably get the rest forgiven. My loan was transferred to Navient, effective XX/XX/XXXX,  where I have faithfully made my payments. Between XX/XX/XXXX and now, I had read on the website about loan forgiveness that you had to start one year before your 10th year to  begin the process. In XX/XX/XXXX, I went online, downloaded the form to begin the forgiveness process and mailed the form in. I received a response that my loan was not in the database. I called the phone number given, and a rep named XXXX ( # XXXX ) confirmed that my loan was not in the database and transferred me over to the Public Service Forgiveness Department, where I spoke to a rep named XXXX ( # XXXX ). XXXX confirmed that my loan was not located there and she explained that my loan was not a Direct Loan and that if I requested it at that time, I could begin the process of another 120 payments for forgiveness. I told XXXX that I made payments monthly to Navient and those loans were labelled "" consolidated '', and asked what it meant. XXXX replied that was another kind of consolidation and did not qualify as the loan forgiveness qualification process. I am XXXX years old. I have faithfully paid on these loans for 10 years and then some, beginning back in XX/XX/XXXX. It is mind-boggling that I would pay two 120-payment segments on original loans, totalling {$6500.00}. Mind you, I knew nothing about  the loan forgiveness part of student loans until XXXX told me about them. At no time did XXXX say that I had to do anything besides make the 120 monthly payments. Similarly, I do not recall reading anything about putting in a request to change my loan to a "" Direct Loan '' in order to qualify, else I would have done it ; all of this time I believed I was in compliance with achieving forgiveness status. If you count the payments I made beginning in XX/XX/XXXX, I have paid on this {$6500.00}. Surely, you have recouped what was owed and more by now."

For some reason a bankruptcy has been reporting on my report on XXXX and I am working with them to get it removed. It has been removed from XXXX and XXXX. It was a dismissed bankruptcy, nonetheless, it shouldn't be there. On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a Discover Secured IT account so that I could start rebuilding credit. I have an installment loan reporting but I needed a secured card. I applied and I was denied. When I called to ask why, they said it was because of the Bankruptcy. I took it for what it was. Well then, in one of my credit groups a young lady said she had gotten approved for an unsecured discover it card and she has a bankruptcy that was discharged in XXXX. So now that I see this, I really want to know what is going on and what is the real reason that I was denied. Is it because Discover doesn't like me? What is it? I don't understand.

Vehicle loan or lease,"Byrider Financ, LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX, OH XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a XXXX XXXX XXXX from the above company, with the understanding that I was buying it at fair market value, But 3 years 7 months later they still say theis is close to {$3500.00} still owed on the car and I've been paying {$170.00} every two weeks since the loan was taken out, On XX/XX/XXXX They repossessed the car they financed On XX/XX/XXXX I paid what was owed at the time of the repossession plus two weeks in the amount of {$1000.00}. 

After the money was received I was given a phone number of a towing company which would not take my call saying their lot closed at XXXX XXXX XXXX. So I have been unable to contact the lot where the car is suppose to be. 

They sent me a receipt for the payment on XX/XX/XXXX, stating that it would be at least 7 days for the car to be returned. That was in order for them to put a tracing device on the car so they can keep track of where the car is. I am pretty sure that they already had a tracing device on the car or how would they have known where the car was when they repossessed This was my only way back and forth to work and I have had to rely on someone to get me back and forth to work for the past three weeks. 

They did not give any for warning they were going to come and get the or I would have removed several items of importance to me from the car. 

Then on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX they e-mailed me to let me know that a payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX. I feel that this was very inappropriate as the car is not in my possession yet they want a payment."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX  deducted 24 points from my credit score last month and I can not get a reason for this change from them. They had no reason to deduct 24 points from my score. I am filing this complaint to get this solved.

I have been working hard to get my score higher and I have been paying my bills on time and should not have any deductions from my score.

This goes on continually and there seems to be no one monitoring what the credit reporting bureaus are doing.

I want my score reviewed and my points returned and updated like they are supposed to be. I also want to know if race is a factor that is used to rate credit, since I know algorithms are utilized to manage our credit scores and is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations designed by man.

Thank you. XXXX XXXX"
Mortgage,"On XXXX XX/XX/2020 I attempted to make my normal monthly mortgage payment through the lender web portal with XXXX XXXX XXXX Southwest Stage Funding , LLC. The payment came back "" denied by bank. "". I called my bank and explained the problem but they assured me the problem wasn't on their end and there didn't seem to be any issues with my account. I called the lender back and explained this however they said they could not fix it since now my account had a block on it due to attempting to make repeated payments. They also said that they were showing invalid account number on their end which is bull because I had just spoken with my bank prior to calling them to make sure I was inputting the correct ACH info ... which was saved anyhow under my XXXX  XXXX profile and had been for over six months. They then said that they would have to mail me a form to fill out to unblock my account and that I would need to mail them a check or other form of payment since they don't accept debit cards. I was pretty angry but did as instructed. I had a cashier 's check for {$930.00} drawn up at my credit union and then sent it certified mail to the address Southwest Stage Funding gave me. This was done at XXXX on XXXX XX/XX/2020. It also cost me {$28.00} to send it two day Certified Mail. I called them as soon as I got home to request that they call me as soon as they receive and process it. It is now XXXX XX/XX/2020 and as of this afternoon, they are saying they still don't have it. The only reason I think that they are screwing with me is because I have an open refinance loan with a different lender at a much lower interest rate and monthly payment. I think they are giving me the run around on purpose. Something needs to be done ASAP. My payment has never been late and the same account info that is saved on their web portal is the same account info I have been paying with for the last six months without issue, on time. My payment will officially be late as of XXXX XX/XX/2020 and will incur a large late fee and a potential credit score hit all for  something that isn't my fault."
Student loan,"XXXX XXXX  issued an intensely high and very aggressive loan for a XXXX college- XXXX XXXX  XXXX college XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to myself. All portions of the loan were not discussed nor did I sign any type of promissory note. The loan application indicates they provide quarterly interest statements. 

In XXXX I began receiving calls from a loan company called Navient stating i had to pay back over XXXX dollars and my payments would only cover my interest. 

Upon further investigation I found that the loan that was dispersed to me personally was in fact a private loan that had been misrepresented to me by the school and XXXX XXXX. 

I have tried to work with the Navient company and they refuse to work with me in reducing this debt and also discussing why 10 years this loan was allowed to accumulate interest with no communication with the original company."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In early 2018, I was purchasing shirts at XXXX XXXX. I wanted to use my XXXX 's card, which I've had for many years, to access a discount. The saleslady looked at my XXXX XXXX card and said it was really beat up and old and I should get a new card. She said she could update my card *and* give me a bigger discount. I said sure. She handed the phone to me, someone asked me a couple of questions, and I got the bigger discount. 

Long story short, I only found out when I had a 'past due ' amount, that XXXX 's had actually opened an entire new account in my name. I evidentally had TWO XXXX 's accounts. One I didn't know about and thus hadn't paid. The other completely up to date. 

I complained to the XXXX. XXXX 's said they'd fix it. They did not. 

What they did made my credit rating plunge. I had *literally* perfect credit. After the XXXX  complaint, they shut down my old account, thus making my length of credit history plunge. This, plus their reporting of my account as delinquent, caused another plunge of 50 points on my credit report. 

This is fraud in it's purest form. I didn't ever want a new XXXX 's card. They secretively did this for some reason - do they get some kind of kickback from XXXX XXXX ( the company running the new card? )"
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I was approved easily for a small {$500.00} loan as part of the MONEY LION PLUS PROGRAM and paying XXXX a month - I have no problem with that as I'm working to build my credit score while on a humble XXXX income I had to turn to 5 years ago as my condion worsend.. 
Hower part of the money Lion plus program was they also deduct from my account ANOTHER {$79.00} -broken down into XXXX as a monthly membership fee and a XXXX into a "" investment ' '' account - The loan I can handle ... 
My complaint is the other XXXX that is almost double my loan payment -- it's tightened up my budget beyond being doable in life needs - since the other XXXX is really my money voluntary put in a investment - I called them, and asked to close my membership, send me The XXXX ( built up in "" investment '' ) that's mine, OR put it towards loan payment - seems fair and morally even I pay what's lended to me They said no way ... it will ALL continue till loan payed.. 
I payed down to XXXX and WILL pay THAT- they refuse to stop deducting the other XXXX monthly out of my account that's Not part of loan repayment - I told them I'd call the bank and stop the ( ACH ) deduction that was the member / investment part - They replied - "" they'd give me a negative mark on my credit score EVEN if I kept paying loan BUT didn't pay other deductions that are MY money, not loan ... 
An extra XXXX might not seem like alot to some, but when your paying up past LEGIT bills to improve credit score, while living on tight budget, it all helps - but even with my personal life not included, there unwillingness to allow me to close account while still paying loan is my complaint to this organization. 
Thanks for reading and any help that can be offered."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Curious about my credit score, I obtained a copy of my credit report. Upon examination of the report, I noticed that there were some inaccurate items that should not be there. 

After sending certified, return receipt letters on XX/XX/18 ( which were received on XX/XX/18 ), reporting that there were inaccuracies on my credit report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, account # : XXXX, claiming that I owe {$6500.00}, I requested that I would like some type of verification bearing my signature to verify the debt. I never received any type of verification of any kind. All that was sent to me was a letter saying that the supposed debt had been verified and that it was accurate according to them. 

Waiting over 30 days ( which is how long that is legally allowed to verify any disputes ), I then sent another letter on XX/XX/18, which was received on XX/XX/18 ( again, certified with return receipt ), stating that I had still not received verification of any kind, let alone any type of verification that was bearing my signature, as I had requested. Upon checking my credit report, the non-verified, inaccurate item is still on my credit report, causing a negative effect on my credit score, as well as public humiliation throughout my local community. Since no verification of any kind has ever been sent to me or provided, I am seeking that this particular inaccurate claim is removed immediately.

Not only has no information bearing my signature ever been provided when requested, but is also Violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act - including but not limited to Section 611, such as : -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) -FCRA, Section 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) Depending upon how this matter is handled, I will also be detailing any potential issues via an online public press release, including any documentation of potential small claims action."
Mortgage,"I began two loan applications on XXXX XXXX, 2017 with XXXX XXXX XXXX located in XXXX, CA. One loan application was a purchase of a new property and the other was a refinance of an existing property. XXXX XXXX was my initial loan officer and everything proceeded smoothly until the file was sent to Underwriting on XXXX XXXX, 2017. I was told on numerous occasions that everything was 'in order ' and moving toward funding as scheduled, as I had provided all necessary documentation to the lender promptly and accurately during the review process. The lender was well aware of my scheduled Close of Escrow date of XXXX XXXX, 2017 and I was assured that nothing else was needed and that both loans would close simultaneously on, or before the scheduled COE date. A week before close of escrow, on XXXX XXXX, 2017, XXXX assured me that both loans were being Approved and closing on time. On XXXX XXXX, 2017 XXXX called me to inform me that the appraisal was 'waived ' in error by the lender for the refinance application and they were scrambling to have the refinance property appraised. I received an email for both the Processing Manager, XXXX XXXX, and the Director of Customer Service, XXXX XXXX, that they had made mistakes and that the loan process for both applications were delayed. On XXXX XXXX, 2017 I received an email from XXXX XXXX that they were making an 'exception ' and waiving the appraisal, the same appraisal that was supposedly delaying my loan to begin with. I am now 7 weeks into my loan applications and have yet to receive any decision on either loan, despite the verbal assurances that I would be approved. Not only are they in clear violation of Regulation B, but I have had to appease a furious Seller and negotiate a $ XXXX/day fine for every day that my purchase loan does not close.

This put me in a bind because we would have to start all over again. Plus the agent told us to save our mortgage money and now we are behind in XXXX, 2015"
Mortgage,In XX/XX/2018 Fay Servicing contacted me about being 6 months behind on my mortgage payments. I spoke to XXXX XXXX at Fay Servicing about this and I told her that was wrong because the payments were being taken out of my bank account automatically every 2 weeks for the past 2 years. she told me that the records on her end showed I was behind 6 months so she needed to see my bank statements that shows the payment was being taking out and she wanted me to fax her the statements. I faxed them to her and when she received them she said it didn't matter that we still showed we were behind and our home was going to be put on the auction block if we didn't give them XXXX XXXX XXXX which ballooned to owing them XXXX XXXX XXXX which I didn't have on hand. In XX/XX/XXXX they also stopped the automatic payments and would not accept any payment unless it was the full amount they stated we owed. I collected my bank my statements from XX/XX/2016 to current which showed that they had been getting there payments every 2 weeks. They were not interested in the information and proof of payment I had. In XX/XX/XXXX we tried making our payments but were unable to do because they had blocked any payments from going through. my house was put on the auction block in XX/XX/2017. mean while I was getting the funds together so we wouldn't lose our home. our home was 12 hrs from being auctioned off when I finally had the funds in hand to save my home.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I am a victim of identity theft. I have been getting calls and letters for credit accounts that I did not authorize. Some criminal has used my personal information to open credit accounts that I did not authorize. To open these fraudulent accounts banks accessed my credit profile and created unauthorized inquiries on my credit report that further defiles my credit profile. This criminal activity has caused me and my family extreme anguish as we try to rectify this situation.
Vehicle loan or lease,"In XXXX of XXXX the process of repossession of my car was started for falling behind on my payments on my loan with Santander Consumer USA Bank. I immediately paid the past due amount on the loan before the tow truck driver even had the car hooked up. So while speaking to a customer service rep at Santander that very same day, Miss. XXXX, she agreed to waive the repossession fees that they were going to charge to my account because I handled the situation in an expedited manner and brought the loan current immediately. Now, in XX/XX/XXXX I've made the final payment on the loan, and the loan has been paid on time since that incident in XX/XX/XXXX, but they have over {$370.00} worth of fees still open on the account for this repossession in XXXX/XXXX. The fees they promised to waive originally. I've since disputed these fees with a customer service rep, in early XXXX of XXXX, asking her to go back and review the recorded conversation I had with Miss XXXX that day in XX/XX/XXXX. She claimed she had no access to those records and told me that if I don't pay them that they will adversely effect my credit reports by reporting me as being 30 days, 60 days & even 90 days past due on the loan. The loan is paid off. So today XX/XX/XXXX, a representative from the "" executive offices '' of Santander Bank called to speak to me about my dispute. She too claimed to not have access to the call I had with Miss. XXXX stating they don't keep those records more than a year or two, yet she had records of a conversation I had with a Mr. XXXX that took place BEFORE my conversation with Miss. XXXX. The executive representative then acknowledged she had the ability to waive the fees from my account and offered a {$50.00} reduction to them. I told her I wanted all the fees waived as I was promised by Miss. XXXX. She refused and so I asked what will happen if I continue to dispute these fees and don't pay them, she replied they would report it to the credit bureaus as unpaid and open and adversely effect my credit. At this point she then said "" I won't be waiving any fees for you and I'm notating your account that way as well ''."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I hereby file this complaint as the servicer of my student loans is once again destroying my overall credit rating without provocation. As you can see from the several postings on all of my credit reports, the problem is very simple to understand. XXXX XXXX XXXX has the worse history in dealing with the public. My payment history would show a perfect payment history, then suddenly in XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX they would report up to 11 student loans as an immediate 60-days late, then up to 120-days late for several months, then back to paid on time. All of these loans were deferred and were never in a payment mode. Then once again starting in XX/XX/XXXX they would report all loans as 60-days late, all the way up to 120-days late, then a paid on time rating. All of these loans were always deferred, and now I am consolidating what remains on student loan obligations so that I can finish up my XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is destroying my credit history. XXXX XXXX XXXX has a contractual agreement with all three credit bureaus. That agreement, called a subscriber agreement, is very clear that the credit reporting entity must abide by the rules and report properly. This is not the case in this matter. XXXX XXXX XXXX is not only destroying my credit, but at the same time they are violating my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This practice is nationwide where XXXX XXXX XXXX has no concern for the general public. I need this to come to an end, and I need the late payment history deleted completely. I have once again filed a hard copy complaint to XXXX XXXX XXXX, but I anticipate that they will do nothing to clear my payment history. I will follow through with complaints with the Office of Attorney General, Commonwealth of Massachusetts next. I need my payment history fixed immediately!!!"

There is also an account open only on Equifax again of a balance of {$570.00} that I have never received a bill for, but is showing it was opened in XXXX  this year. I have disputed these two account with Equifax and sent them proof of bankruptcy and they still have not changed the status of the accounts even though I have received confirmation emails stating the dispute was completed. It is almost impossible to receive information regarding this situation because it is impossible to even receive access on their website because their system can never accurately match my information to confirm my identity and their phone number wait is always backed up hours at a time because no one can access their online features. Equifax should not be a trusted agency for being responsible for people credit information."

On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from my XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  stating that this debt was discharged.  Bloomingdales discharged this debt in XXXX and has fraudulently back dated the form to reflect they discharged in XXXX they have sent me this form late and also the amount on this is wrong since the items ordered were never received by me.

Mortgage,"On or about XX/XX/2019, The Money Source ( TMS ) acquired service of the mortgage on my home. At that time there was an outstanding hail damage ( roofing ) repair to be made, first half of the insurance check to cover repairs had been released by my previous mortgage service provider XXXX. Due to weather and backlog, our roofer did not complete repairs until early XX/XX/2019, at which time my wife began to make attempts to have TMS to begin their procedures to close out this repair and pay the roofer his final check. Following two weeks of attempts, I had to once again give TMS permission to speak with my wife as now they state that I can not give verbal permission over the phone and must do so by mail ( given different stories on how to go about this by each person I spoke with ), anyway after giving what TMS said is last time of verbal permission, their representative told my wife that they do not have the funds from the insurance claim nor have any knowledge of this, as well she was told that we would have to figure out where the funds were. I specifically spoke with an agent from TMS in XXXX concerning this claim and my concerns about this going smoothly, I was assured that after a period of about 30 days funds would be ready for release following inspection of completed repairs. My wife and I have both spoken to an agent from XXXX who states that funds were wired to TMS, however XXXX has yet to provide proof, this has been going on since approximately XXXX XX/XX/2019. Repairs on my roof are very close to 30 days past, at which time the roofer may choose to submit a lien on my mortgage, which will affect my credit. Check amount is $ 4,600+. There is no record available to me anywhere indicating where these funds are, as if they just disappeared. I am beginning to suspect insurance fraud by means of asset diversion. I do not know or have proof of which company ( XXXX or TMS ) has these funds, I do know that my wife and I signed the insurance check and submitted it to XXXX upon recipt from our insurer. As our current mortgage service provider, TMS should be providing assistance with getting this matter settled and to prevent a lien being placed on this property."
Debt collection,"I pulled all 3 of my credit reports, and my husbands reports to find out what was showing on them, as I hadn't done it in a long time. I was shocked to see accounts that we do not recognize, including companies I've never done business with. One of these was : AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT. The address LISTED ON the credit report is : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WA XXXX. They're reporting 3 separate accounts on our credit reports, and we have NEVER done any business with this company, signed any contract with this company, or even know who they are! Upon calling the company, they could not even FIND our information, or the account that they're reporting on our credit reports. I was advised by an attorney to send a "" Validation '' Letter to them to validate the debt under the FDCPA and FCRA. Under the law, they had 30 days after receiving the validation letter to respond to my letter and validate the debt that they're reporting to the credit bureaus. It has now been over 70 days ( they had 30 days under the law ) and they have NOT sent ANY kind of validation of this erroneous account, for both my husband and myself. Please note that before sending the validation letter to this company, I also sent a dispute letter to all 3 credit bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), and my husband did too, and AUDIT AND ADJUSTMENT has NOT removed these account from our credit reports, or have sent us any kind of validation. I request for this company to remove these accounts from my credit reports immediately, as well as my husband, as they have not followed the law, have reported inaccurate information on our credit reports, which carries a {$1000.00} fine, as well as FDCPA Section 809 ( b ), which carries a {$1000.00} fine for not validating the debt and still continuing to report it on my credit reports.

Student loan,"I requested a change in repayment plans. Apparently, MOHELA lacks the ability to process these requests efficiently. As such, it places the account on a "" processing forbearance '', in which it unilaterally delays payment for a month and capitalizes the interest ( referencing the right to do so under the master promisory note ). At no time did I authorize this or accept this. Nonetheless, MOHELA continues to forward me mail indicating its intent to capitalize interest. This is unacceptable without additional information and/or a refusal to cite to the provision in my master promissory note that authorizes such behavior ( i.e., at no time have I authorized MOHELA the right to capitalize interest on my account ( s ) ). 
MOHELA 's forced forbearance and capitalization is a MASSIVE class-action lawsuit waiting to happen. Damages are calculable. Good luck! 
Do n't capitalize my interest ( or my wife 's interest for that mater ). 
What MOHELA is doing is the exact type of behavior the CFPB is trying to prevent."

Mortgage,"I am representing my client who has a mortgage with PHH Mortgage Services. In XX/XX/2019 her loan transferred servicing from XXXX to PHH Mortgage Services. As of today, XX/XX/2019, she has never received a mortgage statement from PHH Mortgage Services. She has also been denied access to her account on line at XXXX. She and I have continuously called XXXX, to spend an average of 1 hour on hold each time, and we are only able to speak with the collection department.

The total amount due is {$1700.00} ; therefore, an additional {$1100.00} is required to complete your payment. '' On XX/XX/2019 the borrower paid {$900.00} towards the arrears. Now XXXX Mortgage is stating that the suspense account only has a balance of {$900.00}, where as the balance should be {$1400.00}, with a balance due for XXXX in the amount of {$580.00}. PHH 's collection dept. states that she needs to pay {$880.00}. The true balance due for XXXX, and to bring the account current is {$240.00}, not the {$880.00} as they state.

I returned to the store on the XXXX to find that the points amount had still not been loaded so we called customer service at Synchrony Bank again and was then told that there was a "" glitch '' in the system and some customers funds had not been loaded and I should check back with them in about 14 days from the date of issue of my letter. 

I called again on the XXXX, exactly 14 days after the date of the letter and now they tell me to just keep checking because they don't know when the "" glitch '' will be fixed. 

I phoned again today XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the funds are still not loaded to my card and again they tell me to just keep checking. Not that it should matter how big or small, but my reward amount is over {$1400.00}. I asked them if they would be paying me interest ( 25 % ) on my money that they can't seem to release, because this is what they would be charging me on an unpaid balance. I also asked them if they could simply send me the check in the mail as in years past, but they said no they could not do that. 

Surely I am not the only customer this is happening to and I don't care how they resolve it, I just want a resolution soon. Can you please help me?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX  opened up account FRAUDULENTLY IN MY NAME. XXXX XXXX XXXX needs to REMOVE ALL inquiries and balance FROM ALL THREE credit reports : XXXX, EQUIFAX and XXXX."
Mortgage,"On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX I made arrangements with the so called Sr. loan officer at Fortren Funding located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX to refinance my mortgage and ever since then I have been complaining because they think their swift in covering up costly numbers for their clients and am fully on to their scheme in robbing innocent families with outstanding credit, then destroy them with phony personnel. It started when XXXX XXXX told me to stop making payments to my current lender at ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX at this point XXXX XXXX  stated to me to let my new LENDER know that they will not pay my taxes for the 1st quarter. I let XXXX know about this and at first it was OK. and after mid month I received a late payment from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then contacted XXXX and XXXX XXXX another sales manager who went over my documentation to clarify my credit history and sign docs to qualify for the loan and had an XXXX credit score.So I cancelled ... This is when XXXX contacted me and said "" no '' don't cancel because it was only a matter of my tax payment that the title company refused to pay up front for me to start my escrow account. However, we can start the process again the following month because there is still time before my 1st quarter taxes were due and I will submit the same contract again with no closing cost to you and don't worry about the late fee because you are still saving 2 hundred a month to keep your 2nd home. I said "" please put this in writing and e-mail me that info ... and he did so ''. XXXX then instructed a Title company named XXXX XXXX XXXX at the time located in XXXX nj to arrange documentation on what we discussed And when XXXX XXXX arrived to my home on the evening mentioned XX/XX/XXXX she arrived with the HUD and we signed documents together as well as an unpaid hospice bill that appeared under my Dad 's name before he passed away in XXXX and simply had this removed from damaging my credit by notarizing that I was solely XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX ... And discussed like XXXX had mentioned to me that "" although he said, "" that there is no additional closing cost..there will be 500.00 from out of pocket expenses for the title agent and other fee if I can come up with XXXX with a cashier 's check to meet the tax deadline, since I will be skipping 2 monthly payments and receiving a disbursement check "" from my old lender ( XXXX XXXX ) for the amount of 1900 and change but not until LATER in XXXX since my old escrow account is being washed. and there we go XXXX stated, I also asked XXXX about the XXXX being the tax deadline and questioned how taxes were being paid and XXXX stated, they had to be escrowed into mortgage account from title company for recording and mentioned that it's a refinance and a few days late will not effect anything maybe a few extra dollars. He also told me to remember that we were brother 's being that were both from the same town 1 mile apart. At this time XXXX told both myself and my girlfriend that this cashier 's check is strictly for my tax payment and nothing else and attached it with the 1st payment letter on the HUD and mentioned again "" for taxes only! '' as she held it up to us. And this is where it does get tricky because the actual contract on the HUD realize is the original contract from when XXXX then XXXX stepped in as the Sr. loan officer to service the majority of this loan, XXXX or known as XXXX started the contract to approve my loan. So being numbers were left the same from the previous month evidently there has been a history of confusion and me and my family had to sacrifice over what XXXX had mentioned was a HUGE mistake and would have this problem handled ASAP for me when I contacted him by XX/XX/XXXX and asked him why only partial payment was made towards my taxes? I contacted him a few weeks later and told him that my taxes were still due but not delinquent and will have to pay on my own since I had a ton of money at that time. XXXX and my township asked why should I if I already escrowed them? And my town stated that they will put a yellow sticker on? XXXX said he checked again and they would be paying them soon. By the following year of XX/XX/XXXX I was receiving odd e-mails about unauthorized payments from my checking account for late payments from XXXX XXXX located over seas where all negative information was recorded to my credit history as well as the unpaid lien that was from my father 's and had to pay numerous penalties and fees for this error. By XX/XX/XXXX my car payment drastically increased along with my mortgage payment costing me an extra cost of living of 300.00 per month with an escrow shortage and canceled credit card. When I contacted XXXX he asked me who paid my taxes? I told him XXXX and he did not say anything but he will get back. I called again and this is when he disconnected his phone. I finally called in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to anther man XXXX XXXX who I never met and would not know what XXXX and I actually arranged. So he stated that he was taking charge of this loan and took a look at it and asked if this was a no appraisal fee and skipping 2 payments I said yes. he then asked me if I received a disbursement check? I said yes, then XXXX asked what did I do with it? spend it! I said yes towards my 1st 2 voucher payments made to fortren funding in the amount of XXXX when my payments were less than that amount and ended up with an escrow shortage after the 1st analysis came due from the negligence from the originators from what I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX and went directly to a credit service then sold to them delinquent after contacting their ombudsman dept. XXXX then told me it was too late to make any changes and not to have no more contact with them because no one is here to help me except my current lender who ever they were because my loan got all screwed up. By the time it was then sold to XXXX XXXX   my current lender I was and have been facing more escrow shortages, late payments diminished credit score and had to sell my second home and became XXXX because I thought this was a temporary mishap. And having no choice than to pay the losses to avoid losing my primary residence. By the summer of XXXX I was facing XXXX losses and submitting many complaints but the damages at that time were not severe enough for me to pursue and I received a phone call from a third party at Fortren Funding XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX and he told me that XXXX is no longer available to explain how this loan fell out of my favor and would be too costly in court with all of the banks handling my loan and suggested that I request a loan modification where that would reduce my interest another point and any liens that were recorded would be forgotten and that none of these consumer complaints believe me because the XXXX messed up the paperwork. I knew that this was another false misrepresentation so I reported all of this to my current lender. I also did contact other authorities. An experienced Sr.loan officer with my credit history and the HUD presented to them is self explanatory with the 48th month history if examining, the timing of the disbursement check which I was accused of spending towards my taxes ... HUD 1 settlement statement lines XXXX fees XXXX line XXXX taxes ( XXXX  ) XXXX XXXX with tax certificate showing that taxes were open for XX/XX/XXXX on the evening at closing. And the payoff to my former lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) At this time of course everyone involved has avoided any involvement in this criteria and are probably out there in other offices after closing down. Hopefully this will give a clearer picture how these people who can not maintain their own lives, careers and jobs, families etc.It 's the people who work hard like my father did and I who have outstanding credit and a work history of 39 straight years in the work force until I had to work harder at XXXX years old for what started as a simple mistake. And myself being a homeowner 2 telling me how to  handle my money ... hopefully justice is served for all of them!"

At any rate, Capital One sided with them without proof on my end that the company did in fact, in writing, state that a deposit was due to me but as of date I still did not receive the funds. The agent at that time told me he would put in place that they would not go back in to retrieve the money back from me. Weeks later as stated Captial One took the money back from me in my claim. Recently, I paid my rent at my NEW apt to then be told my funds were returned due to me putting in a stop payment on the transaction. I stated to the company I would never stop my rent and they conference called with me and Captial One with Capital One stating nothing was wrong with my account and they merchant never did a transaction to retrieve the funds. The merchant suggested for them to do an investigation as they had a transaction ID to proof they tried to retrieve the funds. Captial One got back to me the next day admitting they incorrectly gave me the wrong information as they put a stop payment on the transaction as coincidentally the NEW apt community uses the same payment system as the OLD community. At that time a manager stated they fixed the situation and that the merchant could go back to retrieve the funds. A couple of days later the NEW community told me again that I placed a stop payment which I did not. We did another conference call and we were told yet again they had nothing in place to prevent the funds from withdrawing. After being transferred several times, we found out that the lift was never done and the merchant suggested that even though a fee will be assessed with it, for me to make a debit card payment which went thru. As a result of Capital One 's mistakes, I was assessed a late fee of XXXX and two {$50.00} Non sufficient funds from my NEW apt community as well as was placed on the eviction list there which needs to be paid by XX/XX/2019 which Captial One was told several times. I also assessed a {$26.00} fee to pay by debit card. Because of what has happened I asked for my account to be closed SIX times which they have not done so as of yet as well as letters of explanation to be sent to the NEW apt community and my lender as I am trying to buy a home which has not been given to me as of yet in addition to proof of what they used as a deciding factor with the OLD apt community on why they sided with them without my proof which has not been given to me yet as well."
Credit card or prepaid card,"on XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a prepaid netspend card from XXXX XXXX. I loaded XXXX dollars onto the card and payed the XXXX for the activation fee separately. The card advertises that one can set up their account in 3 easy steps. After adding my ss # I was directed to customer service and asked to upload my documents. They wanted me to upload pictures of my drivers licence, s.s card and proof of address just to activate my card. I was told it would then take up to 14 business days to allow me to have full access. I told them thats ridiculous and why are they asking me to verify these things for a card not yet activated or attached to me at all whatsoever at that point. 
I felt they were trying to steal my identity using my money to do so. Eventually 3 days later I contacted a supervisor who told me she would just refund my {$300.00} minus a {$15.00} dollar fee for the refund. 
She said it would come to my address in a paper check. 
I verified my address and verbally gave my information over the phone. 
It matched up with my previous reported info they had in they're system. I was told just wait for it to come in the mail via ground shipping in just a few days. 

2 weeks later XX/XX/20 I called back to find out that the check was sent to an address that does not match mine and my name was mispelled as well. 
Again I was asked to upload my documents to have this issue fixed. 
After arguing for half the evening and repeating my issue to 4 different employee 's I was transfered to escalations where I could barely understand the employee through the obvious language barrie. 
I was told it would be fixed and I can call back for the update in 3 business days. Its again been weeks. Everyday is a struggle trying to get through to somone now. I can't get past the automated system to a live operator. The automated system requires me to enter my card # but my card was never activated therefore its not valid. The system automatically disconnects once my card number pings back invalid. On XX/XX/20 I was able to reach a supervisor for netspend who literally hung up on me when I asked why a financial institution would send my money to the wrong address and misspell my name when the very info required for verification is indeed correct in their system already on file from a previous prepaid netspend card!

I have over $ XXXX in retirement accounts. I have not started taking money out of the retirement accounts because I have other money available that has already been taxed. My current rent is {$3300.00} per month. I have the cash for the down payment. The loan amount is {$500000.00}. The P & I plus taxes and insurance is estimated to be just under {$3000.00} per month. My wife and I qualify for {$3900.00} per month in social security starting in XX/XX/2020. There is absolutely no risk that we wont be able to make the payments on the loan. We have very low debt and great credit. In our past history of home ownership we have never missed or had a late payment. I was told that their underwriter has stricter rules than XXXX XXXX and that was why we were denied for the loan.
Debt collection,"On Monday, XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted me 4 times in reference to a debt that I owe to XXXX XXXX  XXXX. The first time that they had called me, I did not say "" hello. '' The representative called my name, but I didn't respond. From there the representative called me a second time and left a voicemail message. The representative, by the name of XXXX, called me back twice more after that, which I have proof on my cell phone. Actually, I had to block his phone number due to his continuous calls. 

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX back. XXXX proceeded to explain that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had placed a lien on my house for a {$17000.00} loan for an HVAC/central air conditioner, which I never received notice about. From there, XXXX aggressively stated my place of employment. He told me that according to the contract that I had signed that if I had defaulted on my loan and XXXX had a right to place a lien on my house to collect the {$17000.00}. I told XXXX that I did not have the {$17000.00}. He asked what amount I could pay. I told him that I didn't know, since he is the debt collector he should be able to give me an amount. I also said if a lien was placed on my home, then, why should I have to pay the loan back? From there, XXXX placed me on hold. The call was disconnected, but I had called XXXX back. XXXX told me that I had to pay {$4000.00}, which is 25 % of the loan. I told him that I didn't have that amount. XXXX asked what could I pay. I told him I didn't know. I told XXXX that I never received anything in writing or a letter from his company about this debt. XXXX also became agitated because I had asked him to explain what a lien is. XXXX became annoyed with me and began screaming at me over the phone. I told him that he was being unprofessional and he hung up the phone on me. I called XXXX back and he continued to yell at me. I called him unprofessional and an XXXX. I stated that if the call is being recorded then why is he being so unprofessional. Then, XXXX mentioned how my spouse 's name is on the contract and he would verify his employment the same way that he verified mine. XXXX stated that he would enforce that the {$17000.00} be paid by any means necessary. Then, he hung up the phone on me. 

Afterwards, I called XXXX XXXX and explained what happened to me. I spoke with a supervisor by the name of XXXX. I had explained that I had to pay an IRS debt, which is why I fell behind in payments. XXXX stated that my loan was charged off and her company couldn't really help me. She said I had to deal with the debt collector. I told her I could probably pay in XXXX, but I didn't want to deal with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained to XXXX that I didn't trust giving the debt collection agency any payments because the representative was so unprofessional. XXXX stated that she would reach out to XXXX  XXXX  XXXX to see if I can deal with another representative. 

I need help with this situation. The representative yelled at me, hung up the phone on me twice, attempted to intimidate me by mentioning my job and contacting my husband and harassed me by calling me 4 times in one day."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been trying for almost three years to have XXXX XXXX XXXX and/or Experian remove this information from my credit report. XXXX XXXX XXXX does not list correct contact information at Experian. It appears through an internet search that both Experian and XXXX XXXX   XXXX have been aware of this issue for years and done nothing, even in response to prior CFPB complaints about XXXX listing this very PO Box in error, or deliberately. In the attachment, please see the Experian report dated ten days ago listing XXXX 's address. Compare that with the US Postal Service rejection letter saying that the XXXX XXXX XXXX "" moved and left no forwarding address ''. Now compare that with a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX provided to me through contacting another aggrieved Experian Customer that also wrote to this address and had the dispute letter returned ... date XX/XX/2016. That person also complained to XXXX and the CFPB about this particular address being incorrect. This is willful negligence on the part of Experian and this is actionable .... possibly class action. Experian, please ask your counsel XXXX XXXX for their opinion before a lawsuit gets filed."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX XXXX  on behalf of Clarity Services appears on my credit file as a pay day loan company in which I have not applied or requested no loan on loan. It seems to be some scam going on with XXXX   and Clarity Services to get people to do on line pay day loans. I'm filing a complaint with the US Attorney as well as the UD Justice Department on Clarity and XXXX and XXXX XXXX. There seems to be a pattern with Clarity Services on my credit report I'm opt out for promotional or marketing on my credit file. XXXX  seems to be violating my OPT out rights. I'm not trying to her no XXXX about this and that.
Checking or savings account,"The subject of this complaint is PNC Bank. During the second week of XX/XX/2018, I transferred {$300.00} or so from "" XXXX XXXX '' to "" PNC Bank '' and received an email about four days later saying that the money had been received in my PNC account and would show up within three business days. To date, I have contacted PNC via online chat a week after I didn't receive the funds, then called four times, reached out by email and phone to an executive client relations person at PNC two weeks ago. I still see no funds in my PNC account. It's been almost a month now, with no sign of the funds showing up in my PNC account -- even though PNC confirmed that they've been received, and they were taken out of my XXXX  account just fine! 

I am contacting you so that PNC checks its own records and properly reflects this {$300.00} received transaction in my account. Right now it is essentially stolen by PNC or XXXX -- I don't know. The documents I have attached clearly tell the whole story."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been a victim of ID theft and have submitted documentation to the credit bureaus and they are refusing to abide by FCRA 605B pertaining to my request. The original creditor - XXXX XXXX, has no proof other than statements, and I have constantly refuted this charge by submitting proof of my ID theft claim. 

I am reporting a complaint of the credit bureaus consistent harm to my financial efforts because they will not block the account on from my credit report as I have requested. I have been disputing this account for over a year and have decided to move forward with bringing my issue here."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Compass bank continues to lie and slander my name and not focus on the events that lead to this complaint. In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to Compass Credit Card Department to indicated that I never received the card. I was then told the account was closed because the could n't properly ID me. Per the manger in the credit card department if I can go to a local branch and they can ID me and call in to verify me that they will reopen the account which took place. The XXXX CA Branch can verify that this took place. My focus is on the account # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX reporting to XXXX XXXX that I attempted an unauthorized transaction. First I want to point out that compass just confirmed in there response that my account was opened which contradicts them saying the transaction was unauthorized. The transaction actually took place on XX/XX/XXXX and I took a convince check from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX into a local branch in XXXX CA. I asked the branch what is the best possible way to handle a balance transfer. The branch told me to write out the check to myself and deposited into my checking account. Being that the check is a credit card product before it could be deposited the branch would need to call over to the credit and authorizations department before it could be deposited because the system is flagging it for approval. After waiting about 5 minutes the teller was on the phone with the department and came back with an approval and said the funds where available in my account for immediate use. With all that said compass is reporting for misuse on this account with XXXX XXXX but they already confirmed the account was opened and the transaction in question was approved in branch via credit and authorizations department. Compass keeps focusing on transactions that has nothing to do with the XX/XX/XXXX reporting. When the transaction was made on XX/XX/XXXX my credit card and checking account was opened. Compass then closed the accounts after the transactions were made which would make it an legitimate transaction not what they are reporting. Please investigate the XX/XX/XXXX transaction and correct my XXXX XXXX reporting."
Mortgage,"My mortgage was purchased to Mr. Cooper ( Nationstar ) from previous lender Seterus, Inc. Once I received notice from the Mr. Cooper , it also included a past due bill that indicated I was 50 days late and missed both the XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 payment. My house was in jepordy of foreclosure. In addition, the principle balance and monthly payment had increased. Upon my initial inquiry I was told the payments from the previous lender must not have been transferred over correctly. I submitted 2 years of payment history to SeteruXXXX from my XXXX XXXX XXXX on line banking to Mr. Cooper. It is impossible to reach the research team, they do not interface with customers. My claim was denied according to a customer rep even thought I showed them proper payments. Each day I speak to someone new in their customer service department and continue to get different answers. They have since reported delinquent to my credit reports, and continue to tack on fees. This company 's inaccurate reporting, threats of foreclosure and increase of my mortgage principle is terrifying. You can not get anywhere, I was left with no choice but to pay the amount in dispute that I have already paid, since they threated placing a lean on my property. It is not fair, the reviews of this company are terrible, I am at a loss of what to do."
Debt collection,"Early XX/XX/XXXX i was taken to an emergency room in colorado via ambulance. 

At the time i was uninsured but was told i could be retroactively covered via colorados healthcare/XXXX. 

I applied and was accepted to the program within the time frame. It later went to collections and i was served with a summons to XXXX County Court in XXXX, Colorado by the collectors in XX/XX/XXXX. I filed a response and a motion for trial was set for XX/XX/XXXX. During that period i provided the plaintiff ( the collection agency and their representatives ) with a load letter officially stating i was covered for the costs incurred in XX/XX/XXXX. 

A motion for continuance was requested as they billed medicaid. On XX/XX/XXXX the case was dropped as the situation was resolved. 

In XX/XX/XXXX i checked my credit report via XXXX and noticed i had a collections appearing. This was part of the collection that was solved and should not have appeared. 

On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX MST i submitted a dispute with the credit agency XXXX  including the letter saying my medicaid covered it, the official case dismissed paper signed by a judge, and the original summons complaint. 

On XX/XX/XXXX i was told the dispute was unsuccesful. 

"" The company that reported the information has certified to XXXX that the information is accurate. This item was not changed as a result of our processing of your dispute. Please review your report for the details. '' Because the collection agency still said i owed. I did not. 

Today, 1 year later from the end of the litigation the account still sits on my experian report. I called the agency and then they said "" oh yeah it should be closed '' todays date is XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have been hurt severely due to this unjust appearance on my report. Seeing this false report lenders are rightfully skeptical of lending to me, and even if they do it is at astronomically high rates."
Mortgage,"I have lived in my home for almost 43 years. 
I began writing my history of how everything led up to the problem I am going through, but I know that you may be interested in specific facts. 
My most current problem is that even though I have been going through a short sale, and the first bank that I owe called XXXX XXXX, was working fine with my buyers, Chase, the secondary loan bank, which was actually a predatory loan, back in XXXX  or XXXX, ( I had just refinanced, in order to fund a group of people who were going to work together to buy and flip houses ) The same Chase loan person called me and said that I had so much equity in the house, why don't I get a Home Equity Line of Credit, I told him that I didn't need it, but he said, well you have all this equity, any time that you need anything you can just write a check. I agreed to it. But did not touch it until I wanted to help my daughter with a vehicle she had purchased, and the plan was to pay me monthly instead of paying high interest. That didn't pan out. 
Okay, so, Chase, who in a short sale would normally get a small amount because the first loan would get the bulk of the short sale, began demanding more money and creating delays in the short sale. I had gone through a chapter XXXX Bankruptcy last year, and just no longer had enough income to pay around {$400.00} to settle both loans. Also, and this has been a very big injustice, even though I tried to modify the loan with XXXX 5 times, at least, kept me at 7.5 % interest, even though President Obama had put out that banks should make it easier for homeowners. They still have me at 7.5 %, and so the debt goes higher and higher. I have adjourned foreclosure many times, and now because of Chase, demanding more, XXXX has taken the short sale off the table. I am XXXX years old and had a very XXXX XXXX XXXX of the XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  being XXXX. I was planning my future to have some moving expenses made available to me through the short sale. Now, the foreclosure is coming up on XXXX XXXX, and I have no money to put 43 years of belongings into storage. 
I endure XXXX  XXXX  XXXX, but I keep working as a XXXX XXXX. Chase has been present at the scheduled foreclosures in order to bid on my home. I believe they are creating this short sale problem to be able to get the home through foreclosure. XXXX XXXX attorney has pretended not to know this. 
I was my mother 's caregiver for 9 years here in this home. My father, XXXX Veteran wanted to stay here, but he moved out and my brother cares for him. 
I have documents to support what I am saying."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Nobody will listen. I've complained and disputed this information several times. 
Please quit validating this INCORRECT information with XXXX. 

Edfinancial is not reporting my history to XXXX   correctly. The other two bureaus are ok. 

1 : Edfinancial is reporting to XXXX  that I was current XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I WAS NOT CURRENT. 
No payment was made those months nor was I in forbearance or deferment. Refer to account history directly from Edfinancial ( attached ). 

2 : Because this account was negative when it was closed, Edfinancial needs to report a Date of Original Delinquency to XXXX. Right now, the date XXXX   is using is XX/XX/XXXX. THIS IS NOT RIGHT. 
The date of original delinquency should be XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced in the account history directly from Edfinancial."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Please substantiate your claims regarding information XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX transmitted to credit CRAs for me, XXXX XXXX, regarding a so-called account # XXXX, # XXXX, # XXXX, # XXXX, # XXXX. Since reporting errors may be vis-a-vis that reported data, I formally request that you mail this validated information within 15 days. Additionally include documentation which shows that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX complied with every aspect of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act or other applicable laws. This request is for more than just a summary without in-depth consideration. In lieu of that, I have asked for an in-depth verification. If you can not forward these materials within 30 days, details disseminated from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXto the credit bureaus should be deemed discrepant and may indicate XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX desire to ignore consumer protection law. Given that occasion, remove such bureau items upon your next transmittal."
Student loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I was forced into a forbearance, I made less then {$10000.00} in the year for both years. I was told this will just freeze my account solid till I was able to get back on my feet financially. In XX/XX/XXXX I had to reapply, where I learn that I accumulated over {$10000.00} on the loan as an increase of not making payments. My statements would come in a zero. And no one, no one ever explained that this will accumulate interest. 
I was told that it was an account freezer, that my account would stay solid at that price till I was able to get back financially. In XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I sent in my taxes to prove that I am below poverty still making {$10000.00} in a year. I was told I would have to do IDR, and as I get my emails to know my payment amount, I could never sign in to navient. I had been locked out of my account on how many attempts to add my social and my birthday with the website stating I never had an account. Finally I call to talk to a representative, all for him to tell me my account had expired in XX/XX/XXXX. How can a federal government payment program expired your account, but still demanding you to make repayments. Navient lied to me over the last 5 years, as I tried to show valid income information to receive lower payments, they made me go into deferment and forbearance instead of offering actual payment options. Because of this my loan increase went from {$10000.00} loan to a now {$40000.00} due to interest, when I provided my low poverty income wages for years."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am writing to complain once again about Toyota Motor Credit. Below you will find my original complaint and their response. I feel that their response is still unjust and I will continue to file complaints until they take proper action. The fact that they can damage my credit report negatively for 7 years over one written attempt which I did NOT receive is absurd. As the co-signer on a lease with Toyota Motor Credit how can it even remotely be a fair practice to collect a debt through one letter and ZERO phone calls if that letter was not acknowledged. Now i'm left with a damaged credit report thanks to their lack of due diligence. I am right in the process of home buying and this is basically killed that. I want Toyota to take responsibility for their lack of attempt at collecting this debt and REMOVE this unfair charge-off report from my credit report. They claim they are are required by law to report accurate information and I would hardly describe their attempts as and this "" Charge Off '' as accurate. You have the power to remove this do so! Otherwise, i will continue to complain, and even seek legal representation if need be for such unjust business practices and reporting. Hardly the intent of the FDCPA to say the very least."
Checking or savings account,"Woke up Monday XX/XX/XXXX to find my savings account had been reduced to nil. Two withdrawals of {$1300.00} and {$2300.00} were made at a banking center in XXXX, Fl. I live and operate in XXXX. I have never been to or know anybody from or heard of XXXX. I did not lose my card or give out any information. This should be impossible. Bank of America told me it can take 60+ business days to resolve. That is three months and is unacceptable. It is my emergency fund and prevents me from needing a credit card. I provided every detail BoA asked of me. This is so obviously fraud I can ' understand why they won't credit me the money back while they investigate what happened."
Debt collection,XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX capital one sold the debt to XXXX and I had a contract of 12 payments XXXX a month or pay off the balance before the 12 months. I finished paying XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX. And now capital one just sold the debt to XXXX XXXX   again. How is these even legal? My balance XXXX. Settled. Credit file show s I owe {$2900.00}. How could they sell the debt two times? Two different companies how is this legal?
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/18, I attempted to make a mobile deposit in my checking account with XXXX. Because the amount exceeded the mobile deposit limit by {$340.00}, I called support and asked for an increase. They told me that they did not provide increases above the amount I had. They suggested I cash the check elsewhere. The mobile app gave instructions for deposit by mail. It listed two addresses, one was a PO BOX , and the other was for overnight delivery. I endorsed the check and mailed it out two-day priority mail to the overnight address. 

Using the tracking number, I discovered it was not delivered until Monday, rather than Friday as promised. On the app, the instructions for deposit by mail clearly state '' Once your check has been received, up to {$200.00} of your check deposit funds will generally be available within one business day. The remainder will generally be available after another business day. Check deposit amounts greater than {$5000.00} may be held for an extended period. '' So, I called on Tuesday, XX/XX/18, which was one business day after the date it was delivered since there was no indication that the check had been received. The agent I spoke with told me that she could not confirm receipt of the deposit, and she told me she could give me no time frame for how long it would take and that they would know it was deposited when it showed on my account. I asked could they not at least confirm it was received at the correct address. She told me that she could not. I asked what remedy I had and she assured me that it would be processed soon. 

I called today, XX/XX/18, a full two business days after they received it according to USPS, and the agent placed me on hold and told me that "" in her experience, it can take three business days before it is processed or shown in the account. '' I asked could she not confirm it with the processing center that the check was received so I don't have to worry that it was delivered to the incorrect address. She told me that she "" could not check with the processing center until 10 business days after the tracking number delivery date. '' So, I am going into XXXX without any access to my funds, and also without having any idea whether the check was received at the correct address. None of this information was available to me or I would not have deposited the check via mail. I expected to have access to part of the funds "" one business day after received '' as their app stated. This is insane that they won't even check to make sure the check was received until 10 business days after delivery."
Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I purchased a car with the promise of a 60 month loan term. The auto loan was financed by Capital One Auto Finance. Every document given to my by the dealership reflects a 60 month loan term. The dealer did not provide me with a copy of the Retail Instalment Obligation contract that the dealer assigned to Capital One Auto Finance. I am XXXX years old and believed I was about to make my last and 60th loan payment. Capital One Auto Finance insists that my loan term is for 63 months. In XX/XX/XXXX, I complained and Capital One Auto Finance sent me a copy of a letter that they allege was mailed to me in XXXX outlining a 63 month loan term. Capital One Auto Finance has not provided me with a copy of the Retail Instalment Contract. I do not know what kind of bait and switch tactic was used but there has been three ( 3 ) extra months added onto my auto loan in a very deceptive way. I was XXXX years old when this fraud was perpetrated against me in XXXX. How absolutely disgraceful to financially abuse a senior citizen."
Mortgage,"Due to the defective escrow calculations in my mortgage, the lender increased my monthly payments by {$450.00} a month, beyond what I can afford. To correct this problem I am attempting to refinance my mortgage since the six month waiting period mandated by FHA has expired. This refinance is time sensitive as it has to be complete before the lender pays the next property tax bill this month which puts the escrow account into a negative balance. 

To make this happen correctly, I contacted Plaza to get the automatic draft of the mortgage payment from my bank account stopped and the tax payment delayed. I was assured both verbally and in writing that both of those things had been done, yet Plaza still drafted the payment out of my bank account. This has put the brakes on my refinance as it has totally changed the payoff amounts and affected closing costs.

I have been in contact with Plaza several times over the last two days since they did this and am getting nothing but run around. They promise calls back that never come and can not provide any explanation at all as to why they can not just fix their mistake. Their actions, whether spawned out of complete incompetence or being done out of a willful attempt to prevent my refinance so they can continue to collect interest, are going to cost me a substantial amount of money."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","There is a bankruptcy XXXX  XXXX on all three of my credit reports, XXXX, Transunion and XXXX claim that the data furnisher for this bankruptcy is the United States XXXX  XXXX but I know that is incorrect, I contacted the XXXX XXXX where I live and I was told by the Clerck that the XXXX XXXX do not share or provide information to third party. I asked the court for the information in writing so that I can send it to the credit bureaus and be able to get that bankruptcy deleted. I received the letter in the mail, I sent it to all three credit bureaus and it seems like they ignored the letter and they keep telling me that the bankruptcy is accurate. I know that these companies get this information from another company called XXXX XXXX. The FCRA states that all information on a consumers credit report needs to be 100 % accurate. This bankruptcy is being reported inaccurate. This is a violation of the FCRA and it is breaking the law. I have included the letter from the Bankruptcy XXXX as proof."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I got a report for a job of my background screening results, and it shows that XXXX has me reported for collections for settled-less than full balance. It is not being reported under my bankruptcy chapter XXXX that was filed XX/XX/XXXX and Discharged on XX/XX/XXXX. Bankruptcy case # XXXX. THIS ACCOUNT WAS INDEED INCLUDED IN MY BANKRUPTCY. I need this resolved in a timely manner because i am submitting a reconsideration employment letter to the company that has denied for employment because of this mistake. Thank you. XXXX XXXX IS USING TRANSUNION, so would like to get it removed from transunion and the other credit agencies if being reported as well."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted a complaint with CFPB. The complaint number is XXXX. 

The complaint was closed and stated that I was supposed to receive correspondence from TransUnion regarding how they verified information on my credit report. I have never received any letters or phone calls from TransUnion regarding my issue. 

I am requesting this erroneous information be deleted from my file as they have violated FCRA on multiple occasions. First they did not respond to my original request within 15 days and I have not received any information regarding my CFPB complaint."
Debt collection,"This company "" XXXX XXXX Asset Solutions LLC '' or ""  XXXX Asset Solutions LLC '' has been calling me for months trying to collect a debt from an estranged in-law that I don't even speak to and haven't spoken to in 8 years. When they first called and asked me if I know this individual I asked them who they were and they said a debt collection agency and I told them to not call my phone again. They continued to call and leave messages and I would block each number. I called them back and told the employee to take my number out of their system because I do not owe any debt and I don't know the person they're trying to contact. They called me back today from the number XXXX and told me to call them back at XXXX. 

I don't know if this is a scam or a legit company but they're harassing me. I do not owe them money. I have absolutely no debt and I'm not responsible for an estranged family members business."
Debt collection,"Thank you for taking the time to look into this complaint. I would like for CBE Companies XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IA XXXX. Telephone ( XXXX ) XXXX Contact person XXXX XXXX to provide me with a receipt of payments made to their office on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX for a disaster loan I received over 14 years ago for about {$5000.00} dollars. They have a lein on my check for almost 12,000 and I have paid them over {$9000.00} I am only interested in making sure this company is on the up and up. Which they obvious is not. If they were, they would have a copy of the letter from the XXXX giving them the authority to collect on their behalf. Also, they would be able to provide me with a copy of the payments that they received. I know that it has be a law requiring them to give me a receipt of the payments they are collecting on behalf of XXXX. They are the one collecting the payments and supposed to be forwarding to XXXX. They are tell me to go to the XXXX and ask them. SBA is telling me they can not talk to me, because it is in the hands of CBE. By the way this company has about 3 different address I have found so far. And not one of them can give me a receipt of the {$2000.00} cash payment I just gave them on XX/XX/2019 over the phone with XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX nor a statement of payment the amount they have received from my employer. This company has never sent me one statement, receipt or validation of this debt ever. Can they really do this? How much have the collected so far? And what is the balance to get this account closed? What company do business like this? They refuse to give me a receipt for payments. 

I have tried to contact XXXX and they refuse to talk to me because CBE Companies or or Group or whatever there name is this month who is supposed to be collecting the payments. By the way they don't even have a license to collect in my state of Nebraska. ( I have enclosed a copy of the license collection agencies in my state and the law. 

This company has a garnishment on my check. And I want to pay them off NOW. PLEASE GET ME A COPY OF THE PAYMENTS THEY HAVE RECEIVED AND THE BALANCE I OWE! 

I have not seen anything like this before in my life. You can't go to the local store and make a payment and not get a receipt, what makes them exempt from providing a receipt of payments they have received. I have contacted my attorney general office and they told them to have me go to a government website to get the balance. Of course that didn't work. They also said they will contact XXXX to get a validation letter of the debt. Shouldn't they have had they before putting a garnishment on my check? 

I don't know the law, but I know there has to be something governing this unscrupulous collection agencies practices. Isn't it against the law not to keep records of money you are receiving? No business is allowed to do that! 

They don't want to put anything in writing so they can go on and on collecting payments from me. My XXXX it has already been 14 years. I want this account paid off and closed ASAP. 

Please help me get a balance and after I pay them, a release letter sent to my employer that his account is paid in full. 

Thank you for all of your time in getting this debt validate with history of payments and final balance owed. Have a blessed day!"
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I was sold a puppy by XXXX. I was promised a Labrador named XXXX shipped to me for {$500.00}. The seller said he wanted me to use XXXX to transfer the money, and since my bank, Wells Fargo, offered this service, I felt it was reputable and would be a protected payment as if I used another service. After sending the payment, the seller said that I needed to buy a thermal crate ( between {$900.00} and {$1600.00} ) to have the puppy shipped in since the regular crate wasnt sufficient for the weather and the size of the puppy. I started asking questions and realized that this wasnt as advertised. I didnt send any more money but then asked the seller to refund my {$500.00} payment as I told him that I couldnt afford to buy a different crate. He said he would refund the money and then blocked my number. When I call him now, it doesnt ring and says call rejected.

Tax Preparer got an fake email ( pretenting it is from tax payor ) giving instructions for direct deposit for tax refund money from IRS and state into bank account. Fake email contained fradulent account number.

IRS has sent money to fradulent account but with Tax Payor 's correct name.

Even though there was correct Tax Payor 's name, Wells Fargo bank did not match the name on the ACH transfer and name on the account number so just deposited the tax refund money into fradulent account. 

If Wells Fargo matched the name of the tax refund and name of the account like most other banks do, this fraud have been stopped. But Wells Fargo Bank 's LOOSE policy of not matching the name We called Wells Fargo Bank to correct this transaction, ( just returning the money to the IRS ) but no action from them yet."

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/XXXX I received two emails from Wells Fargo stating that someone had sent money via XXXX to a person I don't know ( Named XXXX XXXX ). There were two transactions and two separate emails for each. 

The first was for {$1.00} at XXXX and the second was for {$250.00} at XXXX I saw the emails about two hours after they were sent and immediately called Wells Fargo to report the fraud and was walked through the process of locking down my account - changing my username and password, some other security measures for phone identification, etc. I was told the fraud case would be opened and I would have my money back in a maximum of 10 business days.

7 business days later I called them to get an update and was told that it was still being investigated, but that I would still have the money back in my account within the 10 business days.

Debt collection,"I have attached a copy of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau order of 2015 pertaining to the collection process on medical debts. This federal agency has levied millions in penalties against several medical collection agencies for abusive collection practices since the 2015 mandate that consumers must be granted 180 days-notice that any or all medical debts can not be posted against a consumers credit report. What this entails is that I as an American consumer needs time to either settle a medical collection before said collection gets posted on my credit report, or that my medical insurance carrier had enough time to resolve the collection either in full or by any sustained factoring agreement in place with the medical servicer, be it a physician, clinic, ambulance service or hospital. That has not been the case in the attached medical collection ( s ) posted on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectfully. Since the 2015 agreement between the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and all three credit reporting agencies, medical collection agencies have violated this agreement in its entirety. Having established that there is a specified procedure in place on medical collection postings on a consumers credit, it is a fact that most if not all medical collectors are in violation of their subscriber agreement with the major credit reporting agencies. Since my rights have already been violated by the collection agency stated in this complaint, the collection should be VOID completely. I am not disputing any factual conclusion if I was even given medical attention, just stating that my personal credit history has been damaged by an unlawful collection practice. I should be entitled to damages for the overall cost involved with what would otherwise be a perfect credit history. Accordingly, I respectfully request for the disputed medical collection ( s ) to be deleted permanently, and if this particular collection agencies needs a remedy for collection, it has abused the credit reporting system by violating my rights. In my opinion the only recourse at this time would be moving forward through other collection processes outside of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The disputed collection must be deleted permanently, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must sanction and fine the agency for its abusive actions. The credit reporting agencies should also terminate the subscriber agreement if place. My dispute is based on material facts and current policies on medical collections. The attached disputed collection ( s ) should be deleted permanently without any right to reinsert from this point forward."

Student loan,"While in college I utilized Key Bank for XXXX XXXX Loans in order to pay for tuition that was not covered by financial aid. Recently the loan servicer changed to XXXX. I had thought payments had been made to XXXX, however my cosigner received documentation that I have defaulted in the loans. I have received phone calls from Key Bank, but only during hours I am at work therefore can not answer the calls. I have no idea how to access the account through Key Bank or any other servicer in order to develop an affordable plan to get out of default. I need to keep in mind that {$600.00} a month already goes to federal student loan payments. I do not know the account number. My cosigner received 7 letters from Key Bank on XX/XX/18 that according to them were in a threatening manner. My cosigner is now elderly, has limited income and in a frail medical state therefore he can not be contacted especially when I have not been able to speak to anyone."

After checking the linked account I am paying the bill with, all of the charges displayed that they had been taken out. However, now I am out over 900 $ ( also included is an overdraft charge on the linked account used to pay the credit bill of XXXX $ ) Now USAA has over 900 $ of mine, hasn't returned my credit limit or my funds that they have TAKEN and has been cleared by my bank. I have no available credit, they will be charging me interest on the remaining balance and no access to funds because they overdrew my checking account at my other bank. Meanwhile, they said they have to hold MY money for 10 days. Whatever the reason, their system triggered this. They have stated there is nothing they can do, which I know is false. The credit limit I have is XXXX . And I have no explanation as to why this is even remotely acceptable. This is theft from a major corporation and there has been no attempt at resolving this.

I proved threw the bank, several faxes and emails that they took the payment out of my account. But they said they didnt get it so they shut my car off till I make anouther payment.

Vehicle loan or lease,"I received a bill for excess wear and use related to the end of a lease for a XXXX XXXX. The bill was dated XX/XX/2018. Upon review of the inspection report, I discovered significant damage to the rear bumper of the vehicle. There was no damage to the vehicle when it was returned and exchanged for a new XXXX XXXX. The salesperson XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took photos of the car when it was returned. Upon receipt of the inspection report and the bill, I contacted both Toyota Financial Services and the dealership. Both promised a review of the file and that they would get the photos from the salesperson to confirm there was no damage to the vehicle when it was returned. I emphasized to both parties -- especially since they insisted that I was at fault for not getting a pre-inspection prior to returning the vehicle -- that I was not told of the opportunity for pre-inspection until *after* I had exchanged the vehicle. Toyota Financial Services promised a call back from the escalations desk in XXXX hours. No call was received. Eventually, I received a revised bill which indicated that they had removed {$100.00} for "" excessive stains '' on the seats. The {$460.00} charge for the bumper remained. Eventually, after being unable to contact anyone at XXXX or the dealership to resolve the issue, I paid the requested amount to prevent further collection action. I then spoke with a representative on XX/XX/18 who indicated I had been misadvised as how to handle a dispute and that I needed to write a letter to Customer Service XXXX XXXX. I did as directed and XXXX never replied."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I made a {$1000.00} payment on my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( CitiBank ). On XX/XX/2019, I noticed that Citi had charged my account for interest on a purchase made using the card on XX/XX/2019. 

I started a chat session with the company and they said that it was a 'technical issue ' and that they would reverse the interest charges. 

My concern is that I do not trust that there was any technical issue at all. I believe that CitiCard / XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is willfully and knowingly charging their consumers interest - and playing the odds - that we won't notice. It is highly unlikely that their computers would randomly and mistakenly charge interest as a 'technical issue '. 

The amount was minimal, but it was wrong. I should not have to contact the company, wait for 11 minutes on a chat session for a proposed resolution. I should not have to police this company to be sure that they are not taking advantage of me. 

I am awaiting a credit reversal for the interest and will need to watch all future statements to make sure that I am not taken advantage of again. 

My complaint is being filed in an attempt to avoid others, who may be less diligent with their finances, from being taken advantage of and wrongfully being charged interest where no interest is due."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I thought I made my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment, but we received a notice that we had not. I called Quicken Loans immediately to resolve. I made the XXXX payment immediately and paid the XXXX payment as arranged. 

We have never missed a mortgage payment in all the years we have had loans with Quicken and the reason we missed this time is my husband was very sick. In XX/XX/XXXX my husband was diagnosed with XXXX XXXX, and went through intensive XXXX for several weeks. Then in XX/XX/XXXX he had XXXX, which took 8 hours and 2 XXXX XXXX to remove part of his XXXX, and all of his XXXX. The XXXX was rebuilt out of his XXXX  XXXX. He also had a XXXX.

He underwent XXXX about 2 weeks ago to fix the XXXX XXXX XXXX and he is speaking fairly well. 

I sent an email addressed to XXXX XXXX, EVP, Client EVP, Client Experience Operations on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a phone called from her assistant, "" XXXX, '' who checked into the situation, but she said there is nothing they could do because if the payment is one day late, a letter goes to the credit agencies. 

On XXXX I sent an email to XXXX XXXX, CEO, with the same complaint. A director in consumer relations ( I'm sorry but can't find his name ), called me and he explained that "" according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, '' Quicken is required to send a notice to all credit bureaus, no exceptions. 

Disregarding our extenuating circumstances, Quicken Loans sent a "" late payment '' notice to the credit bureaus. Our once good credit is now at rock bottom.

Mortgage,"We are filing this complaint against our servicer, RoundPoint Mortgage. We requested assistance with our mortgage payments due to unemployment, and was informed by RoundPoint Mortgage that we filled out a Uniform Borrower Assistance Form. We complied and returned the form on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage throughout the process. Later on, on XX/XX/XXXX, additional documents were requested by RoundPoint Mortgage by XXXX XXXX, and they were faxed to her on XX/XX/XXXX. We received an "" Evaluation Summary '' dated XX/XX/XXXX, stating that we had been approved for FHA 's Making Home Affordable Modification program. In addition, RoundPoint Mortgage included paperwork with these forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, for a letter of agreement for a trial period of 4 payments in the amount of {$1500.00}, due on the XXXX of each month starting XX/XX/XXXX, and ending with the 4th and final payment of the trial period on XX/XX/XXXX. The letter requested that we sign if we agreed to the terms sign and return the forms by XX/XX/XXXX, and we did sign them on XX/XX/XXXX, and returned the forms the same day. The payments were made according to the terms for the entire trial period. We called to speak with our "" point of contact '' ( XXXX XXXX ) until we couldn't reach her any longer and had to settle for "" the next available agent '' on a regular basis to get an update to the finalization of the modified loan agreement. We continued to receive billing statements that we were behind on our mortgage, but when we would call in about the statements, many times we would reach XXXX  and he would tell us not to worry about the statements, and that they would be corrected when RoundPoint Mortgage finished "" updating our account '' with the information from the documents they had received from us, and that we were to continue to make the modified payments of {$1500.00}.

On XX/XX/XXXX, we received a XXXX  envelope from RoundPoint Mortgage with the "" Loan Modification Agreement '' for us to sign and have notarized. We signed the forms, had them notarized and returned them via XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. We kept in touch with RoundPoint Mortgage for updates to the finalization of the "" Loan Modification Agreement. '' We received forms dated XX/XX/XXXX, about a week or so later, stating that we would find "" a fully executed copy of the Loan Modification Agreement dated XX/XX/XXXX. '' We continued to contact RoundPoint Mortgage about our account not being updated, and when would the account reflect the new terms. When we reached the next agent available, again it would be XXXX  sometimes, and he stated like others before and after him, that we should ignore the billing statements and that he sent an "" escalation request '' to his manager, supervisor or someone in that capacity. This continued through XXXX, XXXX and then in XXXX we received a letter stating that we were behind two months in our mrotgage payments. I called, XX/XX/XXXX, and was connected to XXXX. I believe it was at this time that XXXX  told me that there was a new modified payment and that there was a shortage in payments for the XXXX and XXXX   mortgage payments. Since I was still paying {$1500.00} instead of {$1500.00} according to him, there was a difference of {$26.00} for each of the two months in question. We paid the difference of {$52.00} to bring the account back up to date. I also asked XXXX   why was it taking so long to correct the statements. I stated that I felt that someone dropped the ball, but he said instead that no one dropped the ball on either end, but that there were a few things that needed to be updated. It was wasn't until about a two weeks later that XXXX told me that it had been a mistake ( s ) made on their end, ( RoundPoint Mortgage ), that was the cause of the stall with the updating of our account. In addition, XXXX  stated that we need to keep making the modified loan agreement payments of {$1500.00} and he was noting the account.

Then around the second week of XX/XX/XXXX, we receive a phone call from RoundPoint Mortgage about a lien being on the home and this is what was an issue, and that we needed to fill out a "" Non-Identity Affidavit. '' We did on XX/XX/XXXX and mailed and/or emailed it back with the requested proof from court to verify that there was a mistaken identity issue, and sent both documents back to RoundPoint Mortgage the same day. We continued to stay in contact with RoundPoint Mortgage on a bi-monthly basis and it was almost a month after they asked us to give them two weeks to get everything in order, that they tell us when we call in XX/XX/XXXX, that they sent in another "" escalation request. '' The representative stated that they were making a note on the account, and to continue to make the modified loan payments of {$1500.00}.

Recently, we received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX from RoundPoint Mortgage that we have been granted a "" Loan Forbearance Plan '' and that we are behind {$9900.00}. It included a request for us to sign the Forbearance forms and return by XX/XX/XXXX. We signed and returned the forms on XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke to a representative that told me we had to pay the late payments and the new mortgage amount of {$2000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, even though we were offered and accepted a Modified Loan Agreement in XX/XX/XXXX, and it was recorded with the county in XX/XX/XXXX.

We were given the excuses of an "" early payment during the modified payment schedule '' and that "" the debt wasn't reaffirmed before the debt was discharged '' as to why the modified loan agreement was, with no prior explanation prior to RoundPoint Mortgage finalizing the Modified Loan Agreement back in XXXX of XX/XX/XXXXwith the county."
Debt collection,"For the past 4 years I have been requesting additional information pertaining to my credit report and a collections debt with Diversified Consultants and the Collections agency would take it off without providing the information I would request but then it would reappear.I then reached out to Diversified Consultants and they told me I had to reach out to the original creditor which was XXXX and I was required by XXXX to send a notarized statement of dispute due to identity theft along with additional information stating that I was a victim of Identity theft. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent all required information XXXX requested. I included a copy of the notarized statement of dispute, proof of my address at the time the account was opened ( which I was told by the collections agency that it was XXXX but they could not provide a specific date ), a copy of my XXXX Tax Return ( which I was a resident of the state of Georgia when the account was opened according to the year they provided. ) and a copy of the police report filed on XX/XX/XXXX confirming that I was a victim of identity theft due to my wallet being stole in a XXXX parking lot in XXXX, Ohio. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  sent a correspondence stating that my fraud claim was denied based upon possible reasons concerning account information. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a request asking XXXX to verify exact what it was that caused for my claim to be denied so I could know what steps I would need to take next and also because it my right according to the FCRA to know and understand why I am liable for the debt when my identity was stolen. XXXX then replied on XX/XX/XXXX asking for a notrized copy of my ID and a copy of the police report in which I all required information again on XX/XX/XXXX. I recently received my most recent correspondence from XXXX Fraud Managing stating that my claim was again denied and it was the same denial that was sent on XX/XX/XXXX in which they provided me with no additional information on my fraud claim but only the reason why it may have been. this has caused me an extreme amount of mental and emotional stress and it has also caused me to be denied for many credit opportunities. I am sending in all documentation requested and they are sending me the same request each time. Can you please"
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 I went to the Bank of America to see about using an offer from them sent in the mail to consolidate high interest credit debt. They initially had trouble with the mailing 's code, but overrode it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I attempted to make a payment on a XXXX Visa card only to find that Bank of America had paid {$5700.00} to this card on XX/XX/XXXX without my authorization. I had not even activated the Bank of America account and had no intention of paying the XXXX account using Bank of America. I placed a complaint through XXXX  and Bank of America did not show proof of my authorization, yet they have closed the fraud inquiry. This has not been resolved to my satisfaction as they insist I abide by their ruling."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",The account was settled and the settlement amount was paid in full. I sent the information to Equifax and they have failed to properly verify the information and report it correctly on my credit report. The balance is XXXX  but they are still reporting a negative balance and stating it was charged off.
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I returned from a vacation to find a collection bill in my mailbox. I was shocked because I did not know about this outstanding bill. When I called the collection agency on XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that the bill was from service that was performed on XX/XX/XXXX. This was an XXXX  that I had for treatment of my XXXX XXXX. My physician had obtained a prior authorization prior to beginning the XXXX in XXXX of XXXX. During the conversation with the collection agency, the representative stated that he could see that I was not billed for the date of service except right after the service was completed in XX/XX/XXXX before it was billed to the insurance. The representative stated he could not see any additional bills being sent to me. As I continued to investigate, I found that the last denial from the insurance company was done on XX/XX/XXXX. The collection agency admitted that they had received the file from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX but did not send anything to me until the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 
The issues that I have with this is that I had prior authorization giving us the approval to have the infusions completed. The insurance denial on XX/XX/XXXX showed that the billing department did not include the authorization number and on XX/XX/XXXX the denial stated not deemed medical necessity yet I received prior authorization stating it was approved. The facility failed to bill the insurance with the necessary documentation allowing it to be paid in full. Because the collection agency sat on the bill for the 180-day parking time it took away my ability to appeal the claim with the insurance company and get the bill paid. Additionally, if there were any uncovered costs the facility was to bill it to the pharmaceutical company who would have picked up any uncovered costs but because of the failure to bill the insurance company the pharmaceutical company was unable to pay the uncovered costs as well. 
I am including with this letter the documents showing the approval prior authorization letter, the denial letters from the insurance company, additional EOBs showing different dates of services for the same infusion showing payment and information on XXXX XXXX   from the pharmaceutical company. I do not feel that we should have to pay this bill since it was an error on the facilities part in billing it to the insurance correctly as well as their delay in notifying me prevented me from being able to appeal it and get the services covered by the insurance. Also as soon as I contacted the Collection company they immediately placed it on my credit as a derogatory claim going back to the time that they received the claim in XX/XX/XXXX. 
Any help you can give me to get this claim off my credit and preventing the facility from pursuing this further would be appreciated."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","So I recently disputed several inaccurate items on my credit report on Experian. I disputed exactly how it is said to do and used factual information and attached documents to support my reasoning for what I wanted done. Out of the 8 items I disputed only one item was removed from my report. I have attached a copy of what was sent to me. I don't understand how you ask a person to be specific and then when it happens nothing is done. These are clear violations that are showing on my report. XXXX XXXX XXXX was the only account that was removed. On the attachment I am sending I have marked all the inaccurate and clear violations such as date of status not being updated to show that a investigation was even performed, late payments on accounts after the accounts are charged off and closed, and monthly payments on a account that are closed and sold/transfered but doesn't even state who bought the account. These are all violations and I have asked for these accounts to be removed /deleted from my credit report. On XXXX XXXX it shows late payments and I have never been late. I have asked Experian to provide me the paper work or a bank statement to show me proof that I was ever late. I have never received anything. I have also asked for documents showing my signature on a contract and they have not provided this information either. I am very upset because I am getting no where with these disputes and I am showing them that the items they are quote on quote verifying are being deleted by XXXX and XXXX so how is it still showing on mine after I have disputed. All the bureaus get there information from the same sources so why am I not getting the results I have asked for. I don't want a letter telling me I need to be more specific because I have attached my dispute letter as proof that I am being very specific in what I am saying and wanting done. I also want my personal information to be corrected to one date of birth, one social security number, one address, one employer, one phone number as I have asked and disputed as well."

This woman who messaged me asking to rent my place, she said that she would pay XXXX upfront and from that XXXX will be for my deposit and the rest XXXX, I had to send it to her movers. She wrote me a check for {$2800.00}, which I attached below. I added it to my account and when I saw the pending balance, I had sent her the money in multiple payments to some guy named XXXX XXXX, who is supposedly her movers. 2 days later when I check my account the check has bounced out and I message her that her check bounced out and tried calling her but she was using a textnow number ( fake number ). The text messages between me and her are in chronological sequence. You can see from my repeated text I sent in the screenshot below, where the check she mailed bounced, she didn't respond to my texts, I called chase freaking out to report this fraud because {$2600.00} is significant amount of money for someone who is a college student, and doesn't have much savings to my name, and now providing proof. Lastly when chase refunded me the money in the form of a credit, I was delighted that chase made things right for me. I messaged her saying I got my money back and she responded that I am happy you got your money back, proving that she did try to scam me. Also when I researched her name on XXXX she had sent the same text messages to multiple people, and scammed multiple people. I have provided Chase my bank with proof of all the text messages, the check she sent me, the screenshot of the check bouncing out."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian is refusing to tell me how the "" verify '' the inaccurate and unverifiable information on my credit reports. I have mailed in numerous request to Experian and they just keep saying "" verified ''. I have also contacted the creditors that are appearing on my credit files, and as of today, they have not responded to my requests as well. So if the creditors can not "" verify '' the information that I am requesting to me, how can Experian state that they are able to get the information "" verified '' in their system? This is a blatant violation of my rights under the FCRA."
Student loan,"I took a private loan from Navient ( Sallie Mae ) back in 2008. Initially I wanted to get the fixed rate but was advised by the finance advisor to go with the variable because the fixed rate was too high and I could change it in the future. I later found out when I started making payments that this is not true. 
Currently my monthly bill consist of paying 85 % interest. I am mostly paying the interest instead of the principal. Due to my current income, I am only able to afford the minimum payment. 
The interest they charge is ridiculously high and they claim there is nothing they can do about it. They also do not allow borrowers to switch from a variable to a fixed interest rate. The variable rate is never low and is constantly high. 
I contacted Navient and asked to be given the variable interest rates that I have been paying them, however they could not provide the information and told me that they will email me the information ( I have not received it ). Navient claims to have borrowers interest at heart, but this is not true. Not only was I misguided with information but they informed me that there is nothing they can do with my current payment set up."
Mortgage,"I am XXXX XXXX, I was contacted in XX/XX/XXXX in ref to the home at XXXX XXXX. Where my brother XXXX XXXX had lived until his death until XXXX of XXXX, I was informed of the mortgage on the home and asked if the family would be willing to take over the payments. I was informed that they needed a copy of his death certificate and a summary of my relationship to XXXX which I faxed. From that point, I would called Loancare to inform them that I had not received any paperwork and each call I started to get a run-around. I reminded Loancare that they contacted me, and was told my name was found in the file and now they have an issue with speaking with me. 
I received a phone call from professional services who informed me of the house being on a foreclosure sale and provided me with the name and phone of the legal firm involved. 
When I pointed out the incorrect information on the application and asked who assisted with the application, and accountablity in these actions. The family does not want the home sold and was told that they also could help in getting the payment lowered. I just want the packet sent and how do I make the payment of {$260.00}? I have spoken with my city , county government and legal aid. They all agree something is wrong. I feel that the family is being viewed in a negative light due to possible communication or behaviors from XXXX children, which the family has no connection with. Again, we/siblings are willing to pay the mortgage on our family ( parents ) home at XXXX XXXX."
Debt collection,"I XXXX XXXX along with my wife XXXX XXXX are in a position to file for a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy. However, as a means of pursuing a reasonable procedure to get out of debt over the next year without such a drastic step, we are requesting very low settlements in the 20 % range of where our debts were at the last payment. Accordingly, we believe that we only have one chance at this, and if we do not start receiving settlement offers soon, we will retain the bankruptcy attorney we recently consulted. Therefore, we request letters of settlement, and we request the cease and desist from all calls to our home, cell and/or work. We desire to resolve these matters in written form only. 

Thank you for your consideration in this matter."
Student loan,"On XX/XX/2019 I submitted all the correct forms and documents for my Income Driven Payment Plan including my tax return and pay subs which were all up to date and printed clearly. At XXXX this morning, I received a statement that the documents were not properly sent, the information was illegible and that I would have to file again. But when I called today at around XXXX XXXX, a service representative said that this time I could just write down my gross income on a blank piece of paper, in my own handwriting, send that in and it would be accepted ... They're going to take my word and a signature on a piece of paper to officially verify my information as an official document for my payment plan. When I asked if I could send it in the mail officially, the service representative seemed hesitant to let me do that. They are purposely prolonging the period so that I will have to pay the full amount. They are almost completely impossible to get a hold of. Whenever I send in documents like my name change and official documentation for that, they either claim that they didn't receive it, or it was ineligible. They have still not updated my name change, even though I have submitted that in early XXXX. 

I am tired of submitting the same documents, which are faxed clearly and are marked as received from my fax machine, only for them to say that they are processing my return two weeks later, and then replying that my loans have been denied for the same information two weeks after that."

I would like to know why my limit was decreased, since there haven't been any issues with my account?

They sent me information to mail the merchandise back to XXXX with electronic tracking. There is no electronic shipping out of the country for less than {$60.00}. The product was {$30.00}. Since sending it back is not an option I feel my only option is to place a complaint since PayPal won't return my money. I should be protected against scammers. The company misrepresented the product. PayPal should be responsible to their clients. I was set to send it before the XXXX of XXXX like requested but needing the electronic tracking finding out that it isnt even feasible to spend {$30.00} extra dollars to get {$30.00} back is ludicrous.

I have recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) requested for several paid off or closed accounts to be removed from my credit report.

Debt collection,"I received an email from this company, claiming to collect a debt for a payday loan. Not knowing what this was about I called them. Right, away, they said they were going to send the police and have me severed and possible jail time if I didnt take care of the debt. I am being scared and not knowing what to do, gave the person my contact, mailing, and email information. Just my own no one elses. 

The person ( XXXX XXXX ) told me that he was going to send me an email that same day right after we got off the phone and a letter to my home address. A few days go by and I did receive the email. I called the number on the letterhead and it was to a construction company, I then tried to locate the company online and contacted the BBB and no one has ever heard of this company. 

I called again but at a different time then the first time calling, and XXXX XXXX answered. I told him I didnt receive the email or the paperwork. He did finally send the email. In giving him my contact information, I had given him my debit card information after looking on the FTC websites and reading about scams I canceled and not knowing this company and not finding out any information about it. I thought it was best to do so. 

I called the original place I got the loan from and they told me that they have never heard of this company and told me they sold it to another company for which they gave me the information too. 

This was not the company ( on letterhead ) that was stated to me. In the interim of canceling the debit card, they had started calling my parents they did not get their phone number from myself. Telling my parents that the police are going to come and arrest me and arrest both of them too. I called them and told them not to call my parents. Both my parents are very ill, my mother is recovering from a double XXXX transplant and my father had a small XXXX XXXX in early XX/XX/2019. 

I told XXXX XXXX again when I called that I still have not received the paperwork that was supposed have been mailed to me. 

I called today XX/XX/2019 and again asked him why do they keep calling my parents and Ive asked you not to that you have my contact information and again that my parents are very ill, those calls are upsetting to both of them. 

I also ask for proof that the company was real because I have no way of knowing this and he got very upset with me in my asking. I don't know who this company is and they are not professional at all. But, most importantly I don't want them to call my parents anymore I'm so afraid that something will happen to them because of their harassing phone calls."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/13 I was scammed by a PayPal seller. I used PayPal credit for my payment.

They had failed to provide me with any copy of any documents bearing my signature, showing that I have a legally binding contractual obligation to pay them the exact amount claimed. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent another mail to the collection agency requesting them to delete this collection record from my report as the amount is incorrect and they failed to validate that this debt belongs to me, and haven't received any answers from them till today.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello, Today 's date is XX/XX/19 I have a First National Bank ( FNB ) of Omaha Orvis Credit with a {$3000.00} credit limit, which is paid off monthly. 

FNB allowed a transaction to be posted against my credit card which allowed my credit limit to be exceed. 

I have NOT opted in to over-limit fees so the expectation that any transaction is declined if there isn't enough available credit to cover it. 

I have contacted FNB and their representatives indicated have no hard stop of purchases that exceed credit limits as they find their card holders to be upset and they do not wish to have to communicate with them, so they allow over limit purchases.

I asked if I could have a hard limit set on my account and they said no, they can not do that.

I have contacted two ( 2 ) out of three ( 3 ) credit bureaus and they said that FNB should provide a later to sort this indicating FNB 's misstep. When this was communicated to FNB, they said no, they will not.

At this point, given the above I have to accept what appears to be a business practice of FNB that is in direct conflict with the "" Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act '' which indicates that over limit purchases should be declined."
Vehicle loan or lease,Me and my wife have been with this company since XXXX. We both looked at our credit report and noticed that our account with SNACC was closed due to no payment and payments. When me and my wife has clearly been making payments on time and every month. Other than when I was XXXX and I tried to tell them that and they still took the car. I paid well over XXXX to get the car back and now I see that on our credit report. We filled a despuit with the credit place and they came back to say the same thing. Now just this month we got an email that we didnt pay and it hit our credit again. They been doing this since XXXX. Now my car broke down and now we cant get into anything else due to our credit being low becuase of them reporting us late or not paying at all. We we have prove that we have paid every month and the month I was XXXX and took the car.
Mortgage,"My mortgage company changed servicers effective XX/XX/XXXX. I have been making payments thru my bank for the entire year of XXXX. My bank automatically sends payment on the date I indicate and for the amount of my monthly payment. I have not had any problems the entire year and HSBC has been crediting my payments as normal. My bank made my XXXX payment as normal but towards the end of XXXX ( approximately XX/XX/XXXX ) HSBC called me to ask where the payment was. I immediately checked with my bank and discovered that the payment was mailed over two weeks earlier ( as usual ). I obtained a tracking number from my bank and provided it to HSBC. Apparently, HSBC "" misplaced '' my payment for two weeks and they were able to quickly find it once I provided the tracking number. 

I thought this matter was resolved and received a letter in the mail from HSBC stating that the payment was applied to my loan on XX/XX/XXXX. I should have known that HSBC did not do the right thing at this point because the payment was "" applied '' on XX/XX/XXXX, instead of being applied on the date it was received ( not the date it was found after HSBC lost it ). To add insult to injury, not only did HSBC apply the funds late, and thereby charge me additional interest, they are attempting to charge me a late fee and a {$850.00} "" Property Inspection Fee ''. 

HSBC has been the worst mortgage servicer to work with ever and we've had so many problems with them over the years. Instead of getting into the past problems, we are asking you to please address the issue at hand. I believe they have treated me unfairly and perhaps violated other laws as well. For one thing, they lost my payment, that was made exactly the same as the ten prior payments ( mailed from my bank automatically every month ), then when they find my payment they did not back date the payment to the received date but instead date it when they "" found '' it. Then they not only added a {$28.00} late fee but some insane {$850.00} Property Inspection Fee. The payment problem was clearly caused by HSBC, who very likely had the payment for at least 7-10 days prior to applying the payment - in order for them to profit by a late fee and some other, incomprehensible {$850.00} fee."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I tried to freeze my credit today, XX/XX/XXXX with Experian and their online tool says they are unable to perform this action based on the information I have given, which is everything they ask for. I then tried to call them directly to perform this action over the phone and all they have available is an automated system that walks me through the same information collection and then tells me that I will need to mail in a request. The online tool also demands that I mail in a request. The information they request to be mailed in is everything a potential criminal would need to assume my identity. The address I must send the information to clearly states that it is going to the credit freeze department of Experian which means that any savvy criminal could intercept this letter and use the included information to assume my identity and wreak havoc on my life. Per the ruling of XX/XX/XXXX I have the right to freeze my credit for free. XXXX and XXXX  make this possible via online and phone. Experian is clearly trying to avoid people freezing their credit and working with consumers by making the credit freeze pathway too onerous/difficult. Their online and phone pathways are nothing more than a gesture to fulfill a government requirement and do not actually provide a safe path for protecting one 's credit and therefore Experian is in violation of the law. Experian should be forced to provide a safe online or phone pathway to freeze one 's credit just as XXXX and XXXX   provide."

Also when asking how they are getting the information. I receive a response that they are getting the information from XXXX XXXX.

XXXX days later I go back to check in with the garage where I was keeping my car, the owner of the shop told me never got a phone call, I call the bank and gave them the owner 's number. Next XXXX days they sent an estimator out and shipped the car off to another place for the car to be sold. The shop has waived lot fees for me from XX/XX/XXXX to about XX/XX/XXXX of 2019.

A couple days later I get a letter from the bank saying I owe them about XXXX $ ; XXXX $ for the transportation from the shop in XXXX XXXX, PA to XXXX, PA and XXXX $ or so for the day it was sitting there before the bank got the car.

A month goes by I call the bank they told me the car was estimated to be about XXXX $ and they would call me when it was sold and that the car was being sent to auction in Texas. They also tacked on another XXXX $ for what they claim is lot fees from the shop out here in XXXX XXXX. It has been over 4 months since they have had the car and has been shipped to multiple auctions already and still not sold. At this point it seems as if the car may have been sold and not applying the proceeds to the loan. The shop I had it at is called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I paid for a hotel stay with my CITI Credit card and was billed twice by XXXX XXXX. I submitted a charge back for the duplicate charge and figured it was resolved. A couple of days later, i received a communication from CITI that they have concluded their investigation, and that the determined that the charge was correct. When I looked at the attachment, i noticed that XXXX XXXX included a one page print out stating that I was a no show for the stay. My complaint was for a duplicate charge, i did agree with one of the charges. I proceeded to respond to the denial of claim, and write out a moment by moment account of what happened. Essentially, i called and asked for a room at XXXX XXXX, the said the could hold one if i gave them my credit card. I gave them my number, and when i showed up to the motel, they swiped it again. This is how i was charged twice. CITI responded with saying that they believed that the other charge was the incorrect one, and sent it XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX responded with my booking information, my name and my stay and CITI again reversed the charge and said that their investigation was complete ruling against me. 

I believe CITI Credit Card 's incompetence is harming the public. By blindly rubber stamping any reply from merchants i believe CITI is allowing merchants using their CITI 's services to commit fraud against the public. Based on XXXX XXXX 's response i believe XXXX XXXX is intentionally trying to double charge people, and utilizing CITI credit card laziness to facilitate their fraud of the public."
Debt collection,"I had an outstanding bill with XXXX. The bill was directly paid through XXXX. IC Systems reported a collection account on my credit attempting to collect the same debt through XXXX.

Rather than IC Systems removing the collection account they sent me a receipt stating that I paid a balance in full of {$1200.00} to them. Which is false. I never agreed to paying IC Systems, i never paid IC Systems. The payment was with XXXX and ONLY XXXX. This has negatively impacted my credit by lowering it more than 30 points, which has also risked my purchase of a new home!!"
Credit card or prepaid card,I have a American Express Bluebird prepaid card for a couple years now.

I've been on the phone with the company for 3 days and I told them that all my money that I had went on to that card it was {$1500.00} I told them that I I was stranded thousands of miles away from my house that I need to get home I rented a car it was on that card my rent my way to get home everything they told me I'd have to wait till the XXXX to get it done I don't understand it's my money I need it right now didn't make a purchase or order a new card I thought they had the protection against that but I guess not I'm down in out an have tried everything and am getting no where with American Express.

Vehicle loan or lease,"This is my second issue with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. XXXX is stating my balance is {$760.00} which includes a payment of {$290.00} which I made today and is leaving a balance of {$470.00} which includes the balance of my next payment of {$290.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX but it does not explain the balance of {$170.00} and there is no current statement explaining this charge. I am disputing the billing error in the amount of {$170.00} on my account. The amount is inaccurate because there is no statement indicating how this charge was calculated. My contract states that my car payment is {$290.00} every month due on the XXXX with a 10-day grace period. After the grace period I can be imposed a late charge to 5 % of the unpaid installment amount of {$23.00}, whichever is greater, after 10 days. I had previous late fees of {$23.00} or less that were credited back to my account along with a letter stating they have been removed from the account. I have not had a late payment since. 

I am requesting that the error be corrected & explained, that any finance and other charges related to the disputed amount be credited as well, and that I receive an accurate statement and an itemized statement of the charges. 

Enclosed are my copies of all my monthly payments ( including the most current payment ), the contract, the most current statement on account which is dated XX/XX/XXXX supporting my position. Please investigate this matter and correct the billing error as soon as possible. 

I dont know if this is in regard to the pending lawsuit against flagship and now they are doing erroneous billing to scare customers. I hope this is not the case because if it is then this company needs to be investigated IMMEDIATELY.

Mortgage,"As relief from the Country Wide loan fiasco. Bank of America purchased the 2 loans and placed me on an interest only loan. I applied for a modification in 2009. It was completed and I was placed on a step rate loan. ( fixed rate ) the HELOC was sold and the first modified. 
After 2 years amount increased per schedule, BUT was to cap at 4.5 %. Loan continues to increase. Nothing going to principal. B of A changed the loan to a jumbo Arm loan. I did not agree to another interest only loan. No other lender will touch it. Now Im upside down on the loan. I am stuck with 2 loans. I applied for a modification/ denied. Did not qualify. How is this helping me?. I was told by B of A to do a short sale. I have never been late or missed s payment since 2009! I dont want to sell.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am sure you are aware that it is against the law to threaten suit without any intention of doing so. Therefore, be advised that I am extremely serious about filing suit against your company. I have sent numerous letters requesting for you to investigate and remove all inaccurate information that is being reported on my personal credit profile, yet you continue to fail to do so. 
It is my understanding of the law that you MUST honor each and every request to investigate incorrect information and you seem to have ignored all of my previous requests.

Mortgage,"This complaint is in response to the complaint number XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent an offer and HUD to SPS for a short sale review. SPS indicated the offer was too low, and sent us the appraisal which is for XXXX XXXX. We received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming the offer submitted was too low and we had a right to appeal. This property has been on the market over 400 days. If a higher offer could have been obtained, it would have happened. However, the buyer not only has to contend with the inferior condition of the property, but also MULTIPLE secondary liens, including a department of justice lien, and an execution that must be negotiated along with an order of conditions on the property. 

In the XX/XX/XXXX letter, acknowledging an offer from XX/XX/XXXXwas too low, it stated if we disagreed with the decision we had 30 days to appeal in writing. On XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX we sent three separate individual value information packets for dispute, each with their own cover letter identifying appeal information. The appeals included the buyers inspection report, our listing history information, sold comps, and much more. The following week XXXX XXXX called in and confirmed receipt of this package and we were told the information was in review. At the time we submitted the XX/XX/XXXX dispute packet, a complaint to the CFPB was initiated, outlining the flaws with the appraisal that was done in XX/XX/XXXX. With the CFPB complaint we included all of the value packets, which included comps, meaning SPS didnt review the attachments. 

XXXX called in again and confirmed the value information was in review. On XX/XX/XXXX, We received a response back from SPS via the CFPB. In this letter, they indicated an offer they received in XX/XX/XXXX was not high enough. They did not acknowledge the current offer sent to them in XX/XX/XXXX at all. They also further said they could not analyze the information we sent because it did not include comparables, however the XX/XX/XXXX information sent in DID include comparables. 

XXXX XXXX called in once again and spoke to the Ombudsmans office. She was told that because we didnt submit the comps necessary for a value dispute by XX/XX/XXXX, that the comps we did submit were not considered. Im not sure HOW we could submit value dispute comps on an offer we submitted on XX/XX/XXXX. Typically a servicer reviews all the paperwork and offer and lets you know what is missing or what else is needed. That did not happen. The moment we found out the offer was too low we submitted the necessary information to dispute it. In the XX/XX/XXXX letter it stated if we wanted to appeal we had to do it in 30 days which we did on XX/XX/XXXX -XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX called in once we received the XX/XX/XXXX letter via the CFPB. On XX/XX/XXXX she spoke to the Ombudsmans office again, who at that time said they needed 3 SOLD comps within 1 mile of the subject property and dated within the last 6 months. On XX/XX/XXXX we sent them 3 comps. The were outside of the 1 mile area because even their own appraiser used comps almost 2 miles away from subject property, which is what we had to do, and we sent comps dated within 6 months of the original appraisal. We are now waiting for a decision. 

None of the above is proper servicing. We still have had no acknowledgement of the current buyers ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) offer. It is absolutely faulty servicing that an offer from XX/XX/XXXX still has not been acknowledged or responded too. They have also sat on value information for three weeks and have not responded, however managed to reset an auction date for XX/XX/XXXX while a file has been in review since XX/XX/XXXX."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from FHCANN & Associates contacted me in XXXX of XXXX and made me aware of a debt that I had for student loans. Prior to him contacting me I was not aware of an amount, or that I was in default. After XXXX spoke with me he and I made an agreement to set up an arrangement to get back in good standing with my student loans on an IBR program. The program that he advised me to get on was only {$5.00} a month for which he specifically stated would be a duration of 8 months. In the midst of our conversation I made XXXX aware that I would be filing taxes and specifically asked him, verbatim, if I had any kinds of garnishments against me with my student loans that I needed to be aware of. XXXX specifically told me no, that I did not have any garnishments. He also did not make me aware that I could "" possibly '' be offset either if I did file my taxes. On XX/XX/XXXX I made my second payment and revisited the prior conversation in order to be sure that I would not be offset once I did file my taxes. On XX/XX/XXXX I was offset for the US Department of Education. I called FHCANN & Associates and asked to speak with a supervisor, and was given XXXX XXXX. He stated that there was nothing that could be done. I called again at XXXX PM the same day, and spoke with XXXX another supervisor, who stated that the call had been reviewed by XXXX and XXXX had came to the conclusion that nothing was said off script and that XXXX `` did '' make me aware that I would be offset, and that XXXX never confirmed that I would NOT be garnished. As I told XXXX, this is incorrect, and I wanted the call reviewed again. I also requested transcripts to which XXXX told me that FHCANN is not required to give me, however he stated that the call would be reviewed by a manager and that he would follow up with me in 1-2 business days. I would like to make a complaint based on the misrepresentation that XXXX made. From my understanding, XXXX is NOT a tax consultant, and therefore should not be answering tax related questions with definitive answers. I, the consumer, was also not made aware of the "" possible '' offset which is a clear violation of FHCANN & Associates contract with the Dept. of Education."
Debt collection,XXXX XXXX XXXX is a result of identity theft. I recently discovered through my new monitoring service this account being reported I made efforts to remove this account from my file as the amount of {$500.00} does not belong to me. This account was fraudulently opened with this company in XX/XX/2018an has been reported to the FTC and authorities as Identity theft. I have submitted all of my information needed to resolve this matter in this complaint and through the FTC report attached and do not feel comfortable giving any further information in any way to any others at this time due to the further possibilities of identity theft.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Many numerous third party inquiries on my credit report that I did not ask for.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have notified all 3 bureaus countless times about blocking these fraudulent items off of my credit report. There are still a couple child support items, and a couple student loan collections that still remain on my credit reports in which should absolutely bare no relation towards me. These fraud accounts are not consensual, i never had a relationship with any of them, and there's been no good legal assessment in which i've been sent status updates or verifiable proof from these bureaus investigation. But i do know FCRA Laws and consumer rights, the reporting credit bureaus have been willingly violating the 605 ( b ) law. I've already mailed/faxed my cover letter, ftc i.d report with personal statement, police report, attached list of fraud items sheet and proof of identification sheet. All have been went documented, traced and sent over to all 3 bureaus, by 605 ( b ) law the reporting agencies each only had 4 business days after the date of my mailed documents receipt, to block the said fraud items with all the necessary documents i provided. I got dealt the wrong hand by these bureaus, they disobeyed the laws. NO LATER THAN 4 BUSINESS DAYS AFTER THE DATE OF RECEIPT BY SUCH AGENCY OF These accounts should have BEEN removed/blocked from my account. I have kept a paper trail this entire time, myself and my lawyer are in the process of filing a big lawsuit against these bureaus for Defamation, Negligent Enablement of Identity Fraud, and Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had a credit card with Banco Santander Puerto Rico for several years. I pay my balance off every month on time, so my credit history with the bank is excellent. Even though I was a resident of PR in XX/XX/XXXX, due to a work assignment I traveled to New Jersey in XX/XX/XXXX for several weeks. Since the due date on my credit card was XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed my payment on XX/XX/XXXX from New Jersey, just like I had done several times in the past. Under normal circumstances, 13 days was plenty of time for the check to arrive and be processed before the due date. However, hurricane Maria struck the island of PR on XX/XX/XXXX, which among other things, caused the US Postal Service to stop operations and delay all mail activity to and from the island. For this reason, my check # XXXX in the amount of {$2500.00} ( credit card balance due on XX/XX/XXXX ) did not arrive on time at the bank. This check was reflected on my account on XX/XX/XXXX, 14 days after the due date, and 27 days after I mailed it. To reiterate, my credit card payment arrived late at the institution not because of negligence or inability to pay, but because one of the worst natural disasters that has ever struck PR delayed the postal service. The bank charged me {$60.00} in late fees on XX/XX/XXXX. I  disputed the charges on a letter sent to the bank on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the bank  replied stating that the charges would not be cancelled because my payment arrived late, even though it was through no fault of my own."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This company is reporting multiple accounts on my credit reports that is inaccurate. I sent out a dispute to all credit bureaus regarding this company on XX/XX/2018 and still this company has verified information back to the bureaus that is incorrect and inaccurate. 

This company chooses to violate my rights by failing to complete proper investigating under section 611 and 609 of the FCRA. This company continues to report incorrect charge off information even after these accounts were closed. In some accounts showing that I was late even after the dates of last activity showed these accounts to be closed. 

Even after filing for a chapter XXXX bankruptcy, this company shares incorrect payment history while also not reporting statements like this account is currently a charge off account, 120+ days past due, 180 days delinquent, Account renewed, and/or no update received. This is obviously a violation as companies show only report accounts current/included in bankruptcy. It has been over 60 days from my initial dispute and I have sent 3 in total and this company still fails to correct this incorrect information and still chooses to delete this incorrect information after being challenged."

I have requested the Method Of Verification used in previous investigations but did not receive any response from either of the 3 credit reporting agencies. My identity has been compromised and accounts has been opened and closed in my name. I have no contracts with any of these corporations inwhich the 3 major  reporting agencies are reporting. I'm now demanding that this accounts be blocked from my credit data immediately. And if these accounts are not blocked / removed accordingly then I will file suit as of my rights as a consumer. Please block these fraudulently opened and unauthorized accounts, account # 1 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) account # 2 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$400.00} ) account # 3 ( XXXX XXXX {$4100.00} ) account # 4 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$0.00} ) account # 5 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$31000.00} ) account 6 ( XXXX XXXX XXXXt {$500.00} ) account 7 ( XXXX XXXX   {$870.00} ) account 8 ( XXXX XXXX XXXX {$1200.00} ), account 9 ( XXXX XXXX {$7300.00} ), account 10 ( XXXX XXXX {$8300.00} ), account 11 ( XXXX XXXX {$8000.00} )"
Debt collection,"XX/XX/2018 I visited XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I went in for a XXXX  XXXX/XXXX, at the time I hadn't ever had one before so I wasn't aware of why I felt like I was about to XXXX   XXXX. I explained to them my symptoms, which they somehow couldn't determine it was an obvious XXXX XXXX. Instead they started off by giving me a XXXX of XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) and then they put me through the ringer ; They ran unnecessary tests on me only to determine I was OK to go home. I was charged {$3000.00} for a drug screen after I told them I hadn't taken anything, yet they insisted I still XXXX in a cup without telling me I would later be charged XXXX for it. I was charged {$320.00} for a XXXX bag of XXXX   XXXX .09 %, HOW?!!? I dare ANYONE to look up how much a XXXX bag costs! Then I was charged {$1400.00} for an XXXX which resulted in nothing, I never said I was having any problems relating to the need of an XXXX, nor was I told that the use of their XXXX resulted in me being bumped up to a Level XXXX out of XXXX ER visit. But here 's the kicker I was charged {$6200.00} for that XXXX XXXX ER visit ... I WALKED IN AND OUT without assistance mind you. 
In total I was charged {$12000.00} for my visit and after insurance I was left to pay {$1800.00} ... Thats more than my mortage, HOI, and taxes combined!"
Student loan,"In XX/XX/2018 I contacted Navient to extend the income-based repayment option ( IBR ) on key federal XXXX loans, which at the time totalled roughly {$85000.00} with about 5 % interest. On the phone, the representative repeatedly dodged my request to do this, highlighting the options of the consolidation plan which had a $ XXXX  monthly payment opposed to {$150.00} for the IBR. The rep highlighted NONE of the effects of the plan other than the monthly payment, and due to distractions at the time and the reps persistence I agreed to the consolidation. When I realized they had added almost {$30000.00} in capitalization costs and fees and my balance was now nearly {$120000.00} at the same interest, I called ( XX/XX/2018 ) to see if they could work with me in some way to reverse/reduce the amount. They refused. I called again a few days later and requested the same, and also highlighted my concerns about pressured and potentially unscrupulous lending tactics, their response was to send me a copy of my promissory note! I called one more time ( Fall 2018 ) to ask again for help, reminding them I have XXXX kids and only make $ XXXX ( I've since become unemployed unfortunately ), and that the loan had placed devastatingly undue hardship upon my family. They never got back to me, and restated my balance of {$120000.00} and given interest rate. Please help!"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Please note that on XX/XX/XXXX a letter was mailed to Experian in reference to certain accounts that are reporting on my credit. I have asked under my FCRA rights to have these accounts verified due to the fact that I know nothing of these. Under FCRA 15 U.S.C 1681, the credit bureau are required to properly verify ALL information in reference to what they report on a consumer. 

Experian has responded saying verified however, there were no documents showing the verification. Even the company who is holding the account according to a complaint made here on CFPB shows that the company never received any documents showing a debt. Current Federal Law states that the consumer agencies bear grave responsibilities to ensure the accuracy of the accounts they report on and their responsibility must consist of something more than merely parroting information received from another source. also ordered by the court is that a re-investigation shifts the burden back to the consumer and the credit grantor can not fulfill the obligations imposed by 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ).

Under the FCRA section 611 ( 5 ) ( a ) these accounts should be Promptly deleted as it can not be verified with the proper documentation although it has been more than 30 days,"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX and my divorce started in XXXX XXXX  2015. She had sworn that she would bankrupt and ruin me prior to filing. Ever since filing she has made my life XXXX. Filing false XXXX charges ( all dismissed and expunged ), having my kids and I thrown out of house, changing my mailing address, contact info, spreading lies on social media about me ( ultimately getting her XXXX for harassment ) Most recently learning she had been having my mail forwarded to her new address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was informed that this was her address by the police officer when making the report after discovering address on my XXXX XXXX and XXXX bills. My car was repossessed, mortgage had gotten soo far behind that I had to modify it to keep it. I have debts and collections on my credit that I did not know even existed. She has been XXXX  for harassment, tried having me XXXX XXXXand or XXXX  by various people, and has attempted getting me fired for false charges made on me as noted above. The time and expense and credit issues I have incurred by this fraud has severely crippled me, making it difficult for my children and I. I am hoping to have my credit restored at least."
Mortgage,"Hurricane Irma in 2017 had major impact on my income and did damage to my house. I inquired about the forebearance option. The way it was presented to me was that since I could not afford the current payment they would suspend payments until the work to fix my house was completed. They gave me two options for once the work was completed ; I could either pay ( make current ) the payments that were not made during the suspension or they could remodify the loan. I specifically asked about the modification due to the fact that my income potential was drastically reduced ( due to Hurricane ). My question was to the point ... the only modification to the loan would be the  length ... if loan is suspended for say 3 months then the loan maturity date gets extended by the same. Their answer was yes. It took 9 months to get insurance company to correctly payout and get work completed, so there were no mortgage payments made for those 9 months. Once completed Loan Depot sent me a trial modification program to get the process started. I was told that the higher payments were to assist in getting the escrow balances back on track, I made all the payments ( on time ). Then came the loan modification itself, documents came along with foreclosure, short sale and deed-in-lieu documents. This scared me to death so I signed the new loan. My payments went from roughly $ XXXX/month to $ XXXX/month due to an additional {$18000.00} being added to the loan. They said it was for the unpaid months during forebearance. I called several times trying to get clarification but got the run-around each time. Not sure how it works ... loan payments were suspended ... yet they are charging me for them as if they made them for me. Again I go back to my question prior to accepting the forebearance program, trust me if I had any inclination that they would added that money to the loan I would have never done the program. They also talked on fees ( not sure for what ) and reported me to the credit bureaus as late over 120 days ... which they promised me they would not do. 

I feel as if I was scammed, the program is to assist people in times of trouble and because of it I have an even bigger problem now. If I was going to have difficulty paying {$1700.00} a month ... how can I afford {$2100.00}"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have disputed the student loan account with Transunion for several attempts, to no avail.

It USED to say it was added XX/XX/XXXX in the "" things that have changed section '', but they deleted that all together when i filed a dispute.

A month later I get a report that XXXX XXXX  has been reporting me every month since the program began as deliquent due to a past due payment when I enrolled.

The staff member inquired about jobs, which my husband and I had both lost our jobs and began a job change. She then asked if we defaulted on the trial payment plan which we assumed was yes. We did not continue with our payments due to their mistake and the confusion, and wanted to protect ourselves. Come to find out yesterday, however, she assumed we meant we would have defaulted anyways which is not what I meant. She would not provide me with documentation of saying this either though I have all email correspondence and there is no record on email. At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I communicated with this staff to begin a new application. I never heard back from her for four weeks, and had to reach out first to have the process continue this week. By this point, I had received a deed of trust. She sends the information to the underwriter who informs me to ask for a postponement as I had not received a full paycheck yet, and would not until the end of XX/XX/XXXXand for the mistake. I requested this and it was denied, with my auction set for Monday. None of this would have occurred had my documentation not been lost.

As a precaution I also filed disputes. On XXXX, the dispute results came back "" Current, was 30 days late ''. This registers as derogatory.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","CREDIT BUREAU LATE PAYMENT DISPUTE with Chase XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX SSN : XXXX Dear Sir or Madam : I hope youre doing well today. My name is XXXX XXXX, and Ive been a satisfied customer of Chase for nineteen years. Ive always made my payments on time, but unfortunately, I recently made a mistake on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I understand how important it is to make timely payments. However, I missed my payment because my husbands XXXX XXXX that was in remission came back. I had turned off my auto pay with the intent to pay my balance in full and missed both my XXXX and XXXX payments because of the stress of the XXXX my husband underwent. As soon as I realized my mistake, I paid the balance in full of {$3900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. 

As a person with a credit score of XXXX all of my life, I have never missed a payment to Chase, or any other creditor. As you can see from my account history, I have a long record of on-time payments before and since the late payment. This mistake cost me over 60 points on my credit score and I am sick about this. 

As a courtesy, I respectfully requested that Chase make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment on XX/XX/XXXX. Although Chase sympathized with my cause enough to credit me the {$39.00} late fee, they have still reported my credit account as delinquent and this is affecting my credit score. At one point, someone at Chase told me that they would see what they could do. When they forwarded my case to their Credit Bureau team, the team would not help me. I have been a pay-in-full customer for 19 years, and because of this relationship and record, I have asked for a goodwill gesture to remove the delinquent note, and they have refused. 

My track record is proof that I take my financial obligations seriously and I implore that you help Chase XXXX see that I am a customer worth offering this gesture of goodwill this one time only.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Good Morning! 

How are you doing? I was shocked today when I reviewed my credit report again and found late payments for my student loan accounts. I disputed this account and nothing was sent to me to legally verify the accuracy and legitimacy of this reporting. It continues to report incomplete, inaccurate, and unverifiable information, and therefore, it's impossible that it was investigated and verified as being accurate Hows it possible that youve reported me 90 days late with no late payments prior to that like the 30 and 60 days, and questionable balance still reporting? Also, wasn't XXXX student loan servicer sued for not applying payments to consumers accounts correctly. This is reporting in violation of my rights and honestly, i don't want to waste your time nor mine going back and forth, and I would like this removed from my credit as I was never late the way you're reporting it."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This is regarding an account listed on my credit report byXXXXL  XXXX XXXX XXXXunder  account # XXXX**** I sent a dispute letter regarding the information that Transunion and XXXX reported re : this account on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and both times Transunion and XXXX  responded by stating that they full verified the information on the account as 100 % accurately reported. However this is completely untrue. 

This account is being reported as a balance of {$8300.00} on my credit report however I have documentation ( attached ) from XXXX XXXX showing a balance of {$7600.00} since XXXX of XXXX. As a matter of fact, you can see via ledger that a balance of {$8300.00} was NEVER owed by me to this company. 

What this means is there is absolutely NO WAY that Transunion and XXXX  could have legally verified the information they claim they did and my rights as a consumer were flagrantly violated. 

Also, enclosed documentation also shows the account was opened AFTER the date XXXX has reported on my credit report. Another violation. They also continue to report payment history despite this account being in a charge off status. More violations. 

Also I respectfully demanded proof from XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX  that the repossession of the subject vehicle was legal in accordance with the following UCC : 9-506. - EFFECT OF ERRORS OR OMISSIONS.

9-611. - NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL 9-612. - TIMELINESS OF NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL.

9-613. - CONTENTS AND FORM OF NOTIFICATION BEFORE DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL No such proof was provided within 15 days from their receipt of my certified mail notice, which means the alleged claim of a deficiency is considered null and void, and any continued collection activities, or continued reporting of this invalid claim on my credit reports is a violation of the FDCPA and FCRA."
Debt collection,"Credit report shows fradulent account in collection with Trident Asset Management.  Credit report states account was opened under XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and the date "" deliquency first reported '' is less than 1 month later, XX/XX/XXXX. However, "" date of first deliquency '' is almost two years prior, XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have only ever had an account with XXXX for a very short time before the XXXX buyout, starting in XXXX XXXX. The debt owed is NOT my personal debt and I have received zero notices from Trident regarding this deliquent account. Attempts to contact the company directly resulted in the company violently terminating the phone call without prompt. Clearly they are VERY LIKELY engaging in illegal activity and fraud, given the amount of reports listed on this website and others ( XXXX, BBB, etc. ). 

I have filed disputes with XXXX and the other bureaus are pending. If necessary, I can followup with XXXX to confirm I have never had an account in or around the dates Trident Asset Management has listed."
Debt collection,"I don't know if these practices are legal, per say, but I wanted to make someone aware. I made a purchase from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CT. They outsource their financing "" promotion '' through American First Finance and that is the company I am complaining about. The offer was to purchase a mattress with no payments for 60 days and no interest for the first 6 months. It wasnt until after signing up did we find out there was a {$50.00} early payoff fee ( on top of the {$50.00} for applying for this service ). When going online to make payments, there was no easy option to do so. They do not let you remove or edit your account information ; only add new accounts. They also had prescheduled payments through the end of the year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) without my permission, to be automatically debited from my account. This would put me way past the 6 month "" no interest '' time frame, and I had not option to change or remove. I made a {$75.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX and the website gave the option of counting towards your next scheduled payment or not. I chose to count towards my next scheduled payment and the website populated a next auto-debit date of XX/XX/XXXX ( {$24.00} ). They then debited my checking account on XX/XX/XXXX without my permission. Attempts to rectify with them were useless. I decided to just pay off the remaining {$160.00} balance and any fees. They accepted my payoff, deactivated my online account immediately ( not sure why ) and then emailed a reciept of payoff. Two days later they debited a different account that was used in determining my credit qualifications, over {$500.00}. I called and they confirmed they debited in error and do not know where this amount came from since my balance was only {$160.00}. They said they would return the funds in 7-10 business days. In the meantime, my account is incurring late fees. This is the worst finance company I have ever dealt with and I am concerned that they still have my account information."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",On XX/XX/2019 Franklin Collection services reported a derogatory remark on my credit report for a collection of XXXX dollars. The original creditor was XXXX XXXX. I later learned it was my ex wife who open the account under my name with out my consent. I called Franklin collections to resolve this and get this remark off my credit report because I’m currently try to purchase a house. The told me “ pay the full price and we will remove it or pay partial and won’t take it off the credit report. I was met with rudeness and unprofessionalism. I have told them I had no knowledge of this account to which their response was rude and unsympathetic. I need this removed off my credit report and I’m even to pay a partial of the collection considering the account was open with out my consent.
Debt collection,"I already reached out to the credit bureaus and to XXXX XXXX for the account number XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX for the account number XXXX, notify them of their error posting for this account. I DO NOT OWN THIS DEBT, and I have been monitoring my credit report for any changes since my several dispute letters, but I am yet to see the correction that I asked for and desperately need. Continued reporting of this inaccurate and UNVALIDATED debt. I thought they had dutifully complied to the law to cease any collection efforts unless proper validation has been provided. Then I found out that the issue still persists, I just had to escalate to CFPB."

Reviewing the final letter sent to me by Bank of America, that has close to no information about the 'process ' of their "" investigation '', it's very clear that the Bank has failed to do due diligence to their own investigation.

Credit card or prepaid card,"My complaint is against Chase Bank and their credit card service. They did not provide me with a valid reason for rejection of my dispute on a transaction. 

I made a purchase with a company and they charged me the wrong amount. I contacted the company and they were unwilling to credit the difference. 

I filed a dispute with Chase and was told that if I did not have a receipt showing the amount that I was supposed to be charged, then I was liable. 

This payment was placed by phone and I never signed or agreed to any documentation to support what I was charged. The merchant responded to my dispute by sending a contract that is signed by the seller but the signature line for the buyer is blank. For some reason Chase took this contract WITHOUT a signature as proof of it being a valid charge. 

I escalated the dispute up the Chase Executive office and was again denied. I was contacted by a XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. She repeated the same as the dispute department that I needed a receipt as proof of what I should have been charged. I asked her that if anyone wanted to be deceitful, they are not going to give any paperwork. 

I also asked her that if this person would have charged me {$20000.00} then agreed, that I would be liable? She stated that yes, I would be. 

I asked her if she could send me Visa rules or even Chase rules stating such. She refused and then said she would but never did. I called her two different times requesting this information and she never returned by call. 

If this is the rule for credit cards and the general public knew, that would be an end to all credit card use. Who would make a purchase by phone or internet knowing they are liable to whatever amount the merchant charges? 

Thank you for any assistance on this matter. I didnt realize until now that I had an option to file a complaint about my bank.

Two issues that they have incorrect is they show I have no installment loan and according to their models, this hurts my credit score. If fact, I do have an auto loan that they showed all of last year but for some reason fail to show it now.

They also show a debit balance on my credit card that has impacted my score by 18 basis points. When in fact, I have a credit balance. It appears they looked at the credit balance as a debit balance.

My FICO scores should be much better than they are reporting. I track them and the information provided several times a month.

I often receive a notice that their sites are down and when calling their contact numbers only get into a calling tree that does not allow me to reach a representative.

I discovered in XX/XX/XXXX that my loans had been placed in in-school deferment. I wished to continue paying as normal, so I contacted FedLoan and submitted the necessary paperwork to have the deferment removed, backdating to XX/XX/XXXX. Since that time, however, I've dealt with a series of errors, beginning with my account showing as "" paid ahead '' around XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke with a loan counselor in XX/XX/XXXX to resolve the issue, and continued to make my monthly payments as usual. Since I discovered the XX/XX/XXXX error, I've spoken with at least four different loan counselors and have received varying explanations and solutions, including the following : - Loan payments were misapplied, and would need to be manually reapplied, dating back to XX/XX/XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX ). She informed me that this process would likely take 7-10 business days. 
- In pursuit of an update on the reapplication of my payments, I spoke to a loan counselor from the PSLF program on XX/XX/XXXX. According to him, one part of the system was showing as past due, while the other was showing as paid ahead. Should be fixed as of this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ), but will call back tomorrow if not. 
- The loan counselor I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX, ID # XXXX - did call back on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX, and left a voice message. However, when I called FedLoan, I spoke to a different counselor who said that only the XX/XX/XXXX payment needed to be reapplied, offering two solutions : 1 ) go ahead and pay the {$76.00} that was supposedly "" past due '' - an amount that has fluctuated from day to day - or wait a month to process a reapplication of the XX/XX/XXXX loan payment. I selected the latter. 

As of Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, it appears that only the "" paid ahead '' error appears to have been resolved. However, my online account now shows that I apparently owe {$100.00}, and that my account has jumped from 10 days past due as of yesterday to 42 days past due."
Credit card or prepaid card,"Hello! 
On XX/XX/2018 I was shopping at the T.J.Maxx ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX ) and I bought a couple of items in the amount of {$280.00}. The next day I did not want one of my items and wanted to return it ( the total cost of an item was {$190.00} ) but the store declined my item because the item was missing a security tag but they were the ones who took it of when I left the store, other than that the item had all the tags and everything and I didn't even wear it. I called Synchrony Bank about 5 times and filed 2 disputes but what they told me is that different stores have different policies and that they can not do anything about it. I still have the item and I want to return it ( it has all the original tags )."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I attempted to have Kohl 's pay my account in full every month by providing banking information. Either I entered part of the information incorrectly or there was a problem with the transmission. By the time I learned that the account was not on autopay evidently the account had become past due. I pay every credit card I possess in full every month through direct withdrawals. My accounts with Master/Visa/American Express typically have balances totaling $ XXXX each month and they are always paid in full ; the balance in the Kohl 's account that is reported delinquent was a little more than {$200.00}, an amount that is trivial. When I learned what happened, I paid Kohl 's in full but was so annoyed with the way this was handled, I closed the account! Because I made a concerted effort to correct my bank information and pay Kohl 's in full in a timely manner, reporting the account delinquent to the credit bureaus is completely misleading -- it is the only late account on my entire credit report, that has a XXXX-year history. I have called Kohl 's on at least two occasions and asked them to remedy this but they have not. My credit score dropped approximately 100 points because of this issue. Kohl 's needs to do the responsible thing and delete their report to the credit agencies that I paid late. They are acting in a fashion that is reckless and irresponsible."

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am disputing the charge of {$42.00} interest made to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, leaving my account with a balance of {$42.00} due on XX/XX/XXXX. I paid my entire balance of {$2800.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, leaving a balance of {$0.00}. Imagine my surprise on XX/XX/XXXX, when I checked my account to find that even after I had already paid my entire balance as it was shown on my bill due XX/XX/XXXX to find that even though I had paid my full balance as shown on the bill, that I now owe more money? 
I called customer service as Capital One does not give customers the capability to dispute finance charges online as it does with disputed charges or purchases. I was then told that because I did not pay off my full balance for two ( 2 ) consecutive months that I was charged for interest in arrears for the month of XX/XX/XXXX and that is why I still owed {$42.00}. 
This is an unfair charge and should be removed from my account without further delay. It is unfair because there is no amount on the face of the bill which states : Note, if you have not paid your total account off last month, you will owe {$42.00} in interest in addition for the prior month to the charges shown. Also, if this is the case, {$42.00} should have been added into the balance to be paid in full and I would have paid it as part of the full balance."
Mortgage,"To whom it may concern, this will be the 3rd complaint submitted on this file. The client recently filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy and since the bankruptcy has been filed, we received information that is concerning to not only the client but the bankruptcy court as well. Complaints were filed with the CFPB on XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 regarding a discrepancy of the number of modifications the client has already received. The lender was claiming three modifications were received by the client but could not produce any documentation confirming these modifications even existed. A complaint was filed to ensure the CFPB would step in demanding copies of the three modifications the lender stated she received however that was never done. The reason the amount of modifications received was in dispute is because per the client she only received 1 for the life of this loan and in the pooling and service agreement she is entitled to more than one. Per CFPB guidelines the lender needs to exhaust any and all loss mitigation options that would allow the client to keep her home if there is a valid hardship in which there was and still is. Instead of the lender helping her they wanted to increase her monthly mortgage payments to over 51 % of her net income which is clearly not affordable and would cause her to lose her home. That is not a modification by any means. Also, by stating she has had multiple modifications it created a bias with the investors as they were under the impression, she had three already. Per the answers from the complaint filed on XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 the lender admitted to providing incorrect information and stated the client has only had two modifications. That letter will be attached for your review. The concern at this time is after speaking with the bankruptcy attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX about this issue she requested copies of any and all modifications on the file and the lender confirmed with their attorneys that there has only been one modification given to the client XXXX XXXX since the loan was taken out which again contradicts what the lender is stating and it seems as though the lender has given nothing but false statements to not only the client but the CFPB as well. This is not only outrageous but extremely unfair and against the guidelines of the investor who should be required to assist us with this matter as the lender is solely their responsibility. The investor and the lender should be held fully liable and accountable for the false statements and false information given which not only could cost this client her home but also effected the bankruptcy proceeding as well."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I have been a loyal customer and account holder with Wells Fargo for about 5 years now. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a {$10000.00} secured credit card with them so they took a {$10000.00} collateral from my checking account. Since the day I opened this credit card account, I had paid on time and never missed a payment to this day. I never overcharged the card or went above the limit. In fact, over the past year I never really used the card for more than {$500.00} a month which I would pay in full at the end of each month. 

Finally, after 3 years, Wells Fargo decided to release the collateral and change the credit card account to an unsecured credit card. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from them stating that they would be depositing the collateral amount ( {$10000.00} ) into my checking account by XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. I did not receive my collateral by XX/XX/XXXX and they made me run after my money for three weeks for different excuses. Once, the check was lost in mail, another time one of the managers had forgotten to sign the check, and another time they had realized that not been able to deposit the collateral into my checking amount for some mysterious reason. I finally received the check 10 days late and after more than a dozen phone calls and follow ups. 

Furthermore, Mid-XXXX, after my credit card had changed to an unsecured card, I received a letter from the Executive Office of Wells Fargo, stating that "" to manage their risk '' they've decided to close my account. I then, called every single department I could speak to, including the Executive Office, but they did not provide me any proper reason to why they closed an account with perfect payment history, no late payments, no high utilization and etc. I Spoke with probably more than 20 representatives and spent more than 24 hours on the phone with them to get an answer, but I wasn't successful. 

I spend 4 years building history and a perfect relationship with Wells Fargo and had {$10000.00} of my hard earned money sitting with them as collateral to make sure that I built history on my credit report and all of a sudden they closed my account for no good reason. This is clearly a discriminatory act by Wells Fargo since I am from the XXXX. I have been a victim of discrimination by this financial institution and want others like myself to be aware of what they did to me. I dont want this to happen to any other lawful XXXX XXXX like myself who work hard in this country and pay taxes like any citizen."
Debt collection,I sent a certified letter in XX/XX/2019 asking for verification and validation of the debt and they received it on XX/XX/2019 and it's been more than 30 days and now it's XX/XX/2019 and they the have yet to respond or delete from my credit report in which the Law requires them to do
Checking or savings account,"I opened a business account with XXXX XXXX, I went to deposit some checks on XX/XX/XXXX. The teller said my account was closed, I asked why, she said I had closed it. I went home to look at my statement and the account was never closed by me and it had money in the account. I then called customer service and told them of their error, XXXX said the account was closed due to several return mail fees, she said someone would contact me within 5 days, later that day XXXX called me and said the account was closed due to return mail fees, he also stated it was my responsibility to notify the bank of an address change, he was shocked when I told him my address never changed, he said he would investigate and call back on XX/XX/XXXX after he talked to the branch. XX/XX/XXXX it was getting late so I called XXXX back asking for the explanation, he said the branch had no explanation, I asked him to reopen the account and put the money back into the account, he refused and said he could do nothing about it and it was up to the branch manager. I called the branch manager XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX SC XXXX. XXXX stated they do NOT have any proof of returned mail but my account was charged for the returned mail fee, then charged every month after until all money in the account was depleted, they then closed the account. XXXX also stated they do this if an account is inactive hoping this will trigger the customer to question the fee, but the customer only has two weeks to dispute the fee. I believe this bank never sent a letter to begin with, the post office would stamp the letter saying return to sender with a date back to the bank and they would have proof it was sent. XXXX then refused to reopen the account and put the money back into the account. XXXX then offered me to reopen the account after I came in to sign a new contract for the account. I then understood what they were doing. This bank merged with another company and my original contact was with the former bank which had no monthly fees to service business accounts. XXXX XXXX not only fraudulently took money from my account for returned mail fees they never sent but also purposely closed the account so I would be forced to sign a new contract which included monthly fees to service business accounts. I also requested the explanation in writing from XXXX  XXXX and all parties refused. I have contacted an attorney."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been disputing, reporting and complaining on the unfair, fraudulent acts of this company for almost two months.

I was only sent a letter with a hospital name a diagnosis code ( WHICH IF THIS WAS MINE IS ILLEGAL FOR THEM TO HAVE ANYBODY MEDICAL INFORMATION WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION AND IS A HIPPA VIOLATION ) and two amounts. This is not VALID VALIDATION. Proof of VALIDATION include leases, promissory notes, credit card statement, Medical Consent, contracts with an original signature from the Original Creditor NOT the collection agency.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I attempted to access the online dispute functions on the Equifax website on Monday XX/XX/2018. I was able to access it, but it timed out before I finished my dispute, so I logged back in to try again. This time all three security questions contained lenders/creditors I didn't recognize as they pertained to the questions and I answered none of the above for all of them. Apparently I answered one or more of them wrong because I was locked out of the account. I tried calling equifax today and spent an hour on the phone with them with no success in regaining online access to disputes and my credit report. I was informed several times during this phone call that my name was incorrect and and that I could only get upper level website support if I was a paying customer. Both the customer service representative ans supervisor claimed my name issue was at the fault of the creditors. On my other credit reports I have several versions of my name reported because of the way different creditors report items, but Equifax only had one name and it was incorrect. In 13 years of credit history they have only one name listed for me. It is absolutely impossible and can't be the fault of the creditors when those same creditors report to other agencies properly. I was told I could get a report mailed to me but could not regain access to the online dispute and would have to fax them a letter with my driver 's license and social security card in order to make any disputes and correct my name. I have no idea how these procedures are similar or vary to other credit agencies, but I'm deeply concerned about the name variance and abnormal creditors listed on my security questions."

I wrote a letter to Barclays to  challenge the closing, and received a letter back stating that they could not reopen my account and told me to apply for another card. When I applied I was denied, by another letter stating I had not paid or filed bankruptcy which was completely untrue. Again, there is no number to call. The company has the worst customer service I have ever encountered. Unfortunately, they have a lock on the XXXX card, and XXXX status is very important to me, otherwise I would never deal with this company again."

After this complaint, Transunion fixed part of the problem - they removed the derogatory account from my report that was not mine, but they did not fix the underlying issue : They have the wrong SSN, Birth date, and several incorrect addresses in my account.

Although I called this out, they did not correct these errors. With the wrong identifying information they will continue to add incorrect accounts to my credit report. This is unacceptable.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I am Citi Card member since XXXX. I am a fan HOWEVER When accessing my Citi Bank credit card account online on XX/XX/XXXX I chose the option to pay my current balance which is generated by the computer system. I paid the current balance leaving the card with a XXXX  balance. 
Ive since found charges from the closeing statement on my card and could not figure out why the numbers did not work. 
I then called Citibank for clarification. The reason they gave was due a gray area where they said that even though I paid my current balance online its really a statement balance So thats why the balance didnt include the charges after the last statement which ended on XX/XX/XXXX ... soo not a current balance?? or as the website current balance disclaimer says This is the current balance on the account today including any remaining balances from the previous statements close date. Does not include any pending or interest fees. Also warns you not paying your balances in full. Ok so then how do I know what to pay so I dont get charged. 

So the discrepancy I was complaining about were the charges ocurred on the XXXX and throughXXXX that were not included on the online current balance XXXX payment. 
Even though it says it is the current balance.and even though the statement end as the XXXX? The representative said I should be able to figure it out ... from what the limited information Citi provides listing all charges by date but not by when it actually occured ... REALLY???? impossible to figure out. 

Additionally, the system does not give me the option to pay my last statement as opposed to my current balance it does not say anything regarding differences in balances. 

I complained to Citibank clarified to them that I am paying online and not by paper. I complained about the difference experience between paper and online statements. 
The supervisor that I spoke to named XXXX number XXXX said he would forward the complaint and apologized for the misleading information on the online account. 
I called today XX/XX/2020 at XXXX and spoke to citibank for 47 minutes. 

It is so difficult to figure out because the difference between the current balance and statement balance are not clearly stated. I tired but couldnt find any information anywhere to quantify the balances shown. Impossible to figure out. 

This is not the only credit card that this is happening to my fianc also is having the same exact issues with XXXX  XXXX XXXX. 

The banks then are charging fees if we dont pay off our full balance due but how can we pay off our balance when it is not clearly stated and we have no idea what our final balances are. 

So if I pay on the XXXX I do not expect the purchases I made on the XXXX to appear after that date. 
Lets get crazy and consider if it takes the bank 4 days post a payment ( in this day and age ) is that not something that should the consumer should be made aware of? and should the consumer be penalized for that as well? How are we supposed to figure our balances out? 
Should be plain and simple not hidden or need a accounting degree to figure out. 
Since the inception of computers and programs that allow us to be responsible and pay our bills ontime to avoid fees however that doesnt make banks money and I believe they made this intentionally deceptive and confusing. 
Overly complicated policys and proceedures makig it so difficult to figure what we owe then penalize our mistakes."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX we became aware that someone had ordered a copy of my credit card to be sent to NY, a state I don't live in nor have ever lived in. I called CapitalOne right away and told them to cancel the card. They agreed to cancel that card and issue a new card with a new number. I also complained about the {$16.00} "" Fast Card Fee '' and was assured that it would be refunded to the account. 

I never received a new card. The next thing I know I get a letter saying that they investigated for fraud and determined that there was no fraud and that I am responsible for the charges. I also received a bill for the same card number, which was never cancelled, with thousands of dollars charged to the card for transactions I do not recognize. Moreover, I received notice that they closed the account for violating the terms of the agreement, which damaged my credit score. 

I called CapitalOne again right away ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and asked why this was allowed to happen as I told them to cancel the card more than a month ago as soon as I realized someone had ordered a card fraudulently. No explanation. They agreed to open a case at that time and start investigating. 

It has now been over two weeks and I am still getting the run around. My account is still closed, my credit is still affected. None of this should have been allowed to happen. If CapitalOne had closed my card on XX/XX/XXXX as they said they would do, all of this could have been avoided. 

As if this weren't enough, CapitalOne claims that they did not send the first letter saying that they investigated and have no record of the case number on that letter. We called a phone number in that letter and gave the person on the phone sensitive information. I have twice sent this letter to CapitalOne 's abuse department for confirmation that it was indeed a fraudulent letter but they have not responded to that either"

Credit card or prepaid card,I had opened a citi bank credit card on XX/XX/2019. In order to open this card you needed to connect your bank account to put your own money on the credit card. It is not borrowed money from the credit card. You can only spend what you deposit onto the card. I deposited {$900.00} onto the card. Which came out of my bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX I had spent ONLY {$900.00} on a purchase. Which was my money I deposited onto the account. After i had spent my money that was in the card to make the balance {$0.00}. I called and closed the account because i only needed the card for 1 purchase. So on XX/XX/2019 the account was closed. On XX/XX/2019 I got something saying my minimum payment of {$25.00} was due. I didn't understand this because I had closed the account. Didn't borrow any money from them. Only used exactly to the XXXX what I had deposited onto the card. And now they are calling me telling me I owe them over {$200.00} when I had closed the account before the billing cycle. And only spent my money that I deposited.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","As of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX updated my credit report by continuing to report a 90 day late for XX/XX/XXXX. The issue here is that all of my loans were placed in forbearance during the time that the 90 day was reported. 

Facts : Employee ID # XXXX completed a forbearance on my account that started XXXX and ended on XXXX. 

Employee ID # XXXX completed another forbearance on my account that started on XXXX. 

A forbearance is a LEGAL AGREEMENT that allows the account holder to temporarily stop making federal student loan payments. 

Later on XXXX a 12 month IDR plan was placed on my account. 

In accordance with The Fair Credit Reporting Act ( The law intended to protect consumers from misinformation being used against them ) XXXX XXXX XXXX is not in adherence due to reporting a 90 day late on my credit file and continuing to keep reporting it even though they are fully aware that my account was under the XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX forbearance completed by employee ID # XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX has not provided any information that states that they will report negatively to the credit bureaus while under an approved forbearance. I have faxed in documents, called in, and emailed regarding this issue."
Student loan,"We have made numerous attempts with Navient to set up affordable payment arrangements in XXXX that were all denied because the amount was not sufficient for them to accept and they were aware that the payments were unaffordable, was told that various items that we had by one of their agents were "" luxury '' items ( such as a vehicle to get to work ). Account was sent to a collection agency, struggled to make {$250.00} a month payments which were supposed to help our credit, they were still reporting the loans as delinquent and not reporting the agreed upon amounts of the loans. Those payments were stopped after one year because they were, again, not affordable and were affecting our ability to pay our monthly rent payment. We were once again connected by yet another credit collection agency in XXXX and we advised them of the previous attempts with Navient to pay something toward the loans and nothing was ever received back from that agency nor Navient. 

Navient is reporting the loans as Closed and Charged off but still reporting them as being delinquent. If the loans are truly charged off, I would like them to stop being reported as delinquent and the amounts reduced to zero. We would be willing to make monthly payments, however, it would be an amount that we would feel comfortable in paying for a specific period of time and that Navient would need to report them as being current at the agreed upon amount."
Mortgage,"I have been a US Bank customer for a year now. I recently was looking at my Annual Escrow Account Disclosure Statement as of XX/XX/XXXX and noticed that besides my shortage of {$480.00} US Bank is adding a reserve requirement to my account for the amount of {$130.00} which is causing my shortage to be {$610.00} rather than {$480.00}. This amount has been prorated over 12 months for the amount of {$51.00} which should only be $ XXXX {$40.00} over 12 months. I work in a large home mortgage company in which to my knowledge with escrow, per the law, the state of Nevada does not require a reserve. However, US Bank is adding a reserve to my account. This company is exhibiting unethical and illegal behaviors. I called US Bank today XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to a representative named XXXX in which stated that they are unable to remove the reserve per their policy. I asked to speak to a supervisor and the agent stated there was not one available and transferred me to a senior agent by the name of XXXX. This agent did not help me in any way and kept stating that per their policy they can not remove the reserve even after i mentioned that the law does not require a reserve and per RESPA they are allowed to have one but if the state prohibits a reserve they should be able to remove it. Conversation was not going anywhere towards helping me and clearly they are not abiding by the state law. Please see the screenshots and the highlighted information as reference."
Student loan,"Two loans taken out on XX/XX/XXXX unsub XXXX, sub {$5500.00} for fall term XXXX. I withdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX winter quarter XXXX. Funds were not returned to the lender ( Bank of America ). Unsub and sub loan funds were used in creating two Unauthorized unsub ( {$3300.00} ) and sub ( XXXX ) loans on XX/XX/XXXX changing grade level from ( 3 ) to ( 1 ) and listing on all four federal student loan disbursement notice incorrect total loan amounts. All four notices listed {$10000.00} ( 2 ) and {$10000.00} ( 2 ). All four notices do not have loan ID # numbers on my NSLDS. Unauthorized second MPN for direct loans was not signed by me. The XXXX University employees in the financial aid forged my signature by typing my name on an unauthorized MPN for two loans {$1000.00} and {$8500.00}. Grade level, credits earned, and ungraduated status, changed to Graduate student were changed and other loans taken out. Loans were hidden from and listed on general ledger as fall, spring, winter and summer charges. Part-Time student tuition fees added to standard allowances plus loan fees totaling XXXX. Overcharging me tuition/fees {$88000.00}. Police report filed forged signature and fraud. DL loans listed as financial aid funds on student general ledger. Bank of America wont produce loan documents because I never signed a any loan applications"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/2017 a SLS representative named XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be wrong ) left me a voicemail in which she stated that I am required to have an XXXX insurance policy and to send evidence of an XXXX insurance policy. She also stated that it was Required by the State of Florida that I have an XXXX insurance policy for my condominium. This voicemail is provided in the attachment to this complaint. In addition, I believe should also have a recording of this same call given record retention requirements for loan services. 
I have requested the regulatory citation referred to by SLS. SLS has not provided me in writing any legal citation that I was required in the state of Florida to maintain an XXXX insurance policy. I am requesting that in response to this formal complaint, SLS provide a response to the following two questions : 1. Do you agree or deny that your SLS representative left me a voicemail on XX/XX/17 stating to me that an XXXX insurance policy was required by State of Florida law? 
2. Can you provide a citation from Florida law that was EFFECTIVE AT THE TIME OF OUR COMMUNICATIONS that specifically and clearly states that XXXX insurance was REQUIRED? 
Any response provided by SLS to the aforementioned questions will be insufficient. This request is simple and clear and I hope SLS can respond timely and appropriately"
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 we mailed our MasterCard bill ( issuer ; XXXX XXXX XXXX ) payment of {$500.00} ( more than 4x the  required amount ) to the card issuer. The 'due date ' on the bill was XX/XX/XXXX. Due to severe winter weather, the transit time for our payment was longer than usual and the payment was not processed by the card issuer until XX/XX/XXXX. The card issuer confirms that the payment was received and processed, our bank confirms that the check has cleared and funds have been transmitted to the card issuer. However, the card issuer states that they have not yet recorded the payment in their system hence the account is marked 'delinquent ' and the card is suspended/'restricted ' for one month due to being in a 'delinquent status '. During a phone conversation yesterday evening ( XX/XX/XXXX, o/a XXXX  ), a supervisor ( XXXX/ # XXXX  ) at the card issuer further stated that their processing can take an additional ten days, resulting in further 'delinquent status ' time plus interest and penalties. I informed the supervisor that the Uniform Commercial Code and established law states that when normal payment is accepted through the US mails, and the payment is deposited to the mails prior to the due date, that payment is considered delivered to the addressee and hence should not be considered past-due and delinquent. Her response was "" We're not a bank and the UCC doesn't apply to us '' and that the card would remain in suspended/'restricted ' status for the next month. 

I resent paying 25 % interest for the privilege of being treated like some low form of deadbeat. I further resent being offered "" that's our policy ( and there's nothing that you can do about it ) '' as a defense against ignoring long-established law. 

I am absolutely certain that the delay in the mails caused by the recent severe winter weather affected more than just our payment. I am also absolutely certain that the card issuer has and continues to ignore the provisions of the UCC and established law in their processing and handling of delayed payments as well as the issuance of late fees, interest, and penalties."
Debt collection,"On Saturday XX/XX/2020 I received another letter from Allied Collections Service Inc. after I told them not to contact me. I also advised them that I was going to file bankruptcy plus that Im judgment proof ( extortion proof ) because Im XXXX and have been for over 5 years so Im unemployed  and will never be employed  again. They have harassed me over and over ( the tie up the local court system harassing the poor ) I even changed my phone number because of their harassment. I havent filed bankruptcy yet but Im in the process of doing the paperwork and Im definitely filing ASAP so because of all the above they have no reason to continue the harassment. If you look at my last complaint I attached everything Im pointing out now in regards to them being advised not to contact me, bankruptcy and being XXXX."
Debt collection,"XX/XX/2019 I told Global Payments Check Services, INC in XXXX, IL I would pay NSF return checks within the day time period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/2019. and to Stop calling me 8 times a day. Repeat back to back calls and leaving "" Threaten Hang-Up Calls '' and harassment. Their number is ( XXXX ) XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",There are many mistakes appear in my report without my understanding.
Debt collection,"My son, has been on SS benefits since he was 8 years old, he has XXXX  XXXX  and XXXX  XXXX  so I am writing this out for him. He got a credit card back in XX/XX/2008 and I was paying on it. He had a run in of problems and couldn't pay any longer. Through the years we got phone calls, letters to pay XXXX XXXX. Years ago an attorney firm of Hayt, Hayt and Landau contacted us, made everything look legal, but still my son said can not pay. Just a week ago, I received this deposition notice that they want him to appear at the Bar Association where we live with all kinds of paperwork, proof of income, property, etc. All he has is one vehicle and we share one junked vehicle. Now today I get a FINAL NOTICE from the USPS that there is a large package that has to be picked up. We are home everyday, no post officer knocked on the door for a  signature, he just put the slip in the mail box. I wrote them on their website ( Contact Us ) and told them, he is on SS, this is a very old debt, not on his credit report ( which I just checked yesterday ) and to stop harassing us. We do not have anything else, as myself, and my other son are also on Social Security. I am my son 's rep payee and he says he will not pay an old debt. They can not garnish federal benefits if this is a time barred debt. If this makes it to the Magistrate, then so be it, we will make payments. But they have been harassing us for years, I had to get a phone system that blocks callers. I read on the net that this company has gone to many lengths to collect a debt. If this is something we definately need to take care of, I need to know. I will talk to my son but it will have to be a very low payment every month and they can bring it down 30 %. I am afraid to talk with them on the phone and my son won't."
Student loan,"I completed my XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. In summer XXXX I was offered an opportunity for loan reduction and forgiveness ( if eligible ) by XXXX via mail. I called and spoke to a rep about the offer. I completed an application for loan consolidation and forgiveness. 
Upon processing, I was told I was approved. My monthly payment would be {$12.00} for the next 240 months, at which time the remaining balance would be forgiven. The only condition was I had to re-certify my income each year. This remained true until XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status of my account and latest re-certification. I was told it was being reviewed, but me new payment would be between {$68.00} and {$130.00}. I was told the increase was because my family size decreased from XXXX to XXXX. This is incorrect Upon re-certifying my income, my monthly payment increased to over {$250.00}. I called customer service and was told there was an error on my application. I needed to correct and resubmit my application. I asked why the payment would increase so much even with the error. I was told because my family size decreased from XXXX to XXXX and my income increased. That information is incorrect. My family size has always been XXXX and my income decreased from XXXX to XXXX. 
Upon correction, re-submission and review I was notified via email my new payment was about {$220.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called customer service to see if my payment could be adjusted and ask why so high of an increase. I was offered 2 payment plans that were still much higher than {$12.00}. I asked to speak with someone who could explain why these amounts were so much higher. 
I was transferred to another department. This rep told me again, the change in payment was because my income increased. Upon further review, he also said the original processing agent made an error. I was never eligible for the {$12.00} monthly payment plan. I asked to speak to someone higher up since this was not my error. 
I was transferred to an escalation agent Upon review, this agent told me that I am indeed eligible for the original {$12.00} payment plan I was on, but had to review my information further with the appropriate person and call me back. 
The next day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) i received an email stating my IDR request had been denied. I never submitted another request. 
I called again on XX/XX/XXXX to ask what this was in response to. It was explained to me that A review of my account was submitted It was determined that I was previously on a PAYE plan. 
Because of my current income and family size, I was no longer eligible for the PAYE plan. 
The rep who went to process, put me on the income contingent plan because I did not request the PAYE plan ( i was never offered this option or told that would be the appropriate next step ). 
The email I received stating my IDR request was denied was in response to a submission for partial financial hardship ( i never submitted such a request ) Following this phone call, i was told to allow 24 business hours to receive a call back from the escalation agent who said she needed to review my account further. 

It has been over a month since I first contacted them about this issue. I've sent over 5 written correspondence with no response. The information I have is from 5 phone calls."
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX called me regarding a debt that was not mine it was an identity theft. it was over XXXX years ago or more. they threatened to put a lien on my current cc. they called my XXXX mom, sister, work and harassing me none stop.. they are rude. they know my minor child name, school she attends."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened a XXXX XXXX credit card of XX/XX/XXXX. The bank that administers the account is Comenity Capital Bank out of XXXX XXXX TX. 

My first complaint about Comenity Capital Bank is they do not have any auto pay function on their website. It is clear they are looking to charge a late as a tactic to make money. My major concern is when, I opened the card the cashier at XXXX XXXX said I should apply for a store card because it has zero interest for 12 months. He explained that after 12 months the card would start charging interest which has been typical in my lending experience. Never did the store associate explain they would charge all the interest for the promotional 12 month period. I have been making minimum payments on the card for the last 12 months and the statement reminds you that you need to pay off the balance or you will be charged ACCRUED interest charges. I'm not a finance major and was not aware that accrued means ALL interest. As I mentioned early, I was told the interest would start after the 12 month promotion so I didn't pay attention to the term accrued interest. When applying for the card all I signed was a 2 '' x3 '' LCD screen which is the "" AGREEMENT. '' I took the associates word for how the terms of the credit card work since it is impossible to read the "" terms of agreement '' on the tiny screen. It was my error for not viewing my credit card statement in detail each month, but today XX/XX/XXXX I noticed a charge for {$280.00} for the accrued interest. I was told that the interest would simply start at the end of the 12 month period. I called Comenity Bank and was transferred four times and they said sorry nothing they can do and I signed an "" agreement '' ( which was on a 2 '' x3 '' screen ). I explained my concerns and told them they are intentionally misleading consumers starting at the XXXX XXXX store. They said I should have looked at page three of the statement where it told me what the accrued interest was in same small black print as the rest of the various numbers. I asked why they couldn't put this on page one in bold red numbers saying this is what you will have to pay if you don't pay your account by the specified time. This is clearly a tactic they use to generate revenue. It isn't at all transparent and it is predatory in nature."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Yes, it involves the three bureaus. It is with fica also. There is a judgement on file against me. I was a holder among others of a credit card of a company that went out of business. The business owed the credit card money. They could not collect from the company because the company went broke. So the credit card company then sued all employees that held a company credit card. Not knowing i could be liable and the others also ignored the credit card company. they file suit against employees of which I was one an got a judgement against me and others for the company debt. XXXX judgement is on my report. If it is going to be there it should show the reason for the judgement which I am still contesting. 

Next, i am shopping for a mortgage. I am looking for a rate suitable for me. It may take one month. It may take six months. In the meantime hard pulls are being made and each time my credit score goes down and down. if you look at the payment portion of my credit it is 100 % on time, never late and paid the amount and sometime more each month. tis has dropped my score to low 600 's. It is uncalled for and I so disagree with fair XXXX  as to how they record inquires and makes credit scores drop."
Checking or savings account,"XXXX withdrew {$26000.00} from my checking account between XX/XX/2019 and XX/XX/2019 for XXXX cancelled reservations but I only authorized {$19000.00} for withdrawal. After many phone calls with XXXX during the past 30 plus days, and after being transferred several times to their payment processor, XXXX, today, XXXX from XXXX stated that XXXX has no supporting documentation for the {$26000.00} of withdrawals from my checking account. Also, he stated that only XXXX, the payment processor for XXXX, has this documentation but my contract is with XXXX, not XXXX. Then XXXX refused to put his statement to me in writing. Then he hung up, un-announced, from my phone call. A representative from Wells Fargo Banks XXXX department was a participant during this whole phone call today. 
XXXX withdrawals detail for {$26000.00} follows. 
{$6800.00} on XX/XX/2019. 
{$4800.00} on XX/XX/2019. * {$3900.00} on XX/XX/2019. 
{$3100.00} on XX/XX/2019. * {$3400.00} on XX/XX/2019. 
{$2900.00} on XX/XX/2019. 
{$1500.00} on XX/XX/2019. 

*XXXX  refunded these two deposits on XX/XX/2019, apparently to settle an unrelated dispute for overcharging RENT PAYMENT FEES ( description on my bank statement ) as a result of my contracted payment of {$500.00} per year per listing to cover all XXXX rent payment fees. I calculate {$7900.00} of overpaid rent payment fees."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Recently, I've grown an interest in monitoring my credit. I and my family are ready to purchase a home. As I've gone through credit report, I've noticed a few unauthorized inquiries and an account that does not belong to me. Please remove this from my credit report immediately as this is poor judgement with on my credit worthiness."
Student loan,"I have been trying to get a {$0.00} balance off my account. The minimum payment is {$1.00} but you can't make a payment of more than what you owe. I am stuck. Discover Student Loans claims it has been working to resolve this issue for months. They have continued to mislead me by patronizing statements and claiming I would receive documents explaining the situation and I have not. This student loan still shows on my credit report because the loan is not closed. There is seemingly no reason in Discover 's own words, that I owe them anything yet they continue to have this account open with a balance. Discover Financial had {$93.00} billion in assets in 2016. You expect me to believe that you don't have the IT infrastructure to solve this in less than 3 months? This is predatory. You are trying to export me and I will not stand for it."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Date : XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern, XXXX, Experian and XXXX  are reporting inaccurate information on my credit file. They have failed to investigate and verify that these items are reporting correctly. Their action has hurt my ability to obtain new credit and this is very troublesome to me. I have been disputing with them since XX/XX/XXXX last year and they still have not corrected the errors and this is a direct violation of my rights under the FCRA! I have documented each letter that I sent to them and their responses that I can use in my defense. I am asking that the said accounts below be removed from my file immediately! 
Accounts Account Name : XXXX XXXX Reporting on XXXX  and Experian 1. Open date of XX/XX/XXXX is incorrect. 
2. Past Due Amount of {$720.00} is incorrect Account Name : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Reporting on XXXX, Experian, and XXXX 1. Two different account names : XXXX  and XXXX  2.

Account Status : 2 states Closed and 1 state open 2. 2 Different Open dates : XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. Balance of {$1200.00} incorrect"
Bank account or service,"I have a bank account with Wells Fargo that I opened in Washington XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I have been more or less employed since then. I was working in XX/XX/XXXX and have not worked for the past three months. I ran into problems when my Washington State Unemployment ran out and I had to apply from XXXX. They made me wait three weeks for my {$270.00}. I ran into issues with Wells Fargo and overdraft fees when I discovered they would process payments ( ie from Pay Pal ) usually recurring payments when I did not have money in my account. I asked them several times to not pay out money I do n't have and do n't charge me for overdraft fees. They ignored me. Then I would argue with them. Then Wells Fargo decided they were not going to refund any more overdraft charges. Currently I am overdrawn with Wells Fargo for {$500.00} of which almost the entire amount is overdraft fees of {$35.00}. My initial arguement with them started when I asked them to make sure my water bill got paid, and what do you know they did n't pay the amount out and then I got hit with {$35.00} of overdraft fees plus {$30.00} from the water and sewer department. All without a single human hand touching the transaction. I have called Wells Fargo several times until I just lost it and told them XXXX themselves. Now I am on a permanent blacklist. I am so sick and tired of the blame the victims mentality which translates into bullying. {$500.00} from XXXX XXXX is nothing, {$500.00} on {$270.00} unemployment is astronomical. I have been offered a job but I have no idea when that will start so I am pretty much living on payday loans which needs to be another complaint. Its ridiculous to have to pay {$35.00} overdraft fee when this is all processed by computers. If there is anything XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has shown, it cost fractions of a cent to process anything by computer. I admit I should not have lost it with Wells Fargo but it was supremely satisfying to tell them off. And in a civilized country I should be able to yell at Wells Fargo."
Credit reporting,"As this is the only soapbox I can use to complain about the credit monitoring services I wish to complain over and over again until this system is fixed or got rid of. I came to this country as an XXXX 30 yrs ago. I worked, paid taxes all this time and paid my debts. I decided to go back to school at the age of XXXX. I applied for a XXXX plus loan. I was denied. I was never given the specific reason for the denial. but it could have been one of the four following. A collection account, a tax lien. I was denied a job in XXXX because of XXXX. I actually paid off the IRS tax lien. I was denied a job by XXXX in XXXX because of the tax lien. I paid off the tax lien in XXXX, 2016. You would think I had bells and whistles and chocolate but no. I have been going back and forth with XXXX I wonder at using XXXX anyhow to determine whether or not I should be able to get an education. In 30 years I have never been given a perfect credit score. Ever. I had a {$100000.00} mortgage until XXXX decided to put me into eleven years of litigation and they graciously let me have a {$300000.00} mortgage which is ridiculous at this stage of my life. I am not the only person in the US who suffered through the Great Recession that has decimated the XXXX and over population. The tattle-tale credit reporting system needs to be overhauled. I strongly suspect that only while middle-age males get perfect credit. I think women, immigrants, of any ethnicity, XXXX and XXXX probably never get good credit ever."
Debt collection,XXXX  accounts  XXXX  and  XXXX  have appeared on my   XXXX   credit report.   I contacted Doctors Business Bureau to complain. I was advised by CFPB to ask for the name of the doctors? who claim they were not paid. I have no evidence of this debt. I have had no bills regarding this debt and Doctor 's  Business Bureau have  refused to give me information. I talked to a  XXXX   XXXX  today who hung up on me before trying to transfer me to the voicemail of her supervisor  XXXX   XXXX .     This debt should not be reported to  XXXX  if I do n't know anything about it.
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/17 ATM withdrawal. Did not receive funds. ATM made noise and did not dispurse funds. First withdrawal was the max {$400.00} that transaction was completed. The second withdrawal for {$160.00} was incomplete. No funds dispursed. A third test of a {$20.00} withdrawal to infer that the money was not stuck. That transaction was completed. I Did not receive the {$160.00} transaction only the transaction before and after. I have spoken with my card company. I can not get a supervisor no matter what I do. They just put you on hold. Nothing happens. They issued a temporary credit for {$160.00} now they have withdrawn the credit stating there was no atm error. Obviously there was an atm error I do n't have the {$160.00}. The company I use is a pay card * skylight * The company told me that they would send me an email within 48 hours of documentation of the outcome of my claim "" atm withdrawal "" however ; I have not received said information."
Mortgage,I received notice my loan was being transferred from XXXX to Loan Care. I then received a bill from XXXX  mortgage. I suspected fraud because the letter from XXXX did not mention XXXX. I called XXXX. They told me I was actually one month ahead on my payments. That my XX/XX/XXXX payment would actually be my XX/XX/XXXX payment. I have sent in a payment each month this year. I was actually told I am a month ahead of schedule. I then called LoanCare and gave them my email address to contact me if there were any problems. In XX/XX/XXXX I called just to check the status and I am told I owe since XX/XX/XXXX and my mortgage is in collections. I have sent receipts of all of my payments. I need this straightened out ASAP.  By my accounting I should be one month ahead of payments. Loan Care is showing me due from XX/XX/XXXX.
Debt collection,"There is a collection company called Credit Control LLC that has called me and threatened me and they have also sent me a bogus offer to settle a debt which they can not verify or validate. They say that they represent some company called XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have asked both companies to send me the original agreement from XXXX XXXX showing that i had an account with them and they REFUSE To do it. They are falsely accusing me of having a debt of XXXX that I do not owe. I do not have a contract with either one of these companies but they are trying to harass me and extort money from me and I have demanded that they cease and desist with any collection activity. I am sick and tired of having to go through this with these companies and I am demanding that a full investigation be done into their illegal collection practices when I have requested and demanded that they stop contacting me, stop sending me stuff in the mail and they have threatened to put this on my credit reports without sufficient proof that this is a valid debt and that this debt is mine. I have asked for the original contract and source document and they CAN NOT and or WILL NOT PROVIDE IT. Provide a credit card application with my signature and this can all be settled, you can not because one does not exsist. XXXX  XXXX has taken an old unverified debt, wrote it off as a loss then sold it to these two bogus companies for a false collection attempt and I will not stand for this anymore. They just contacted me again today and I have asked them not to."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019 a criminal ( or group of criminals ) used my American Express Bluebird card number ( issued by American Express XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). These were 65 consecutive retail transactions done in the state of Missouri. I live and work in the state of Minnesota. 12 of the scams were done at different XXXX XXXX Stores around the XXXX XXXX, Missouri area. I've not been in that area for over 10 years nor have I ever shopped at a XXXX XXXX Store in my 55 years of life. I was told by the company when I called on XX/XX/XXXX that I had to wait until the 65 transactions settled. They all settled the next day XX/XX/2019. I then called back and issued a fraud report. I was told by the rude customer support person that I needed to complete their fraud form. I spent over an hour completing that form, detailing each of the 65 consecutive transactions. I told them I was shocked that their "" fraud prevention system '' failed to flag this behavior and stop it before it gouged me for over {$8900.00}.

Mortgage,"I send my mortgage payment the first or fourth of the month. My mortgage is handled by Flagstar Bank. I asked them why there is a delay in crediting my payment most times the XXXX of the month or later. I also wanted to pay by phone, but was told I had to pay a fee of XXXX dollars. I pay mostly by phone to my home bills and only one bill requires a fee of XXXX  dollar and XXXX cents. I have called them repeatly and spoke to different agents to ask if the fee can be waived and always got a negative answer. They suggest aoto debit or payment on computer site, for which there is no fee. I would like to pay my first of the month bills by phone so as not to forget the dates due. I am a vet. and XXXX XXXX years old so my memory is not how I would like it to be. If this a legal requirement all banks have, then I am satisfied, if not, perhaps this Bureau can garner some help for me. If not, I thank you for all things possible."

I was later able to send back the items and got a refund for the shipping cost. on XX/XX/XXXX I got a credit for {$53.00} which is not my full refund. I contact XXXX and I am getting no where. Based on my experience. I call XXXX and their agents tell you anything just to get you off the phone. They don't listen very well, you have to keep repeating yourself and when it's to where you are on the same page, they transfer you and you have explain and try to bring them to what you are calling about. They again tell you anything to get you off phone. A XXXX is never available. Today XX/XX/XXXX I told agent XXXX from the XXXX that I want to speak to XXXX she state none was available when I insist.

As explained in my email reply, I currently do not have a phone, I further explained the reason for my refund request of fees and complaints filed prior with CFPB. She replied back asking me to go to a local branch to call her, I replied stating I do not have a branch near me and requested an account of fees in order to work out a resolution via email, I closed stating no refund at all is unreasonable and no reason to discuss it over the phone, she did not reply as of yet ... It appears she was not able to offer any kind of settlement, I hope I am wrong ... I emailed her back today on XXXX, to follow up.. I received a reply via CFPB today, XXXX, to prior complaint filed about issue of fees charged to prior accounts and accounting of them. The reply states Wells Fargo stands by prior decision not to refund which is unfortunate as there is currently an investigation by one ore more law firms into charging of overdraft fees by several banks, including Wells Fargo. If Wells Fargo will not work this out directly with me, I can assure them I will get some sort of refund through any settlement which arises from investigation. I am still willing to work with XXXX, I do not have a phone to call her currently, I have been without a phone for several weeks..If she can provide me a offer of settlement via email, I will gladly take it into consideration and reply ASAP."

When I asked for the source to whom performed this verification / validation, I was told they do not disclose that information and that they are not obligated to do so.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have been seeking to have Equifax remove fraudulent inquires from by credit report for the last several months. I was repeatedly told by Equifax that I could not question these inquires and that I had to contact the issuers that made the inquire and have them report to Equifax that these inquires were made due to fraudulent activity. Despite the fact that I am not sure I did not have the right to question these inquires, the problem was that I had contacted the issuers multiple times, and each of them indicated that they had so reported to Equifax more than once. After months of effort, an Equifax representative finally told me that I could have these inquires investigated by Equifax if I faxed a written request with certain information and supporting document. I did this on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019, Equifax sent me a letter stating that they were unable to locate my credit file. This is a blatantly implausible statement. Equifax had sent me my credit report on XX/XX/2019, and it was identified by a specified Confirmation Number, which I was required to include in my letter. Thus, it is simply impossible to believe that Equifax could not find my credit file using its own Confirmation Number. This seems to me to be a continuation of Equifax ' unwillingness to take reasonable and appropriate action to investigate and correct, as appropriate, false items on one 's credit report and to throw up obstacles to doing so. Equifax claims that it need me to mail it evidence of my social security number along with official evidence of my address. It is incredible that Equifax would request anyone, let alone someone who already had their identity stole, to send such personal information throught the mail, especially when Equifax was already provided, at its insistence, with their own Confirmation Number for my credit file. No one should have to risk, needlessly, sending such information through the mail."

I explained that I have been paying the {$180.00} every two weeks and I'm paying off this loan two months after receiving it, there should be no way that in order to pay it off I would have to pay {$120.00} over the amount I initially borrowed after paying the {$180.00} since XX/XX/XXXX every two weeks. I explained this is almost illegal and that I would be reporting them. They sent me an email stating that because it is a tribal loan that they have a right and I signed off it."

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I decided to request my free credit reports and noticed that there were charges from a medical collections agency, Grant and Weber, on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX, on my credit history report that are detrimental to my score. There are several items to consider on this. 
1 ) Negligence in informing me of this. I never received notification that this was on my credit history 2 ) The one phone call I got from this company - I provided the necessary information for them to contact my insurance, XXXX XXXX. I have always been fully insured and have never incurred any medical expenses that were not covered by my insurance. 
3 ) I have disputed these charges already and yet continue to see them in my credit history Here is the information on these two disputed charges gleaned from the credit report : GRANT & WEBER # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , CA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Placed for collection : XX/XX/XXXX Responsibility : Individual Account Balance : {$170.00} Date Updated : XX/XX/XXXX Original Amount : {$140.00} Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX Past Due : > $ XXXX Pay Status : >In Collection< Remarks : ACCT INFO DISPUTED BY CONSUMR ; >PLACED FOR COLLECTION< GRANT & WEBER XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX MAIL RETURN XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX Placed for collection : XX/XX/XXXX Responsibility : Individual Account Account Type : Open Account Loan Type : COLLECTION AGENCY/ATTORNEY Balance : {$330.00} Date Updated : XX/XX/XXXX Original Amount : {$290.00} Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX I strongly request that these charges be immediately removed from my credit history. This is impacting my ability to have a FICO score that reflects who I am : a law abiding citizen who responsibly takes care of her debt and financial responsibilities. It is negatively impacting my ability to receive the best interests rates on loans and therefore this gross negligent behavior from Grant and Weber is having a negative impact on my economic status and potential as a consumer. Grant and Weber should have contacted me - and show proof of contact - prior to placing these and ignoring my request to remove them. Grant and Weber has the insurance company, XXXX XXXX information, on file to handle these internal disputes between medical groups - it is highly inappropriate to have used me - and injured my credit history - in their collection process."

Mortgage,"Re : Wells Fargo On XX/XX/2019 I paid {$80000.00} off the back of my mortgage. The receipt I received said it would post that day which it did not. Today I noticed that they took out next month 's mortgage payment, which I had already paid with an additional {$12.00} off the back and did not apply {$580.00} to the back as they were supposed to. They have admitted their error and said it would not be fixed until Monday XX/XX/2019. I asked that they get this done today with the same click in which they took money from my account without authorization. They are not allowed to take money from this account as I pay it myself.

Our Balance as of XX/XX/XXXX was {$1500.00} out of {$6900.00}. We paid the majority of this within the first year in a lump sum. They ran a 2 year promotion of interest free and when XX/XX/XXXX hit there was {$2400.00} on my account for an interest charge. Before this and after this, I received XXXX cutesy notification that the promo was expiring or that this would be what would be hitting my account. I recently received ( 1 week ) calls from their call team trying to collect money that now the balance is {$3900.00} within 1 month. I called and tried to talk to multiple supervisors and they told me there's nothing they can do. I offered to pay the remaining balance right away and for an interest charge of the remaining balance. Instead they said there's nothing they can do and I had to pay a 3x of what my outstanding actually is. They had XXXX cooperation and very little customer help. Again, we are frequent shoppers and have perfect standing with credit and the majority was paid. This promo charge is ridiculous considering what the balance left and Citibank is a complete scam with their lack of communication or heads up to their customers of anything changing. They only called to collect after that large interest charge was put on the bottom line. I will no longer be affiliated with either companies. This is a major disappointment across the board."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/Tek-Collect Inc Date : XX/XX/XXXX Re : Acct # XXXX  To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX  Vs. XXXX  ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX  debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX   sent XXXX  a letter declaring that XXXX  disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX  should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX  proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX  on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX  ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of Appellee at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX  loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX  had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX   on this issue. I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ 1000s. You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. I intend to follow through with the suit if I do not hear back from you within 15 days. I look forward to hearing from you, Thank you."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Below is my dispute letter sent to the creditor along with the important dates : ************************************************** Hello, I will explain the timeline of events below and why I feel that I should not have a delinquency on my credit report. 
XX/XX/XXXX - My monthly payment is normally {$340.00}. I was behind a month so I paid {$690.00}. My bank account was charged {$1300.00}. 
XX/XX/XXXX - I notice the over payment and call to have {$690.00} refunded to my account. They tell me it takes 30 days to process I should see funds by XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - I notice my account is still showing delinquent even though they are in the process of refunding my money. I ask and they say it never got processed and that it would be another 30 days to receive funds. At this point I tell customer service to not write another check. I told the representative to cancel the refund and credit my account. The {$690.00} would have made me current up to XXXX so this made the most sense to me. They tell me it takes 7-10 days to cancel but the account will be current and there will be no late fees. 
XX/XX/XXXX - My grandmother gets a harassing email. I check on the account and they say I am 70 days delinquent. I asked what happened to the refund check cancellation and account credit, they tell me that didn't happen and that they wrote a check for the refund on XX/XX/XXXX. When I asked why they wrote a refund in XXXX even though I cancelled the refund in XXXX I received a no answer XX/XX/XXXX - I make a payment of {$340.00}. I believe this payment should be for XXXX, however since my account was never credited this payment went towards XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX I make another payment of {$340.00}. I believe this should be for XXXX, it went towards XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I finally receive the refund check. 
XX/XX/XXXX my credit repair representatives notify me of a delinquency showing up on my credit report. I call AES and the representatives tell me to fill out attached dispute form. Also, I pay the remaining {$690.00} the same day In summary, I would like to have the delinquency removed from my credit report since your representative assured me that my refund check would be cancelled and my account would be brought current on XX/XX/XXXX. For some reason that did not happen and I do not feel my credit report should reflect miscommunication from your organization. I have been working very diligently on repairing my credit report and this delinquency is cause severe damage to my credit. Thank you for reading my dispute and I look forward to hearing from you with a resolution.

************************************************* B
elow is an updated time line of the dispute : XX/XX/XXXX I was working with a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were to fax my dispute letter in XXXX. I never hear a resolution. The email directly to AES regarding the status occurs on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I receive a dispute response from AES and they deny my dispute and take no action. I now file a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have filed several disputes with Experian regarding inaccurate information and one of the items is a XXXX account that only Experian is reporting still. I have sent proof that XXXX removed it multiple times yet EXPERIAN claims it is valid when they do respond or 2 of my disputes still have not been responded to and it has been well over 30 days for each of them. 
I called Experian today and the rep told me to file another complaint on here and attach the document again and they will remove it. I should not have to fight 5 years to get this erroneous item removed! 5 yrs it has been on my credit and I have had XXXX for 17 yrs! never have switched phone companies. 
You are affecting my financing and because of that and all the proof I have of my complaints & your responses my attorney said it is grounds for a law suit. 
The next correspondence will be from my attorney."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am filing this complaint because credit bureaus did not help me remove the accounts after so many attempts of writing dispute letters.. I asked for evidence, any documentation that could prove the accounts are my responsibility but they didn't..CFPB step up and remove XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Original Creditor : UTAH XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Original Creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX   XXXX ( Original Creditor : UTAH XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( ORIGINAL CREDITOR : XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX ), XXXX XXXX XXXX,"
Debt collection,"I received several phone calls from a debt collector under the name of JPL Group, claiming that my debt of XXXX in principal with the company XXXX XXXX had been transferred to their company for collection. The voicemails threatened lawsuit action and left various different contact numbers. After several missed calls, I answered a call from JPL on XX/XX/XXXX. A woman named XXXX XXXX informed me of the above-mentioned debt. She said that if I did not pay the debt in full over the phone, they would serve me with court papers and court date, claiming I would need to defend my case in court. I told her that I would need to verify the debt as legitimate before I would give her company any money and asked her for contact information. She provided me with this information : JPL Group jplgroupsolutions.com XXXX XXXX - Civil Processing Division Collecting debts on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX ext. XXXX Business Hours XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX  Loan received : XX/XX/XXXX Principal Balance : {$500.00} I requested copies of my bank statements for the entire 2012 year, and I found no deposit made from ANY loan company. 

Next, I called XXXX XXXX and provided them with my personal information. The customer service ran my information through the XXXX XXXX database and no record of any loan. He then passed my information along to his manager who ran my information through the company 's extensive database. Again, there is no record of loan issued in my name at any date or time. 

XXXX XXXX filed a complaint in regard to this fraudulent matter and asked that I also file a complaint as an individual to aid in the prevention of further fraudulent debt collection attempts by the company JPL Group."
Debt collection,On XXXX XXXX I called the Creditor which is Victoria Secret also listed as Commenity Bank in regards to the account that was closed last year but was still being reported as opened and late on my credit report XXXX  under XXXX different amounts one for XXXX dollars and the other for XXXX dollars. Victoria secret agent informed me that even though the account had been closed by me do to fraud that it was still being charged because of the insurance that was on the account when it was first opened. I told her I dont have insurance on my card and never needed it since it was a small limit. She told me to call Account XXXX who does the insurance for all XXXX XXXX Bank accounts. I called and spoke with a supervisor after waiting over XXXX minutes to be transferred. The supervisor got on the phone and told me to contact the Credit Bureaus directly. I contacted the XXXX Credit Bureaus and was told that they only report what is reported to them by the Creditor. So I called back Victoria Secret and told them what the Credit Bureau said and they told me to dispute it with Credit Bureaus and the Credit Bureau would reach out to them and they would respond. So I tell her why do I need to do all of that for something that was reported by them that I was not aware of nor did I authorize it. She said that is how we do it.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have been denied several checking accounts due to information that I believe to be related to identity theft on this report. When I requested a copy of the report on XX/XX/2019 I was told that i did not pass the authentication with the operator even though I supplied them with an address that I have resided at for over 4 years. I was then told to go online to print out a request then mail it in and that from the time they receive it to give an additional 15 days to receive the report. Due to the sensitivity of this issue potentially being an identity theft issue I feel as though this matter should have been escalated to prevent any further harm being done to me.
Student loan,"I have a loan with XXXX XXXX with a co-signer, my co-signer filed bankruptcy and during that process I was told I could not make payments and couldn't get in info on the loan, even my online access was shut off. Now my loan payment has skyrocketed and now I can't take the co-signer off the loan because they said that broke up me not having 12 straight payments due. Now they tell me I should of demanded to put money on the loan anyway even though I have letters from them saying no access can be made to the loan.I asked multiple times can I pay and was told no.They won't even work with me on the new high payment I cant afford.The last letter I got was XXXX19 telling me I can't have any loans or communication about that loan so how can I make payments when I was told it didn't exist till after that process was done. I also got told if I wanted a lower payment then don't pay the loan for months and they will give me payment options."
Debt collection,"I got a debt collection notice claiming it is in regards to an account with XXXX. I've never had a credit account with XXXX. In fact, when I used them as a payment processor for selling used items on XXXX, I caught them stealing my sales before I got a chance to transfer them to my bank account and also stealing directly from my bank account for foreign transactions I never received or transferred as investigated and determined by my bank. Because there was no way to unlink my bank account from XXXX and they refused to return the funds or abide by XXXX or even their own posted Seller Protection Policy, I had to close down both my XXXX store and bank account of 20 years to avoid future theft. This phony debt collection seems to be yet another XXXX scam. XXXX has never issued me a credit card or loan of any kind nor would I ever accept one from a company that stole my hard earned sales of personal property."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a situation where XXXX XXXX is reporting on my credit for a transaction that was cancelled. This transaction is now reporting on my credit and hurting me both financially and personally. I have been writing XXXX XXXX for years now and they continue to report this account while in dispute and their intent is to hurt and damage my credit reputation. 
At this point I am in correspondence with an FCRA to look at how the bureaus handled this investigation and he will investigate XXXX XXXX XXXX process into this issue. This is an account that was charged interest and fees for a cancelled transaction. This is a disputed inaccurate account that is on my credit and needs to be removed. This is an violation of several laws including section 1681 ( i ) ( a ). There needs to be a reasonable investigation into this dispute matter AND its the bureaus responsibility to go beyond the original source. 
Please see attached information."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have disputed the inaccuracy of my payment history ( XX/XX/XXXX ) for all eleven of my federal student loans to the credit reporting agencies ; Equifax and XXXX ( XXXX has followed FCRA laws and updated my account information ). my dispute investigations keep resulting in verified account information. This ca n't be accurate and I am questioning the validity of the verified account information because I have documentation that illustrates I was granted a forbearance period for my federal student loans for the period of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX in which XXXX has it reporting a 90-120 day late payment status. If my accounts were n't current during that period, I wouldn't/could n't have been granted a forbearance period.This information is not correct and per the FCRA [ section 623 ( a ) ( 2 ) ] ANY updated account information must be reflected on the credit report. It is also the Credit Reporting agencies responsibility to ensure that all credit reports are 100 % accurate, in which my accounts are not. A Forbearance period marks your monthly payments as current while you are not paying on your loans and mines are n't reflecting that. I ca n't have late/missed payments and be on forbearance simultaneously. My forbearance grant should be updated and reflected on my credit report. I spoke with a Federal loan servicing rep by the name of XXXX ( ID number XXXX-information in attachment ) at XXXX Eastern time on XX/XX/XXXX and she informed me that the dispute process was a 60 day process and that my dispute was still under progress ( would be completed at the beginning of XXXX ). She also stated that once the dispute process was complete the disputed information would be corrected, updated, and reflected on my credit report. I have attached documentation that illustrates that I was granted a general forbearance period for the time frame that XXXX and Equifax is reporting missed payments. This hassle of back and forth with the credit reporting agency and XXXX XXXX has caused tremendous financial suffering due to no fault of mine."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX keeps reporting falsified information to the the major credit bureau and/or bureaus. I continue to asked XXXX XXXX ( by certified mail ) to provide me with a copy of any documents bearing my signature. I also requested that XXXX XXXX to validate this falsified information.i have disputed with the major credit bureaus and comes back verified. How can something be verified if i didn't know it exist. I am contacting you to see if you can validate this account and if so provide me with any documents bearing my signature that they say had and hard for them to provide me with. It say on my credit report that XXXX XXXX provided them with an update XX/XX/2019 stating that i owe {$650.00} and that {$670.00} was charged off. Thank you in advance for your time! 

P.S Please look into this matter and not over this matter."
Checking or savings account,"I cancel my insurance policy with the XXXX and was told that I would received a refund back for the unused portion of my insurance in the amount of {$99.00}. I waited some time for the refund and didn't receive it. I called the insurance company and was told the refund was refunded back to my debit card ending XXXX. I advised to them I no longer had that account. They advised that the funds were sent to the bank and they still have the money. The XXXX sent and the money was approved and received to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX attached is this dispute is a copy of the receipt. I called Wells Fargo talked the first week of XX/XX/XXXX with a rep who advised my checking account was closed and he didn't see any funds being refunded and that the XXXX didn't really send the money. It "" may '' have been approved but they hadn't sent the money. The following day I called back my old insurance company. The rep said no the money was refunded and that can send me the proof it was sent and that the bank has it. Receiving the email.. I called back to Wells Fargo and talked with another rep that states that he saw the entry but since i don't have a checking account its just there when asked about why they didn't return the funds back since my checking account is closed. The rep couldn't give an answer other than they weren't aware of the fund being there. i explained this wasn't my first call and asked again if there is no checking account why didn't they return the funds back to the XXXX so they can cut me a check, which they are waiting on the bank to do. I got another excuse about showing that my account was closed when he had access to this information already."
Credit card or prepaid card,I was charged by a company in XX/XX/XXXX that should have never had my card. They ran the card 3 times. I disputed what I thought was all 3 charges on XX/XX/XXXX and 2 of the 3 we're resolved and credited back XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXXI called in to check on the 3rd charge and was informed that it wasn't disputed so they put in the dispute in XX/XX/XXXX for a charge of {$180.00}. This charge has still not been resolved as of XX/XX/XXXX. I call in every month because I am getting charged interest on this dispute and I'm being told that someone is escalating my account and that they need 3 to 5 business days. I get transferred around and put on hold and still don't have my money back or the interest I have been charged. 60+ days on a dispute is horrible customer service.
Debt collection,3 different collections I settled with portfolio Recovery to completely delete them from my account and I have proof and it has only updated to me paying some of it. When we paid for delete. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent to collections with portfolio should be deleted than 2 XXXX XXXX XXXX cards I paid for delete also I paid a XXXX XXXX XXXX which was settled for less and a XXXX XXXX settles for less
Credit card or prepaid card,"Capital One Case #.. XXXX Account Number... XXXX Date of transaction. .XX/XX/XXXX Merchant........ XXXX Merchant website... XXXX Disputed Amount.... {$460.00} Todays Date..... XX/XX/XXXX I am senior citizen and a veteran of the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I believe that I have been the victim of consumer fraud or at best highly deceptive business practices. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I ordered a product called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  '' from a website called XXXX/. The order number is # XXXX costing {$460.00}. The product failed to perform as advertised and was returned per instructions from XXXX customer service. The return was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX for a shipping cost of {$33.00}. 

The XXXX  transaction appeared on my Capital One credit card statement. On XX/XX/XXXX a dispute for {$460.00} was submitted with Capital One. At that point I had not heard from the XXXX merchant  regarding the return. 

I have requested a refund totally exactly what I paid to the XXXX merchant  of {$460.00}. The merchant  has refused to refund that amount. The merchant  would have you believe that I would spend {$33.00} to return a working device. That is ludicrous. This is exactly the self-serving claim one would expect from a deceptive merchant. The device was defective, and if not, then their advertising is fraudulent. This is cheaply made device that only runs on two batteries. 

Allow me to quote from the XXXX website as follows : "" For four years we have set a benchmark for reliability, safety and excellence in XXXX  equipment. All products come with a 30 day money-back policy and one year warranty against defects. '' I submitted the Capital One dispute in good faith for just cause. Yet here I am four months later and I am out-of-pocket {$500.00} ( {$460.00} + {$33.00} ) and I have absolutely nothing to show for it except for endless calls to Capital One. 

Per the request of Capital One, I have provided them with many documents multiple times. I will attempt to attach those documents. In XXXX I provided Capital One with the 3-page dispute information form which they sent to me. I completed and mailed that form to their return address provided on the envelope which was : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, UT. XXXX. Additionally, nine supporting documents were uploaded to Capital One with the following upload reference number : XXXX. 

Finally, after many months on XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Capital One stating that the case was closed because they lack information. As a result I am still seeking a refund of the disputed amount.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have a Capital One credit card that I have never been late on paying. Apparently, I had a charge from XXXX and wasn't sent a statement via email or mail, and never received a phone call. On XX/XX/2019 I found out I had a balance on this account through XXXX XXXX. After I saw this, I immediately went online and paid off the balance in an attempt to make my account current. However, I was notified by a representative of Capital One that their system sent out a report to XXXX   and XXXX that I was 30 days late, which has impacted my credit score.

I did contact XXXX and XXXX that same day to open an investigation to have the 30 day late notice removed from my credit report. Unfortunately, nothing was revised because I received a lengthy letter on XX/XX/2019 from XXXX showing that the 30 day delinquency is still on my credit report. 


Before this incident, I had a 100 % record of paying all of my creditors on time. Needless to say, this situation has lowered my credit score through no fault of mine."
Debt collection,"I XXXX makes a claim with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) that the following attached attempt to collect a debt is highly fraudulent. My personal information is being floated in what is known in the debt collection business as a "" Debt Pool '', whereas collection information is outdated and not even enforceable. The attached collection from Midwest Recovery Systems does not state that the debt is no longer enforceable, a stipulation by the Federal Trade Commission. The method of an illegal posting of a collection on my personal credit report, or an illegal collection against my rights of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act can not be tolerated. In Federal Trade Commission v. XXXX ( XX/XX/2009 ) the federal district court decided in favor of the Federal Trade Commission that a collection agency must operate within strict guidelines in the collection of a debt. The criteria are as follows : 1 ) The debt must still be enforceable within the state of procurement or where the original obligator resides, or a combination of both. 
2 ) The debt collector must be licensed and bonded if applicable within the state in which it is trying to collect, if the debt is collectable. 
3 ) The validation of debt ownership must be proved, without exception. 
There is no statement on the attached collection that the debt is no longer enforceable. The collection agency stipulates that XXXX obtained a judgment against me. By legal mandate, the docket number of the judgment must be listed as well as what county clerk 's office the judgment is filed with. In this case, there is no judgment. The statement saying "" This judgment may be forwarded to an attorney for execution '' is a complete falsehood. There can not be a lawsuit as the legal time limit to enforce a summary judgment action has passed. 
Even though the collection letter states that illegal, abusive, deceptive and unfair debt collections are illegal, this collection in its entirety is just that, a deceptive illegal attempt to collect a debt that is no longer enforceable. 
I demand that all my information be purged immediately by Midwest Recovery Systems and XXXX, and that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) take the necessary steps to sanction both companies for using such abusive collection tactics."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Today XX/XX/2019, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) left me a voicemail that I qualified for a {$8000.00} loan with 10 % APR, for 36 months with a $ XXXX monthly payment. That wasnt bad. I called back and the representative asked for my social security number in order to confirm my application which I did give him. He asked for my bank routing number since it was going to be a direct deposit loan. I actually did give him that. Then, he said that he would need my bank account login information ( username and password ) in order to get into my account. I was polite in refusing to yield to his request. He became rude and the tone of his voice increased, threatening that he wont give me the loan and I shouldnt call him back. Well, maam, {$8000.00} is a lot of money and I cant deposit it into your account without logging into your bank account, he said. I told him again politely that my login information should be my private thing. He told me not to call him again until Im ready to give him the information he needs. Call back tomorrow when you really need the money, he said and then ended the call. I was shocked and wondered how unprofessional this company was and decided to call again in order to ask if there were other options for me to get the loan. He picked up and said maam, if youre not ready to give me the login information, dont call this number again. He did hang up again for the second time. Few minutes later, I decided to call again and the company refused to answer. I called two more times. No answer. I came to a conclusion that XXXX XXXX XXXX is either a scam or it has a horrible customer service. Im still shocked. Also, this business is not same as PROSPER MARKETPLACE INC ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) because I called PROSPER MARKETPLACE INC and was able to confirm the differences."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2019 I received a stack of mail from Chase Banking, with whom I have never done business and do not intent to. Two pieces of this unexpected mail were to activate new debit cards for two fraudulent checking accounts opened in my name without my authorization. Three pieces were returned checks dated XX/XX/2019 from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( routing # XXXX ), which Ive never heard of, electronically deposited to the fraudulent accounts in the amounts of check # XXXX  {$900.00}, check # XXXX  {$750.00}, and check # XXXX {$800.00}. Three pieces were returned checks dated XX/XX/2019 deposited into the fraudulent checking accounts from The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX  ( routing # XXXX ), with whom I have an optional disability policy, checks were in the amounts of check # XXXX  {$1800.00}, check # XXXX   {$1900.00}, and check # XXXX  {$1600.00}. Two pieces of mail stated that these Chase bank accounts had been blocked and would soon close. I have no confirmation that these accounts have been closed, and no further information was given to me about the application to open these accounts or any further deposits/withdrawals. I have no claim numbers for these companies because this wasn't authorized by me. I studied my credit report and found unauthorized inquiries recently and fraudulent addresses."
Credit card or prepaid card,"This company utterly refuses to comply with the law regarding disputes for unauthorized purchases. I contacted this company initially on XX/XX/XXXX to advise of an unauthorized purchased through XXXX XXXX ... on XX/XX/XXXX I sent these people proof not only did I not make the purchase. They blocked my card on a weekend. And I spent two hours on the phone attempting to get a supervisor. These creeps have lied about the resolution date three times. Not only have I removed my payroll proceeds from the account. They keep charging me fees for an all but closed account. They lie over and over again about the date this matter is supposed to be closed. the initial resolution date was on XX/XX/XXXX they never responded to my inquiry then the date changed from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Now they are just not responding to my inquiries, they have not refunded my money, and are tacking on a bunch of service fees. the only reason this account hasn't been closed is that they keep dragging this matter out while charging me fees for a closed account, so even if they refund me, they have assessed fees to ensure that I won't. This is the second request and complaint, which is the only reason they pretend to reach out. they know i want this account closed yet they continue to bill unauthorized fees"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","This complaint submission is in regards to an Unauthorized Inquiry reported by CITI BANK NORTH AMERICA / THE HOME DEPOT. I have made attempts to rectify this matter with them directly as they have now been unresponsive. I have not done any business nor have any revolving accounts with them. CITI BANK NORTH AMERICA / THE HOME DEPOT is currently in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681. I spoke with a Supervisor in the Account Verification & Consumer Protection Department by the name of XXXX and XXXX. It was extremely difficult to obtain any information from them. I then obtained their Fax and Mailing address to forward them an Inquiry Validation letter. The Supervisor stated to send everything over and they will fax all correspondents to the number provided. A fax confirmation was received on both ends and I still haven't received a response since XX/XX/2019. It was confirmed through my fax machine that the Department had received the files ; however, after more then 15 days of notifying them, still no response. I specifically asked for proof of me agreeing with a signature or judgment by law stating I gave my legal consent to conduct any credit inquiry. I have never made any agreement with them nor plan to in the future due to the poor service I received to rectify this matter. I am requesting CITI BANK NORTH AMERICA / THE HOME DEPOT immediately remove me from their systems, remove the Hard Inquiry on me, and update all 3 major Credit Bureaus ( XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX ) on this action. At this point they have failed to provide any competent evidence or any legal obligation. Once again, CITI BANK NORTH AMERICA / THE HOME DEPOT is currently in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 USC 1681, and if this report is not updated immediately I will be taking legal actions."
Student loan,"My student loans ' deferment was ending in XX/XX/XXXX and so in XX/XX/XXXX I paid off the accrued interest so it would n't capitalize. FedLoan Servicing first mistakenly applied the entire payment to one loan instead of all interest across all loans. It took 2 months and several phone calls to get the payment applied correctly retroactively. Several people told me they 'd would fix it but either nothing changed. Once that situation was resolved in noticed my repayment terms were not recalculated. It took countless calls before a customer service rep finally understood what I was talking about. I do not feel like many reps are qualified to discuss loans. After that call my repayment was recalculated but the monthly bill was still incorrect. In my subsequent conversations I have simply been asking for a repayment schedule but all they can provide me is the repayment terms ( which takes XXXX business days for some reason ). The problem with the terms is the terms never reconcile to the monthly payment. The outstanding loan amount, interest rate, and repayment length always equal a different min payment than on the same summary. Some are too high, some are too low. I feel like I can never talk to someone who knows what they are talking about."
Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX alleges that I signed up for classes with their institution. This could not be further from the truth. I have never been to their website until recently, when Ability Recovery Services , LLC stated that I owed XXXX XXXX an alleged debt of {$1600.00}. I disputed this fraudulent debt with XXXX XXXX and Ability Recovery Services, only to be provided with documents purporting that I signed up. However, I filed all the required and necessary affidavit and reports to show that this is and was a fraudulent account. 

Nevertheless, XXXX XXXX is still, by and through ability, attempting to collect on this fraudulent debt. Moreover, they are using a company that is not registered in the State of Michigan as required. Ability Recovery Services , LLC ( a Pennsylvania LLC ), doing business in Michigan, is attempting to collect on an alleged debt, which I have clearly stated is a fraudulent debt. Ability, through the XXXX  in PA, sent me multiple documents from XXXX XXXX to validate the debt, but, as I stated, it is not my debt and I have filled out all the required paperwork, affidavits and reports. They are also reporting the fraudulent debt to my credit reports, which has caused my score to drop. They have multiple addresses listed, which I have attempted to send certified mail to their address with the PA Secretary of State, but they have been returned. Ability lists three physical addresses. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, PA XXXX Ability Recovery Services , LLC is not registered with the State of Michigan to conduct business here. I am not saying that they need to be a licensed collection agency, but they do need to be registered with the state in order to transact business here, and they have not. Their website clearly states that they collect in all 50 states, and further claim that they are bonded and insured nationwide. They have never filed for an Application for Certificate of Authority to Transact Business in Michigan, they have no Registered Agent in Michigan, and yet they continue to flaunt the laws of this state and the State of Pennsylvania. 

Their illegal business practices need to be investigated at once, so more Michiganders are not put in the situation of dealing with such an unscrupulous company, who willingly, willfully and knowingly violates numerous Federal and State Statutes."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I paid off my two credit cards with. Contiental finance card company. I paid way over the amount i owed to keep my accoubts open. They keep reporting to XXXX XXXX   XXXX the credit bureaus that i am over the kimit abd late. After i paid the cards i cut them up. The only fees i have is the monthy fees of XXXX that they are forcing me to pay to keep the account open.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","My identity has been compromised, and that lead to unauthorized accounts on my credit report, accounts such as 1 ) XXXX XXXX   {$490.00} 2 ) XXXX XXXX XXXX {$270.00} 3 ) XXXX XXXX XXXX 4 )  XXXX XXXX XXXX {$390.00} 5 ) XXXX/  XXXX XXXX XXXX Please investigate this and send me the Method of Verification used, or remove the accounts immediately."
Checking or savings account,"On on XXXX I made a payment to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$15.00}, but also made another purchase which dropped my account lower than I realized. The next morning I made a {$40.00} deposit to my bank to cover all transactions, and noted that the {$15.00} had been debited from my account and I was still in the positive on my account. On XXXX I noted an overdraft fee on my account, as nothing should have been debited from my account I called BB & T to ask what the fee was. That was when I was told that the XXXX XXXX fee had bounced and caused the overdraft. I explained that the amount had been cleared as of noon the XXXX, without issues and that I did not have their overdraft program that allowed them to pay out purchases if my account was short. The lady, XXXX XXXX, confirmed this and could not explain what had happened, only that it was valid and I wouldnt get my money back, she even chuckled about the situation at the time. I explained that the last fee was returned in XX/XX/17 when I had called my former car insurance and three-wages called the bank to prove that they had made an error and that, that return of fee should not count against me as that was their fault. The woman again stated I would not be getting a refund before I hung up. I also reached out to their social media accounts and received the same answer but no one could explain why it had both cleared and caused a bounce check fee. Can this be looked into? I feel as though my bank stole from me and it doesnt make me feel comfortable with them anymore."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",This company is committing credit reporting fraud. They have changed the date of the repossession on my credit report from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX with 120-180 recent reoccurring late payments. Initially it reflected open with the same late payments after reaching out to this organization as well as many others this company continues to use Equifax reporting system to victimize me with inaccurate information. I am in fear of this company and how it continues to use Equifax to openly conduct fraudulent credit activity against my Equifax credit reporting and I want something done I demand they be restricted from accessing my credit report to continue to be allowed to illegally report inaccurate information knowingly. Ive been in constant dispute over the account since XXXX when they refused to document the cars resale this company has to be stopped. Why are they being allowed to use a company we rely upon for accurate credit reporting to be allowed to utilize the reporting system to victimize consumers. I demand this company to be removed from my credit report and blocked from accessing my credit report I am in the process of filing a police report against them as we speak for the immediate crimes being allowed by Equifax.
Mortgage,"I took out a HELOC in XX/XX/XXXX against my principal property. I paid that loan off on XX/XX/XXXX but somehow I ended up having a {$0.00} ( XXXX cent  balance ). Because of the outstanding interest rate on the HELOC ( 2.99 % ), I was advised to keep the loan open instead of closing it at that time, incuffing an annual fee of {$25.00} to keep the line open. I have paid each year in XX/XX/XXXX via a direct payment from my checking account at another bank. At the end of last year, I was notified that the HELOC was coming to the end of the draw period. I called to close the account and was told that they could not take a {$0.00} cent payment via transfer. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill from the bank stating that I owed {$37.00} including a {$37.00} late fee. I called CS and requested that the fee be waived, which I was told would take 3-5 business days for a response. I was also told I would need to pay a {$74.00} fee to have the Lien Released on my property. I was able to may a  payment from my other back checking account of {$1.00} to make sure I have no more balance on the Line of Credit. I called XXXX County Controller 's office and was told that the fee for the bank to release the Lien is {$54.00}. I reviewed my HELOC contract which states I may only be  charged a release fee equal to the amount of the 3rd party fee ( which in this case would be the Controller 's office ). 
Today, I called the bank back to see the outcome of my request to have the fee waived. The bank did waive the fee, but I only found this out by talking to a supervisor, because the initial CS agent told me it was denied. I also explained to the supervisor that XXXX County Controller 's office stated the fee is {$54.00}, not {$74.00}. She said that XXXX County "" has not notified the bank of any fee changes ''. After paying the the {$73.00} balance, I asked how I would receive my refund for the extra {$20.00} payment to the Controller 's office, and she stated that if the bank received a refund from the controller 's office that it would be forwarded to me. ( I have a very hard time believing that this will take place. ) Cudo 's to the Lender for waiving the crazy {$37.00} fee. 
They could have done a much better job explaining the Fee to "" Close the account '', and there is the issue of the discrepency between what the Controller 's office told me and what the back is charging."
Debt collection,"I satisfied my debt on XX/XX/XXXX.  The law office that handled the collection placed a lien on my home and as of XX/XX/XXXX, the lien has not been removed.  This has prevented me from obtaining title insurance and prevented me from selling my home.My county recorders office informed me that the law office had improperly completed an Acknowledgement of Satisfaction of Judgement and therefore, the lien cannot be removed.I contacted the law office on XX/XX/XXXX and informed me of the problem.  They told me to have the title company send them a ""demand in escrow"" which they did immediately.  The law office never responded to this demand.  I have contacted the law office numerous times but they will not respond to any of my e-mails.  I finally received a response on XX/XX/XXXX where XXXX XXXX, director of operations stated that they would re-file the proper documentation but only after their notary returns the following week but to date, nothing has been filed and the law office won't return e-mails or give me any updates.  I reported the lawyer to the  California State Bar for misconduct and I sent a copy of the complaint to the lawyer.  I received an e-mail from the lawyer in 11 minutes stating that they intended to file the correct paperwork however, this has not been done as of this date.  This is holding up the sale of my home and I have now lost the pending sale.  My debt was satisfied 3 years ago and the Lawyer has the obligation to remove the lien from my property.  California law requires the lien to be removed within 15 days of the debt being paid off."
Checking or savings account,"On XXXX XXXX early in the morning, I notified Bank of America that my car had been broken into and my wallet have been stolen. The theft happened at dawn at the gym I attend and as soon as I was done with the Police and returned home I reported to BOA that i have been a victim of identity theft. I requested them to cancel my ATM card and block access to my checking account. The very next day, the thieves were given access to my full account balance and were able to withdraw and overdraft my bank account. BOA failed with their security measures. The thieves use my FL Drivers License and possibly my ATM card. I know this because I talked to the branch manager of the location where the thief made her appearance. Over the course of the past months, I have had numerous conversations over the phone requesting information on my case. I was told than an analyst investigating the case will call me and that calll has never happened. After receiving no response, on XXXX XXXX I submitted via fax a formal letter requesting BOA to explain how they failed to secure my account, implement extra security measures in my new account and make the funds they have frozen available to us, the account holders. I attached to this request the Police Report from XXXX XXXX, proof of my identity and a copy of the Notice to Furnishers of Information provided by the FTC when I file my identity theft report. BOA only responded until XXXX XXXX by email. The notified me that the claim will not be honored and that the temporary credit issued on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX of {$1800.00} will be reversed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called to ask about all the documentation I submitted on XXXX the XXXX but the documents were nowhere to be found on the case. I immediately resubmitted the documents via fax and certified-signature required mail. I requested to respond within 5 business days. XXXX XXXX and again today, XXXX XXXX I called to check on the status of the claim and the received documents but once again BOA did not have them on record. I had to send them again today ... now for the 6th time. I was told again, that the analyst will call me. As of today is almost 6 months after my identity and money has been stolen and BOA has still to provide an explanation on how they failed to secure my account, failed to follow up on the investigation, failed to follow up on the documents I 've provided and failed to give me a resolution so I can put this behind and move on. BOA is consuming a lot of my time. I am hours away from them taking out funds from my bank account again and zero answers."
Debt collection,I have been attempting to resolve issues regarding 2 items that are negatively being reported to my credit files ; which is hindering my ability to obtain new lines of credit and having a major negative impact on my credit score making it impossible to secure loan for the purpose to purchase property. I do not owe Il XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX any monies ; prior to negative reporting to all 3 credit bureaus I was unaware of this account/ collection.

I 've been dealing with this for so many months thrown between the hospital, debt collectors, and credit bureaux and no one wan na fix this."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I bought a car on XX/XX/2019 just over 2 weeks ago with {$1000.00} down and {$500.00} deferred. They did not disclose that there was a GPS tracking/disabling device on the vehicle. They started out telling to just get my insurance as soon as possible then the very first Tuesday or Wednesday they already disabled the vehicle saying that I was supposed to have my insurance within 24 hours, if I would have known it was 24 hours I would not have tried to wait until payday on the following Friday, I would have done my insurance immediately. Then come Saturday the XX/XX/XXXX they have disabled my car again because I paid {$300.00} of the {$500.00} deferred amount that was due that day. Then I lost a contact that couldnt be replaced over the weekend because ai did not even have access to my prescription over the weekend. I did not order glasses at the time because XXXX XXXX could not connect with my government XXXX/XXXX XXXX and were trying to charge me too much money. Anyway when I paid the {$300.00} one of the sales people at Texas Auto Center assisted me in making the {$300.00} payment in their payment ATM and I said I would pay the rest as soon as I made it with XXXX and XXXX, he did not argue or say anything at the time. Then Monday morning at the optometrist they start harassing phone calls and disabled the vehicle. The period of time the {$200.00} was late and the disabling of my vehicle is absolutely ridiculous and the harassing phone calls starting the very next business day is very extreme! Texas Auto Center in XXXX XXXX, TX needs to extend that period of time before they start harassing their customers and disabling their vehicle to allow for a more fair period of time and give honest customers a chance to make things right. They constantly lie and give their customers the run around. I have been reading their customer complaints and reviews on the XXXX XXXX XXXX website and have since come to the conclusion that their business practices are highly shady and their consumers need protection from these sharks that most of them do not know where to solicit."
Debt collection,"I took a payday loan out and was paying back on time on a regular basis. About 2 or 3 months ago I switched banks, I called them and asked to have the debt deductions taken out of new bank. They said it was to late for the next payment, but could after that. I tried to explain to them that I will get a charge because that account was closed. Was getting nowhere with the person I was talking to, so I asked to talk to a supervisor-he kept stating that the supervisor would tell me the same thing. Over and over this went over probably ten times, he didnt seem like he would transfer me, so I hung up. After that expierence dicided not to even try to deal with them anymore. I'm getting calls and emails from them."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019 I completed a preapproval application with XXXX XXXX for a new vehicle loan. This was a preapproval, soft credit pull. I verified this with a real person at location. On XX/XX/2019 I applied for the loan and was approved and purchased the new vehicle. On XX/XX/2019 I was called by XXXX XXXX and asked to unlock my credit report again. I did not understand why I needed to unlock for the second time but It was explained to me by the sales manager, the salesperson as well as the FINANCE MANAGER that only 1 inquiry would result overall. Much to my surprise on XX/XX/2019 I received another hard inquiry from Honda Finance and also my contract had to be rewritten and resigned. I only ever authorized 1 inquiry. I contacted XXXX XXXX regarding this and am still waiting on the promised phone call that's never going to happen. Honda Finance representative told me when I called in to get a copy of the contract in regards to the second inquiry, "" her supervisor said thats just the way it is '' and this can be verified because the calls are alledegly recorded for quality assurance. 

I tried disputing the inquiry for Honda Finance with XXXX  but was told by rep that Honda Finance would have to submit electronically a form to remove the inquiry. This is shady business practices and I will share my story to impact Hondas sales. 

Thanks so much for your time."
Debt collection,"I contacted the original creditor that they claimed to have had a file number for after setting up a payment arrangement prior with this company Scheer, Green , & Burke, Co LPA which I called back and told them that I knew my rights they had to provide to me within 5 days validation of this debt that I was not paying this that I spoke to the original creditor and they have no knowledge of me in there account whatsoever. The law office tried to claim that they would not have that record and I told them by law they can not collect a debt after a due expiration date if I can not validate the debt. This is a scam I told them that I was reporting them to you all as well. I am in the middle of obtaining a mortgage for my first home and I am scared to death. The original creditor said that if that debt was valid that I would have already had a mark on my credit report which I do not. Can someone please help. They are stating that I have to give them a settlement amount on XX/XX/XXXX I close on my home XX/XX/XXXX or a few days after. They are claiming this is for an emergency room visit of XX/XX/XXXX of last year. I also spoke with the attorney generals office and they told me that its probably a scam and to fill out there form."
Mortgage,"Hi, I have a very urgent matter once again due to a foreclosure sale on XX/XX/2019. I applied for a loan modification to Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC numerous times before and they always prolong the process. Never gave an offer and never accepted my loan modification. Ever since then I have been trying to get a loan modification and I can not get one from this company. I mailed in my rma packet and all required documentation as per guidelines. Im in a loan modification review as they should have requested documents for a review. From the past Ive had trouble calling Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC to ask about any status or updates for the loan modification and a status on the loan modification I get nowhere. I call in, the phone system asks for my social security number or my loan number, I put in the loan number and or social security number, it rings couple of times and then it goes straight to a common voicemail. It says thank you for calling the underwriting department please leave a message or set up a time to call you back. Ive tried multiple times to set up the call back and never got a callback and the other times their phone system just hung up on me. I would try this couple more times at different times in the day and get the same results. These are the numbers I have called to get in contact with anyone at Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX all and each phone number has the same process. As soon as I input my loan number it seems like their system registers my loan number and does not transfer me to a live person at Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC but transfers me straight to a voicemail. I feel like this is international so that I would not be able to speak with any of the Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC representatives and to prevent me from getting a loan modification. This feels like a very big problem that they do this. I can not speak with anyone regarding my loan thus iam not able to know the status of the loan modification and I can not move forward. In the past I had this issue as well and it has not been addressed. In the past this has happened multiple times on multiple days and each one does this until I clicked the number 0 for a very long and tedious process I finally got someone. But now it does not work and it goes straight to a voicemail which even after leaving voicemails to be called back I never get any call backs. If Im not mistaken Bayview Loan Servicing , LLC is in violation of my Homeowner Bill of Rights. Seems like they do not want to help me but to just sell my home."
Debt collection,"I am lodging a formal complaint against ra rogers Inc collections.

I have never been associated with this credit Union in my life. I have lived in XXXX XXXX NJ my whole life. I have never received anything in the mail from this company advising me of this balance.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, GA XXXX  XXXX   Experian Re : Chapter XXXX  Bankruptcy To Whom It May Concern : I am disturbed that you continue to list the dismissed bankruptcy as confirmed within my crediti file. Although it is your policy to keep reporting bankruptcies that are filed, dismissed or adjudicated for ten years, the Fair credit Reporting Act mentions nothing in Section 1681c relating to bankruptcy about dismissals or filings. The law clearly states from "" date of adjudication '' or date of "" order of relief ''.

Any case, civil or otherwise, which is dismissed no longer exists in the eye of the law and a case filed may never have actually been adjudicated. Therefore, you have no right to maintain information which the government has deemed nonexistent.

Therefore, pursuant to Section 1681 ( a ) ( 5 ) of the FCRA, you must delete this information from my credit report and send me an updated copy when this action is completed.

Considering that this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate your response within 14 calendar days from receipt of this letter.

Again I never paid or walked into court for such a matter and by law it does not exists"
Mortgage,"I have had a very difficult time with SPS. I have tried to submit for a loan modification several times. I was never able to communicate to the same person which always caused confusion. SPS always seemed to lose my paperwork, which I constantly had to re-fax. When I finally was approved I unfortunately was unable to make trial payments because I got furloughed. When I reapplied SPS said I was not longer eligible for a loan modification. When I called them and asked to fo a short sale they told me I was not allowed to apply for a short sale. Then SPS placed a foreclosure sale date on my property. I simply want to avoid a foreclosure and move on. A foreclosure will destroy my credit for 7 years, and will cause me another major hardship."

The representative I spoke to was located in the XXXX. I have not consented to having my credit information shared with call centers outside of the United States. I'm concerned about how my personal information and privacy is protected in third countries with weak contract enforcement and weak rule of law.

I filed a Police Report with the XXXX police department today, I can provide a report number if needed. I called my bank back to file a new claim today with the police report number, but the claims department told me they couldn't help me, no one in the department could because Capitol One and XXXX claim no responsibility for scams or having their customers backs. They offered me no other recourse except with the police. I asked to speak with a supervisor and they stated they would tell me the exact same thing. And XXXX would tell me a similar thing. I also put in a claim with the Federal Trade commission and received an email back with links to online shopping ( not helpful ) At this point this is my last ditch effort to get any or all of my money back I lost during this scam. So at this point my bank told me they can't help me, XXXX can't help me, and the other people that maybe can help is the police department. As a consumer, banking customer, credit card holder etc I am hoping that I can feel protected in some way regards to having been scammed and violated in this way."

I am again asked for 3rd reinstatemnet but extreme worried that doesn't matter how do we comply with the law and Fay 's instructions, that it is a scan, that Fay will uses my fund to invest making profits, and misleading, scheme me to believe that my loan will be reinstated once the wired fund received. 
Fay send me the augumented of {$250000.00} to reinstated my loan by XX/XX/XXXX. I am waiting for my deposited check cleared to cut the check forwarding to Fay before XX/XX/XXXX. 
Fay eventually refunded my wired fund on XX/XX/XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX Fay Cashed my check more than 3 month even after Fay forclosed on my home on XX/XX/XXXX."
Vehicle loan or lease,"GM Financial provided certificate # XXXX for four months lease pull ahead for use if I purchase or lease a new vehicle by XX/XX/2019.

Vehicle loan or lease,"I Leased this car from Ally Financial for 3 years with the option to purchase at the end of the lease. towards the end of the lease I started calling the bank to ask for the option to purchase the car because I wanted to keep the car. They started running my credit every time I called them and begged them to please sell it to me because that was the only transportation I had to go to work ( See credit inquire history attached ) Once they noticed that the amount owned in xtra miles was greater than the value of the car in XXXX   XXXX, Ally started demanded me to pay the amount owned in xtra miles. I was forced to go get another car loan to have transportation to go to work. On XX/XX/2017 After trying multiple times to get financing through different car dealers, I ended up in the XXXX dealer and when they run my credit and search for financial institutions one of the banks that came back offering me a car loan was Ally. Same bank that totally denied me the option to purchase the car I leased from them because of my bad credit was willing to finance me my new car loan. I fell that I was victim of FRAUD with this bank. Plus because all the multiple inquires I was forced to take a 16 % interest rate on my new loan. The government shouldn't allow this companies to still from their good clients. I was offer a Lease with a purchase option and they did not comply at the end of the contract.

This should not be affecting my credit because I comply with every payment until the end of the contract.

I really hope I find someone that will legally educate me as to what my options are to get out of this problem since I comply until the last payment. Ally Broke the contract by denying the option to purchase the car at the end of the lease as they had promised when I got it. How can they call this Lease with option to buy? don't let them fool you."
Mortgage,"I have a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. I decided to get ahead and start a biweekly payment schedule to make an extra principle only payment annually. According to Wells Fargo 's website : "" ... When you split your payments like this, you're making the equivalent of 1 extra monthly payment ... This extra payment is applied directly to your principle balance. '' I started biweekly payments on XX/XX/XXXX and it is now XX/XX/XXXX. Only 1/2 of a monthly payment was applied to principle only on XX/XX/XXXX. There was not another principle only transaction during this period of over 1 year ( 35 1/2 payments ). I any given 12 months only 12 payment are due, or 24 1/2 payments. I made 26 half payments, which is 1 full payment over what I owed. A full principle only payment should have been applied at some point during that year of 26 payments. I am at 35 half payments with only 1/2 payment being applied directly to principle. I contacted Wells Fargo and they responded saying their actions are correct even though it conflicts with information on their website. They said 3 payments have to be made within one month in order to apply a payment to principle only. I don't feel like this practice is fair because on XX/XX/XXXX there was a payment made that could have been applied to principle only and the payments made on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX would have satisfied the XX/XX/XXXX balance due within the grace period. This arbitrary rule of 3 payments within one month caused me to pay more interest in XXXX than I did in XXXX, which, should be impossible considering I have a fixed rate loan and have never missed a payment."

I was told upon opening this account that I would be allotted 6 months from my first statement to pay the balance off. That would be my XXXX statement ( which is still not generated online ).

Debt collection,"I XXXX XXXX have made several requests for proof that a creditor once originated with a national financial institution that has FDIC insurance can sell off a debt that is part of a securitized trust. Then these same debt buyers that used to be known as collection agencies could re-assign the debt to a fourth party for collection enforcement. This process of stating that debts are being purchased by a third party and then enforced by a fourth party is the larges scam in America. The U. S. Supreme Court decision in XX/XX/2017 known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is responsible for this scam. This decision basically states that since a third party purchases the debt, that my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is VOID. The problem is that almost all unsecured debts are sold off to XXXX XXXX in various traunces in securitized trusts. There simply is no resolution where the debt can be purchased, only that the debt can be assigned for collection purposes. Each financial institution must file a 10Q filing quarterly with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The rules on debts being charged off is with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation through the FDIC Act, Code 5000. A debt can be classified either standard or sub-standard. Debts over 180 days late must go into the sub-standard category and written off on a quarterly 10Q SEC filing. These charge 0ffs usually are submitted in the tens of millions of dollars. So its virtually for these debts to be sold..period. Accordingly, I request full validation proving the debt purchase. Secondly, I will entertain a very low settlement agreement to put my dispute to rest. All of the settlements can be submitted through the CFPB portal email address submitted. I am still within my rights under the FDCPA since proof of a purchase to a third party has never been established."

Mortgage,"Last year Wells Fargo ran an article in The XXXX XXXX stating that they had incorrectly foreclosed on several homes from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, as a computer glitch on loan modifications caused them to deny these people loan modifications.

Since this applied to me I called them.After several discussions on the phone spanning several months of delays on their part, they sent me a letter stating they had not made any mistakes on the denial of my loan modification back in XX/XX/XXXX.In the denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX they stated that it was determined that I could not afford a repayment.Therefore I would not be included in their settlement efforts. ( in their original denial letter dated XX/XX/XXXX they stated that my pending loan modification required approval from the investor that ultimately owns my mortgage, and the investor has declined the request to modify my mortgage??? ). Their XX/XX/XXXX letter of denial misses all of the following facts of my XX/XX/XXXX case : 1. I requested with Wells Fargo home specialist XXXX XXXX a 30 year loan in place of my current 15 year loan # XXXX for my rental property at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ca XXXX.XXXX told me that I had to be in the HARP program to get a loan modification??? This was not the product I was looking for, but XXXX instructed me to send in payments for the equivalent of the new 30 year loan while he handled all the paperwork. 
2.XXXX then had me send in mountains of paperwork over the next several months, all the while delaying my final 30 year loan papers I was ready to sign.Earlier the year before Wells Fargo had granted me this very same loan on my property ( home ) at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Nv loan #  XXXX. ( Later in XX/XX/XXXX California passed a law against Dual Tracking of loans ). 
3.Since XXXX was having me send in only 1/2 the required payment, Wells was sending me  delinquency notices which XXXX said to not worry about. 
4. As this dual tracking continued, I was instructed by XXXX to quit sending in payments at all.This concerned me, so I contacted Senator XXXX XXXX off to help me with this.XXXX XXXX and I then began working with several Wells reps like XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX -- Executive Mortgage Specialist.Again, XXXX and I sent in all the paperwork as instructed to meet all their requirements ( it was a XXXX XXXX loan and XXXX even worked with them to insure correct procedures were followed ) ' 5. During a conference call in XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of Wells Fargo told XXXX and I that it was too late to pay off the loan or even bring it current, that since the loan was now over 3 months late, the foreclosure would not be stopped.There was at that time over {$200000.00} in equity in this property I was counting on for retirement. 
Again, in the denial letter from Wells  dated XX/XX/XXXX, it was stated that their computers determined I could not make the loan modification payment.As stated above I had already been paying on a 15 year loan and only wanted to go to a 30 year loan.Thus my contention that I was fraudulently forclosed on, just like the other people in their proposed settlement.

Credit card or prepaid card,"This claim involves the claims filed by me ( XXXX ) and on my behalf by the California Department of Business Oversight ( XXXX ) against Chase Bank. The currently pending claims involve fraudulent charges made on my credit card in a foreign country. The pending claims provide detailed information regarding Chase Banks intentional evasiveness, delay tactics, and refusal to resolve my matter. 

Shortly after the above-mentioned claims were filed with the CFPB, Chase Bank engaged in retaliatory behavior against me. With at least the knowledge of the claim filed by the California Department of Business Oversight ( CDBO ) ( which was submitted on XX/XX/2019 ), and possibly also the knowledge of the claim I filed on XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank first closed the matter that was the basis for the claims ( despite their being open claims with the CFPB ), and then restricted my online access to my account. 

Chase Bank informed me that it was closing my matter in a letter dated XX/XX/2019 just two days after I submitted my CFPB complaint, and 12 days after the CDBO submitted a complaint on my behalf. The XX/XX/XXXX letter contained material misstatements regarding which charges I am disputing. Chase Bank then restricted online access to my bank account, disabling certain features and preventing me from using the over 300,000 points Ive accumulated as a Chase Bank customer. In multiple instances, when I tried to access my online account, a prompt stated that my email address had been changed to XXXX and that access was forbidden. 

I believe Chase Bank closed my matter and restricted access to my account because of the claims the CDBO and I filed with the CFPB. Chase Bank is aware of the amounts I owe, and that those amounts are significant to me. Chase Bank is also aware that the issues involved in the recently closed matter are the same issues that form the basis for the claims filed with the CFPB. 

Chase Bank unrestricted access to my account after my attorney placed two unanswered calls and two unanswered emails to the Chase Executive Fraud Department, as well as one unanswered call to the Chase Fraud Department. Chase Bank returned my attorneys calls, on XX/XX/2019. My attorney spent 30 minutes speaking with the Fraud Department, 10 minutes on hold, and 20 minutes speaking with a representative in the Customer Service Department. The Chase Fraud Department referred my attorney to the Customer Service Department because the Fraud Department only deals with fraud.

During my attorneys call with the Chase Fraud Department, the Chase Bank agent ( XXXX XXXX ) told my attorney that if he wanted access to the audio recordings referenced in Chase Banks XX/XX/2019 letter to me ( written by XXXX XXXX ) he would need to subpoena that information. The letter specifically mentioned that certain audio recordings were germane to my matter being closed and the fraudulent charges being upheld. The audio recordings mentioned in the XX/XX/2019 letter had never previously been mentioned over the course of the eight months Ive been disputing the charges. 

After being referred by the Fraud Department to the Customer Service Department, the Customer Service Department informed my attorney that he would again need to include me on a call to verify that my attorney is who he says he is ; however, on multiple occasions, I had already provided Chase Bank with confirmation that my attorney represents me, both orally and in writing. Whats more, the Fraud Department had just spoken about my matter at length with my attorney right before connecting my attorney to the Customer Service Department. 

Both the Fraud Department and the Customer Service Department told my attorney that a security hold had been placed on my online account. The Customer Service Department revealed that security holds are put in place when there has been a suspected security breach. There was no suspected security breach. The Customer Service Department said that the security hold would be in place until I received a new card for the account on which the fraudulent charges had been made but I received that new card ( and a new account number ) over 8 months ago, and Chase Bank knew this. 

Shortly after my attorney ended the call with the Chase Bank Customer Service Department, my attorney received a call from the Chase Executive Fraud Department. The Executive Fraud Department again confirmed that there was a security hold on my account, and that they would need to reach out to the Security Department to determine why the hold was in place. They told my attorney they would call him back when the Executive Fraud Department heard from the Security Department this was yet another delay tactic consistent with the pattern of behavior complained of in the previously filed CFPB complaints. 

The Executive Department also again refused to send my attorney the audio recordings that formed the basis for Chase Bank upholding the fraudulent charges to my account. The Executive Fraud Department did, however, at my attorneys forceful request, agree to send him a typed summary of the recordings. The Executive Department iterated that if my attorney wanted the actual audio recordings, he would need to send a subpoena request to their National Subpoena Processing Department. This is still another example of the  kind of institutionally embedded delay tactics and clandestine coercion used by Chase Bank to prevent opposition to its decisions. 

Chase Bank recorded all of my phone conversations with its agents, not for customer service purposes, but to now egregiously misrepresent those conversations as evidence for upholding the fraudulent charges. Chase Bank is withholding those audio recordings to prevent me from defending my claims. Apparently Chase Bank has built into its business model various ramparts of time-consuming and burdensome steps that prevent its clients from accessing mutual information related to its clients claims against the bank. 

Later, and still on XX/XX/2019, my attorney and I called Chase Bank to, once again, verify my attorneys identity ; we were then able to confirm that the bank had, evidently within the past few hours, removed the online restrictions on my account. The Executive Fraud Department did not contact me nor did they contact my attorney to mention that the restrictions were lifted. This tends to show the security hold was retaliatory. 

In the letter Chase Bank sent me on XX/XX/2019, Chase Bank demanded that I pay the amounts that form the basis for the claims filed with the CFPB. I maintain that I do not owe the amounts Chase Bank asserts I owe because those charges were fraudulent, and the claims with the CFPB have not been resolved. 

I believe Chase Bank retaliated against me to discourage me from continuing to dispute the charges and to punish me for continuing to object to their egregious institutional practices and conduct ( e.g., their delay tactics ) related to those charges."

I wrote XXXX XXXX about this matter and ask them to provide proof of said account. Well the time they said has come and go and I also wrote them another letter with no response.

I demand to see Verifiable proof ( an original Consumer Contract with my signature on it ) you have on file of the account in question. Your failure to positively verifiy this account has hurt my ability to obtain credit.

Upon calling for an update on XX/XX/2018, I discovered that the agent did not remove them as promised- despite me furnishing Equifax with the identity theft report, confirmation # XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019 my credit score was 679-690. I filled a dispute on Experian and XXXX to verify that an old XXXX account was in fact closed. After I disputed requesting proof that and old XXXX account was closed or if it was still charge off I was notified within 2 days by XXXX that account was still in charge off. That information was posted to my credit report and caused my score to drop 40 points. The information posted was no different than whats been on my report for years. 

Ive worked hard, really really hard, for 5 years to build my credit score up. REALLY HARD. For my score to drop like this over an account dispute is despicable and wrong. I contact Experian and XXXX  both were not helpful. 

I explained that I Only was trying to verify information. And they said they couldnt do anything to fix my score. But that, that shouldnt have happened because no, new information was being reported. They said to wait a month and see if it resolves on its own and brings my score back up to where it was. Its been a month. Nothing has changed. Please fix."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Im a second year XXXX XXXX. I served my country and ran into tough times when my wife get laif off. As a XXXX XXXX ive been exposed to the beauty that is American law, mainly the constutution. In my opinion the second greatest document written behind the XXXX. I see a tragedy. The federal reserve system ( fractional illegal banking ) most Americans have no idea how our banking system works let alone the federal Reserve. It literally is the greatest ponzi scheme in history. Its completely unconstitutional and has created a disportion of wealth where the majority are slaves to banks. No where in our constitution does it state an independent banking system issuing these federal reserve notes that are now practical worthless has any authority, nor use our federal taxes as collateral against these loans. Then the big banks have devised perfect system that manipulate money and creates it out of thin air through credit. Its pathetic. Its made the rich richer and the poor poorer. Im going to stop my save the world speech and say this. XXXX  followed tax law and im asking XXXX and Transunion to follow suit and do what united state federal tax law tells one to do in the following situation. Im asking every single one of my creditors to follow the United States tax law with regards to debt. I want every single one of my creditors who wrote off my debt as a loss on their tax returns and recouped their money to remove that debt from XXXX and Transunion. The Federal tax law states "" Attempting to collect such monies, fees, etc. for an unsecured debt that has been claimed on federal taxes as a loss, and sold to another company for compensation constitutes fraud in any of the 50 states. '' It makes sense and all my creditors didnt hide they wrote it off. I want these collection companies who have no legal claim to this debt that again has been written off removed from my credit report and in reality they themselves are commiting tax fraud by trying to collect on these debts that no longer belong to me off my credit report. This is the law. Its not enforced but it should be. Big banks have lawyers who know tax law and get their clients to pay little to no taxes. XXXX followed the law and removed these items from my ctedit report. Since its the law I expect transunion and XXXX  to do the same or they to are commiting fraud."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am writing to complain about Equifax because I have written to them twice since XX/XX/XXXX stating that the information in my credit report showed credit inquiries that I do not recall authorizing.

Debt collection,"Hsbc bank is trying to collect funds I do not owe them, in XX/XX/2018 I had a balance of {$3800.00}, I went online to make payment in full, I noticed that I set up the payment for XX/XX/XXXX which was my due date, that was a mistake as I wanted payment for XX/XX/XXXX, I went and looked at transaction history and the previous payment didnt show, so I went and made the payment for XX/XX/XXXX, this payment cleared my bank on XX/XX/XXXX, my account then had a XXXX balance, then I found on XX/XX/XXXX Hbsc sent an ach to my bank for {$3800.00} when I had a XXXX balance, this was rejected by my bank for insufficient funds, I called HBSC about this and spent near an hour on the phone because now my credit card showed a credit balance of - {$3800.00}, when I called they said well we can send you a check for the credit amount, I told them no do not do that because you never got that money from my bank, she said well it shows up here, I said youre not going to get the money, they said then call back after that showed on my account, I waited then I received a check for {$3800.00} in the mail, I called them again and told them what had happened and that they had then charged me a {$25.00} returned check fee and sent me a check, after another almost hour on phone this was supposed to all cleared up and they reversed the {$25.00} returned check fee, I also told them to cancel the credit card, so I shredded the check they had sent, shredded the credit card, then on XX/XX/XXXX I  received a statement from HSBC, I did not have my log in so I ignored it, mind you I have not received a statement since XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I started getting unknown XXXX calls and found out it was Hsbc, I called back and they said they were attempting to collect a debt and I owed them {$3800.00}, I told them this was supposed to be cleared and I shredded the check they sent and advised as to what happened, now they refuse to clear my account and the girl said they may have to send me another check and I would need to cash it and pay them again, I am in fear they send another check then they will say I owe them over 7000, I told them you are a bank, can you not see I never cashed the check and they should just put a stop pay on it and this would be cleared up, I dont know what more I can do"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426- chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and otherwise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form. 2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed. 4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit. 5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... .."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have been a victim of identity theft
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed there were 3 capital one accounts reporting on my credit report. 2 of them were accurate, and one of them did not belong to me. I mailed a letter to all 3 credit bureaus alerting them of the inaccurate account. I also stated in the letter that the other 2 accounts were accurate. By the end of XXXX I noticed the inaccurate capital one account was removed and so was one of my accurate accounts leaving only one capital one account reporting to all 3 bureaus. I called XXXX first to alert them of their mistake and they informed me that i needed to contact capital one in regards to this matter. I called capital one to inform them of the mistake and they stated that i should contact the credit bureaus. The Capital One representative also stated that they would be reporting after the XXXX of the month and i should give them a call back if i did not see the account on my report by the middle of XXXX. I didn't think much of it since my account was still open and i was still able to use my card. I logged into my online credit card account today, XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX and i was not able to view my personal credit card account information, however my business credit card information was available. I contacted Capital one around XXXX and the customer service representative informed me that my credit card account was closed do to fraudulence. There was no manager available for me to speak to about this incident. I have had this credit card open and in good standing for 2 years now and it is being closed in error due to the credit bureaus reporting fraud on the wrong account."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019, I attempted to do a balance transfer on this card with another bank. I called to customer service to verify the balance at that time, XX/XX/XXXX. They gave me an amount and the total went up XXXX dollars throughout the process, with no explanation or notice. It wasn't mentioned during my XX/XX/XXXX phone call. I had to cancel the initial payment from my bank, XXXX XXXX and initiate a new payment with the suddenly increased, undisclosed amount. I understand from a phone call today that Synchrony Care Credit has held onto this check since XX/XX/XXXX, not applying it to my account in an attempt to collect more interest I suspect. XXXX XXXX sent them a check for the increased amount on XX/XX/XXXX. The call center agents are hostile and unprofessional and completely irrational. I asked for a supervisor and XXXX came on the phone and was attempting to impersonate a supervisor by repeating he was an "" account manager "" and refusing to confirm whether or not he was a supervisor. When I figured out that he was lying, I asked for a supervisor. He claimed "" none were available '' he was "" very sorry. '' Kept repeating that, like a recording. I asked for my survey and he disconnected the call in a way that I was unable to take the survey, barring me from taking my phone survey. He attempted to pretend to be a supervisor after I asked for one. I was transferred to another call center 's "" buddy, '' which was this guy. The problem is that Synchrony has my check, charged me interest during a balance transfer process and is attempting to charge me further interest to go into another additional billing cycle."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/XXXX I had a XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital. I paid {$100.00} toward procedure on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I didn't receive any bills until XX/XX/XXXX. I had so many bills I could not keep straight because every department in the hospital bills seperately. It took me almost 8 months to get EVERY bill! Horrible system. 

I paid : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$50.00} Called on XX/XX/XXXX to set up payment arrangement of {$110.00} PAID XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$110.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX {$120.00} XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX {$110.00} ( for XXXX payment - going on vacation paid early ) XXXX XXXX XXXX {$110.00} On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX XXXX because I was unable to make a payment through the system. They could not find my account. I was told someone would get back to me but they could not accept a payment without the account to match it up. 

Did not hear anything from them. On XX/XX/XXXX ( within a day or two of that date ) I called for update and they still could not find my account. I told them I had a payment arrangement what is going on. The girl said that she did not see an actual arrangement in the system but can see that my payment is always {$110.00}. She did not understand and said that there is nothing she can do without the account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made a general payment of {$200.00} that was accepted ( to make up for other months ). They accepted it so I thought maybe they found my file. The payment was taken ( never refunded ). I called billing the end of XXXX to get my account number to make the XXXX payment and the person that answered the phone this time told me that they had sent my account to collections. 

I was extremely upset and told them that I had been consistently making payments and had an arrangement that I never missed. She said she can see that they should not have sent me to collections but there is nothing they can do now that the file is gone. She could also not tell me who I should pay or where the bill went. She told me that a collection agency would contact me directly to make payments. 

I was never contacted until XXXX of XXXX for this bill. It took almost 6 months for this bill to resurface. I could easily have paid it off right away but since I had the payment arrangement I thought it was ok since I had so many medical bills I was on payment arrangements with for this procedure. 

I made arrangements with AWA Collections - after I researched this charge to make sure it was the hospital bill. They told me they would not be able to remove it if I paid it. They had me contact XXXX XXXX hospital to see if they would remove if I paid. XXXX XXXX told me they don't have any way to remove anything from credit after the file is gone it is up to collection agency. 

It is paid in full and never should have gone to collections. I have worked so hard to ensure that NO bills would go to collections and this happened to me even with a payment arrangement - as well as another bill from XXXX  - whom I did pay completely and decided to send me ANOTHER billing 6 months later with no contact to me. 

Please help me get this off my credit since it never should have gone to collections. I was making the payments and did all I could to pay and they would not accept payments from me - they have record of my calls. 

Thank you - XXXX XXXX XXXX"
Debt collection,I'm a single Father and i attempted to finance a home for me and my family and i could not because of my credit. That inspired me to check my credit report and I saw a lot of fraudulent items I did not authorize.
Vehicle loan or lease,"Two weeks ago I spoke with a collections representative from Ally financial in regards to a partial payment that came back returned. I advised that the payment was denied by my mother 's bank for suspicious activity. I was then told that as long as the partial payment of {$190.00} was paid my XX/XX/19 then the account would be in good standings. I advised that I would make my payment online on that day. Last week, I received another call from the collections department in regards to my loan. I repeated the same information to this representative that I stated to the last. Making them aware that I will keep my promise to pay by Monday XX/XX/2019. Again stating that the payment would be made online. Today I attempted to go online to make my payment only to find that my account information is no longer available and I am unable to make my payment as I had previously promised. I called in and spoke with 5 different representatives. The first two representatives hung up on me because they became frustrated and was unable to answer my questions. The 3rd representative transferred my over the online team which then transferred me back to customer service where I spoke to a 4th representative. Which then attempted to assist me and then the line was disconnected again. I called back and requested for a supervisor. I was then connected to a front line manager named XXXX ID # XXXX. I was told that I do not have access to the online and can't make payment for 6 months due the reverse payment. I attempted to make a payment via a 3rd party vendors which is a payment options that is available to me to make payment with a lower fee, however this option via XXXX and also via XXXX XXXX. Both are considered to be an acceptable payment option for this company. However, I have been blocked from making payment via the 3rd party vendors by Ally financial which they have on their website as payment options that can be done online or over the phone. The only option that I was given was the more expensive option of XXXX. XXXX and XXXX XXXX offer a fee of less than {$5.00} to submit a payment to Ally financial online. XXXX charges {$20.00} processing fee to send funds to Ally Auto. So currently I have not access to view my account details, statements, previous payments, nor do I have access to view my account in order to make the payment and ensure that it's applied to the correct account. I was told my XXXX that my account will be escalated and someone will get back with me in 24 hours. My account will be reported to the credit bureau tomorrow, which will cause a negative score on my credit as Ally Auto will report my account being passed due for 30 days due to this partial payment. This is unacceptable!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"This particular credit card company has an XXXX XXXX  cut off time for paying bills online. If you miss that time they charge you a {$25.00} late fee. Honestly I have missed this before, but I call the next day and they adjust it off. This time I was online getting ready to pay on XX/XX/2019 and it was a few minutes before XXXX XXXX. My internet went out and by the time I was back online it was a couple minutes after XXXX XXXX  XXXX to be exact. I clearly remember this because I thought there is no way they are going to charge me for being 2 minutes late. Wrong! I received my online statement today XX/XX/2019 and they did charge me {$25.00} late charge. 
I called today XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX and they will not adjust it off, they said I have no wavers? I am guessing you are only allowed one waver every so many months that is why I have not had problems in past. I asked to speak to supervisor and she basically told me the same thing even if one minute late they will charge you. I asked to dispute this charge and she said they dont do that, you cant dispute late charge. I asked to speak to someone else and was told there was no one else I could talk with there was no one above her. I said you must have a boss and she advised they only do administrative work, frustrated I said thanks and hung up After hanging up the more I thought about this I do not have this problem with anyone other company I pay. I believe this might be this companys way to get people to pay more money on late fees with the XXXX XXXX cutoff time. 
I receive an email, but a lot of times I dont even get to my personal email until XXXX or XXXX XXXX. This is exactly why I have had to ask for help in the past, because I open email after the cut off time. Not only the time but the date its the XXXX due date, all of my other bills are due at end of month. 
I believe they are taking advantage of me and I am sure other customers by having this special due date and time. Then when calling and asking for help all the sudden they dont want to help. I have been working very hard to clean up my credit history for the past year, and I just recently jumped up by thirty points, this late charge is going to affect my credit history that I have been working so hard to improve. I would like this late note removed from my account and a refund. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thank you for your consideration if I can provide further information please let me know Best regard"
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/19 I made a payment of {$800.00}. This was above the contractual payment amount but did not bring the loan current. The mortgage company was already holding XXXX which left roughly XXXX to bring the loan to a current status. On XX/XX/19 I was notified by XXXX that the payment had been cancelled by the recipient. I called the mortgage company about sending the payment back and was advised to send {$1800.00}. I told them it would be wired XX/XX/19. On XX/XX/19 I called to verify receipt and was told the loan was active in foreclosure, that it had been placed in foreclosure XX/XX/19. 
I asked why they didnt apply my contractual payment, per CFPB guidlines under RESPA and was told they didnt have to. They have since sent back the {$1800.00} and are still holding the XXXX, but are now charging me over {$7500.00} to avoid the foreclosure when my balance is XXXX with the XXXX payment"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, the request was made to apply for an auto loan with a specific lender with whom I've already had an established positive lending relationship, being XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

It had been made clear that a security freeze was in place on my credit for safety purposes and avoidance of abuse of process. 

In good faith, I temporarily lifted the credit-freeze for 24 hours with XXXX  for the dealers to contact the requested lender who approved the loan in the amount greater than what was requested. 

The dealers subsequently proceeded to create an additional 7 to 10 hard inquiries against my credit score by other lenders despite my choice lender already approving the loan for a greater amount than requested and without my knowledge or consent. Immediately following this action, the dealers demanded I unfreeze an additional credit profile with XXXX  where they posted additional hard inquiries against my score without reason. XXXX  was lifted for 24 hours at my request, however, upon leaving the dealership without my vehicle, I discovered that the XXXX  freeze had been held open against my request of 24 hours by the dealers who were intending additional postings against my score unnecessarily. 

The dealers refuse to release the vehicle me under the disclaimer of insurance until the hard inquiries had in fact been declared as posted to my account greatly reducing my score. 

The following action was not only unnecessary but heinous."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have disputed the inaccurate unverified accounts on the three major credit reporting companies ( XXXX, XXXX, Trans-Union ) XXXX deleted the accounts, but XXXX and Trans-Union are still reporting as verified.

Again XXXX has deemed the accounts as unverified and has deleted them as of ( XX/XX/XXXX ). How is XXXX and Trans-Union able to verify them?"
Checking or savings account,"I was sent a notice of inactive account on XX/XX/XXXX from Bank of America. I called the customer service number listed as instructed within 30 days of the date listed as instructed, but find that they've prematurely closed the account already. When I called the first time, the representative I spoke to told me that the funds ( {$5600.00} XXXX had already been sent to the state. When I called my state 's unclaimed property department, they said they had not received the funds yet and to call back in a month. I do so, and they say they've still not received it and to call the bank again. 

I call Bank of America at this point and the representative asks me to send him a copy of the inactive account letter and to call back in two days. I call back, and they have no record of the call. I end up getting busy with work for the next few months and don't have time to follow up. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I call and am assured that they will be sending out a check and should receive it in 6-8 weeks. I get a reference number.

Another two months go by and I've yet to receive anything. On XX/XX/XXXX, I call again and the representative seems shocked that I've been dealing with this for over a year and gets the issue escalated, and assures me that I should receive a check in 1-2 weeks. 

Almost a month goes by, and nothing. Today is XX/XX/XXXX, and I call again. The representative says I should give it 6-8 weeks, without any confirmation of whether this check has actually been sent, or if it's even been sent to the correct address. 

I've spent countless hours calling and dealing with this for over a year, not to mention the possible loss in investment value."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Last year my bank erroneously gave access to my accounts to an unknown party. I have activated fraud alerts and freezes at all 3 credit reporting agencies. Trying to have the fraud alert removed by Experian has become a trial of patience that they are winning. I have been hung up on, told to upload documents to a site that will not accept documents, have been in the endless loop of computer phone calls that end in a computer telling me they can't help me to being transferred to voicemail accounts. I finally talked to someone that said it will take 3 days for the removal - so much for getting electricity today .... 

These companies have such control over our lives and are adding more and more every day, like insurance - auto, homeowners and health now use your credit score for rate determination. I have spent 3 hours talking to numerous foreign countries today with zero results. Be wary about putting any alerts on your credit record."
Student loan,"I was struggling to make payments with Navient, and getting bombarded with phone calls saying that a payment wasn't made. I would say a payment was made on this day and they would say sorry give a 24-48 hours to show up for us, this would happen a couple times a week. I would go online and see fees and have no idea where they came from, my account would show not current while payments were being made. While I would get these calls telling them a payment was in fact made, I would say this is really hard, I need my payments lowered. I was told by a representative that they didn't want to insult me on how to make my payments. I couldn't take the phone calls, or the struggle, or just the rudeness of the employees anymore so I missed a couple payments. In XXXX, I was told that no one worked hard enough to lower my payments and infect my interest rate could have been lowered. I was distraught because this has been a struggle, I had a baby 10 months ago so I had this added expense as well. I was asking for a contract saying that this is what my payments would be if in fact my interest rate could be lowered and was told they can only do this verbally and also if my debit card was on file. After everything I did not want to have an automatic payment from this company. I have been trying to get an attorney to help me deal with them and I can not find one that is willing to take me on, one in my budget that is or deal with this company. Two attorneys said that they do not deal with Navient. I just want to pay back my loans without being insulted or depriving my daughter of things that she needs and being able to pay my other bills."
Mortgage,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the mortgage company ( Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC ) regarding my bill because of a late fee  charge and Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC told me that I did not pay the full amount. Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC received {$1700.00} in XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX mortgage payment. I asked Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC if they can apply the amount that I paid to them to my Principal and Interest but they declined, stating that I did not make the full payment. Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC informed me that there was a {$610.00} shortage in my escrow. We could not complete the phone conversation because the phone got disconnected. I called back the next day and told XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that I would send a check for the escrow shortage and the escrow shortage was received on XX/XX/XXXX. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to verify why my XXXX was still not applied. Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC informed me that they did not get the  complete payment of {$1700.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a check of {$500.00} to the escrow account so that it would reduce my monthly payment. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to verify that Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC received {$500.00}. Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC indicated they received the check but it is still pending. I explained to Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC that I would like my monthly payment to be reduced since I sent an additional {$500.00} to the escrow, but Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC said that it is not possible to apply that to reduce my monthly payment, because according to Federal Law, I am unable to add any more money to my escrow account. I asked Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC to take the balance from the {$500.00} to complete XXXX payment, which is {$250.00}, and refund {$250.00} back to me. They indicated that in order to do that, I have to submit my bank statement to show proof that the money was cleared from my bank. On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed both my bank statement showing the {$500.00} and a copy of the check for {$500.00} that was paid to Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC. I received an automated email response with a ticket number stating that my request has been forwarded to the appropriate department and to use that ticket number for further communication regarding my request. I have called Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC twice today, XXXX, XXXX XXXX. First at XXXX then at XXXX, and I received an automated message of their unavailability. However, Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC 's normal business hours on a weekday is  XXXX. It appears that Lakeview Loan Servicing LLC is  avoiding my calls. The reason I am contacting you is that I have been trying to fix my mortgage account but I am getting the run around and it is getting very frustrating."

For instance there are 4 or 5 pertaining to my buying a house. I was told that there was a grace period where the hard inquiries would be waved.

I was actually told that my wife and I could shop for mortgage lenders without penalty. Being that this was our first time ever buying a home, we feel like we were taken advantage of. Both of our credit reports reflect several inquiries that seem to resulted it lower our scores by what we consider a substantial amount. The following are reflected on both, my Equifax and XXXX  ; and I'm assuming my XXXX  as well : XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX- XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX- XX/XX/2018, XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX- XXXX .

I never gave Fairway permission to run my credit the way they did. They were given permission for a pre-approval and the did 2 hard inquiries. All of these inquiries are disheartening. I was told I would not be penalized while house shopping ; and, I was Also, I went to XXXX dealer ship in XXXX CT, on XX/XX/XXXX. I gave them permission to run my credit once, as a co-signer and they ran it themselves and through XXXX XXXX. Some of the inquiries on my credit report are nearly a year or so old.

Student loan,"In 2014 I went to Wells Fargo at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Texas with my mother to get a small student loan to cover the gap between my scholarship and my government aid. During the Loan application process the Wells Fargo associate told my mother and I that my loan would not accrue interest while I was in school, much like the federal subsidized loan I had just taken out. My mother has also confirmed that this associate explicitly told me that the contract I was signing meant that my loan would not accrue interest while I was in school. I was XXXX years old so I did not understand the terminology and signed the papers at the assurance of the associate. 

Five years later, I am looking at my Wells Fargo documents to check where I am with my loans in total, so I can anticipate the amount I need to payback upon graduation from law school. I notice that I have accrued almost double the amount of the loan in interest since it was signed in XXXX ( at an interest rate of almost 12 %, which absolutely should have been lowered as my credit score raised ) The Wells Fargo App only ever shows the principle interest and I had been led to believe that it was not accruing interest by the Wells Fargo associate so it was something I pushed to the back of my mind. There was no reason for me to believe that the loan was accruing interest between what the associate had assured me off as well as the principle balance being the only balance reflected on the Wells Fargo portal. 

I contacted Wells Fargo and they set me up with a customer service representative, Ms. XXXX XXXX at XXXX extension XXXX and she did nothing to help my situation. She reported back to me that the manager at the bank had "" no records '' of my student loan which is incredibly suspicious seeing as how Wells Fargo has had a problem as of the last few years of predatory loan practices. I told her that I was misled and lied to but she insisted it was my fault and I was informed because I signed the documents, again, I was XXXX years old and didn't know what 'interest ' really even meant. So I believed whatever the Wells Fargo Associate told me. 

I am not a XXXX  person ... I have a credit score of over 750 and I am in law school -- what Wells Fargo did to me is wrong and I am worried for all of the other XXXX year olds out there who are being misled and LIED to by Wells Fargo in order to get them to sign loans and pile on the interest payments. 

Wells Fargo has told me there is 'nothing they can do about my situation ' but I know that that is also a lie. They are engaging in predatory behavior toward young and uninformed borrowers, and when I asked them to find out why this person misled me they returned with "" we have no records. '' I am very concerned about these predatory loan tactics and I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Any case, civil or DISMISSED, no longer exists in the eye of the law and a case filed that was never and has NEVER been actually adjudicated. Therefore you have no right to maintain information that the government has deemed legally nonexistent. 

Therefore pursuant to Section 1681 a ( 5 ) of the FCRA you must DELETE this information from my credit report and send me an updated copy when this action is completed. 

Considering that this does not require an investigation, I would appreciate your answer within 14 calendar days."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/2018, Chase Mortgage took over my home loan from XXXX XXXX. I inadvertently continued to send my payments to XXXX XXXX and was not aware until XX/XX/XXXX that my payments were not being received by Chase Mortgage. Once I was made aware of this I began to work with my Bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX to try and track down my payments and get back in good standing with Chase. This process took some time and in the meantime Chase deemed me a risk and sold my mortgage to XXXX. This caused my credit score to  drop almost 200 points. I have always been good about paying my bills except for a few 'hiccups ' along the way. The major exception is the time period from XX/XX/2018, when Chase decided to buy my mortgage from XXXX XXXX, until XX/XX/2018 when I was made aware of the situation and took steps to correct this. As you can see from the attached documents I fixed the 'lapsed ' payments and have been on time since then. I feel that this situation was not caused by my inability to pay, but due to some confusion with the buying and transfer of my mortgage and therefore I should not be penalized by this.I would appreciate anything that can be done to help restore my credit to where it was before this all happened. Thank you for your consideration."

You may even choose to redeem your 20,000 points for {$200.00} cash back or use it for other great rewards! '' Does not state in offer any delay in having points credited to your account for redeeming the reward.

I did contact by phone UMB Bank and was told they did not have a rewards department or contact person and that any qualifying points that I was entitled to would be delayed from being added to my account after 90 days and one to two billing cycles of the card. This wasn't specified in the written promotional offer, making it impossible for any cardholder to be aware of the delay in receiving the bonus reward. 

I made numerous phone calls over a 2-day period ( XX/XX/2019 & XX/XX/2019 ) to have my reward points applied to the credit balance on my account only to be mistreated and given a vague response.

Student loan,"Navient is the current servicer of my consolidated federal student loans. I have had constant barriers to my ability to apply for and subsequently recertify my income based repayment plan. The current complaint deals with their admitted failure to contact me about recertifying my REPAYE plan in XXXX using the provided and up to date contact information. As a result, they have converted my IBR/IDR into a standard repayment plan and failed as well to notify me of such until a past due balance had accumulated. 

The navient website directs customers to the studentloans.gov site for loan information. The studentloans.gov site directs customers to the navient website for information. When I called to speak to navient about the issue, despite admitting to the notification oversight, the rep said that the only way to move forward is by applying for a forbearance and then reapplying for an IBR/IDR. He listed the conditions for the application which include impacting loan forgiveness for on time payments. I indicated that it was my understanding that by missing these erroneous payments and then going into forbearance it reset or potentially deleted the clock on the possiblility of forgiveness in the distant future. I was not ok with this option given their oversight. 

I was then told that my only other option was to pay them {$6000.00} and still apply for a new IBR/IDR. Given the unsatisfactory nature of either, I indicated that I was only accepting the forbearance under duress and that I wanted that fact noted on my account. This is not the first time that I have been placed in an almost identical situation by navient. It took so many months ( 4-6 months as I remember ) for them to get my initial application to me and then processed that I was also forced under duress to file for forbearance. 

I should stop being surprised every time, but I am also very unhappy about being told by my loan servicer that they dont actually do anything associated with repayment plan applications. Theyre happy to file a forced forbearance, however, each time I am instructed that the only way to obtain the application is by calling some third party system automated system that has no possible way of speaking to a live agent. It is my recollection that for my initial application it took 2-3 failed attempts from this system before I finally got ahold of the right person at navient that was authorized to actually service my loan. Last year I seem to remember that I was contacted in advance to recertify, but still faced difficulties with obtaining the necessary application and getting it processed. 

Navient has been explicitly informed during every phone call I have ever made to them as well as in writing with every piece of mail I have sent them that I do not accept any form of incoming electronic or telephone communications from them. All contact should be through USPS or other snail mail. This is to specifically combat the unreliability of telecommunications due to everything from changing spam filters to my financial ability to maintain internet or telephone service. Additionally, it helps me to combat the abusive and manipulative practices of companies like navient that like to hide pertinent and timely information in things like html emails that would not even be loaded in my email to begin with since security settings prevent it. ( Not to mention navient emails go directly to junk and will never be placed on a safe list because they should not be contacting me using that route anyways. ) I do not accept phone calls from numbers not known to me. If a message is not left, the number is immediately blocked. Any businesses that ever text my cell phone are immediately blocked. I have no idea if navient is included in this list because trash phone calls from unprofessional reps and robocallers are a ubiquitous problem that I handle by blocking. Even if I was willing to accept these trash phone calls, I dont hear well and do not like to use a telephone for this sort of business. 

Navient has been repeatedly informed and sometimes agreed, sometimes indicated that its not legal to do that, sometimes just said it doesnt matter theyll contact me however they like and its my problem if I dont get the information. Today, the rep agreed and once again noted on my account the correct method for contacting me. But he also took the stance that it doesnt matter if they contacted me or not, its my problem and not theirs that the repayment plan was changed. He did indicate that there was no way that filing a forbearance or being late on these erroneous payments would impact future eligibility for loan forgiveness programs. Based on my understanding, it seems that is likely a blatantly false statement, but I will have to reread all of the terms of my loans and repayment plans to verify. 

This behavior is unprofessional. It is unacceptable. It has now met the definitions of chronic and habitual. This sort of abuse of students borrowers on such a wide scale should not be allowed to continue. There is a very real risk that navients very shady practices in loan servicing will result in my loans defaulting. I live in fear that an already dismal amount of debt will create such incredible and undue hardship for the rest of my life that I may never be able to recover. 

It is time for navient to start honoring their responsibilities to the USDOE and the students with the misfortune of having their loans serviced by navient."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a XXXX pre-paid MC Debit Card from the Gift Card Rack at XXXX XXXX for {$300.00}. I had some Cash that I wanted to use for a purchase online and since I already had a XXXX Acct I thought this was a valid option. The only real information visible on the packaging was that it was not a gift card. I was aware of that, however I thought it would work like a reward debit card for which I have had several and found them easy an convenient to use. It was not until I tried to activate the card that I realized that something was not right. Initially I explained that I purchased the card for a one time transaction and that I assumed the card was active until the balance was used. The answer I received was 'yes you can do that ' Turns this card had an expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. Then I went through a lengthy credit interview and realize that this was a not what I thought it was. Because I had already purchase the card I felt I had not other option so I activated the card. Next I went the use the card and was unsuccessful. I conducted the transaction on XXXX where I now have an active Debit & Credit card to make purchases. The purchase I was making was {$340.00}, I wanted to use the entire {$300.00} balance on the Debit and charge the remaining balance {$40.00} to my credit card. That transaction failed, when I call XXXX support that's when I found out that the XXXX Debit card was not actually XXXX and that they could not help me. I ended up applying the entire purchase on my credit card. So over the last month or so I have used up the balance on the debit card on smaller transactions and have keep track of the balance. On the last purchase attempt the transaction failed because I was overdrawn. When I called them I was told that I was over drawn and had a - {$2.00} balance and that include the $ XXXX monthly service fee. When I told them that this is not how I thought this would work and that I acquired this card for a onetime purchase they said they would cancel the account. I said yes and the agent said ' one minute ' when she can back she said she took care of it. Then I said now I would like to pay off the {$2.00} balance she said I could not because she had already cancelled the account. So I never did use the entire balance on the card ( {$1.00} remaining ) The next day I received new XXXX prepaid Debit card in the mail with my actual name on it and a new account number and a new expiration of XX/XX/XXXX. I did not ask for this card and I have not activated it. 

Lastly I was not aware that this was a netspend acct. until I fill out the complaint. It was not mention in any of the documentation I have from them."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2019 I was scammed by someone who claimed to work for XXXX and this man who supposedly worked at XXXX informed me that my XXXX account and my computer had been hacked. He asked me to pull up the command prompt and told me to look at the foreign addresses which I did and their was 7 different foreign addresses so he told me that meant I had 7 hackers so he had me purchase these gift cards because he told me it would get rid of the hackers and trick them and protect my identity and this was all a free charge from XXXX and that any money used to purchase the gift cards would be refunded to my bank account within 5 minutes. I gave my mother my bank card and she went into XXXX to get these cards so that I could stay in the car with my XXXX year old son so {$4000.00} of my money was scammed away in a matter of minutes. I called my bank right away to file a dispute because I quickly realized the guy claiming to work for XXXX was the actual hacker. The phone number of the guy who supposedly worked for XXXX support is ( XXXX ) XXXX and referred to his name as XXXX XXXX and either states he works for XXXX support but I also found out he claims to work for XXXX support as well. I filed a police report with XXXX XXXX and report number XXXX. I also closed my old bank account and opened a new one just as my bank Huntington Bank advised me to do. I also called XXXX and informed them of everything and gave them all of the gift cards purchased with all of the information on them that was given to the scammer. XXXX gave me a case number which is XXXX. I did everything Huntington advised me to do and asked me to do. I gave them all of the information I could and filed a dispute minutes after I realized what happened. I have banked with Huntington for 10 years so they should know that was completely out if character for me and the bank was not there to protect me at all. They never called me while this was going on or even attempted to stop the transactions like I've learned that other banks do. The bank sent a letter with their decision a week after the incident happened and that's with the holidays in the mix. I don't feel like they did a thorough investigation nor do I feel like they had or have my back in all of this. I also told Huntington that XXXX was aware that someone hacked into my XXXX account and that they froze my account for awhile. I have emails from XXXX that prove this and Huntington never even asked to see those or tried to work with me amd gain further documentation or information. I was scammed out of XXXX XXXX dollars and I shouldn't just have to eat it. Huntington should have my back. All Huntington would have to do is call this guy and play into his scam and see  exactly how I was scammed and that it was indeed a scam. I will be choosing another bank to bank with because if I am entrusting a bank with my money then I would them to have my back and Huntington certainly does not have my back. The transactions I disputed was for {$600.00}, {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, and {$400.00} again I disputed this within minutes of this all happening."

She played upon my son 's health issues and assured me that by providing ten people 's contact information I would not owe anything for the machine. I was leery of the purchase because of the extremely high interest rate and the predatory nature of the whole pitch, but she would not leave until I purchased from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Systems. 
When I did not make payments I reached out the sales person ( the only contact number I had ) and she did not return my calls. I could not locate anyone to speak to and they never reached out to me despite my phone number not changing since 2005. 
When I attempted to buy a home this Preferred Credit showed up as a negative account on my credit report. I had no clue who that was so I disputed it, but the reporting agencies told me to deal directly with Preferred Credit. After two weeks of constant back and forth and arguing I finally paid a settlement amount just to be able to move on with my life.

Debt collection,"I keep getting calls from XXXX XXXX of Credit Collection Bureau, repeatedly calling up to 3+ in a row daily. I have received a letter in mail from XXXX on XX/XX/19 with a copy of old invoice that clearly states {$0.00} balance owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA. The balance was paid several months ago directly to XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

It should never have been given to any collections agency. Even a monkey could tell that the invoice they mailed reads {$0.00} balance. It is verifiable with a bank statement and directly can be confirmed with XXXX XXXX XXXX. The medical facility was paid in allocated time allowed before any debtor is notified. 

XXXX XXXX of Credit Collection Bureau is inflicting harassment with malicious intent. I have answered a call without speaking and she starts talking to me as if she knows me personally.

Mortgage,"XXXX XX/XX/XXXX I called USAA/XXXX to ask why there were so many "" payment reversals '' on my account and why the XX/XX/XXXX payment posted, was reversed and re-posted for a different amount ( higher interest and lower principal ). Came back to the account on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and USAAXXXX had moved a monthly payment ( amount $ XXXX principal XXXX interest XXXX escrow ) and moved an additional principal payment ( amount {$170.00} ) from the date XX/XX/XXXX into an escrow payment. 
I have been trying since that date to get this reversed. I was told that this was done at my request. I do not think that I requested this. It does not make sense to me to move money from principal to escrow years later. The mortgage company will not allow me to hear a recording or see a transcript of the call without a subpoena ordering access to such. Further, I am told, if I present a subpoena for this, it is considered that I am being represented by a lawyer and the mortgage company will only speak to that lawyer about my mortgage and not to me directly. I am told that is not a written policy that I was presented before I entered in to my mortgage with them and it is not in any of the forms I signed at my closing, but it is "" more of a policy '' of XXXX/Nationstar ''. 
USAA does not claim any responsibility for XXXX 's actions, except they claim to have reviewed the phone call and verify that I asked for this money to be transferred. This person 's name is XXXX XXXX. He and I spoke on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and he was going to reverse the {$1100.00}. 
Other people that I spoke to at USAA or XXXX : XXXX : first person I had contact with moved the money initially and told me he would move it back. Never made contact with me again. 
XXXX : spoke to her on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : spoke to him on XX/XX/XXXX, told me he initiated the reversal and would take 3-5 business days. He set a call back for me, left me a voice mail. I called back because the transaction was not completed. He then told me it would be done in 24 hours. Was not completed. 
XXXX : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX promised it would be fixed 2-3 business days. Called XXXX XX/XX/XXXX was promised 2-3 business days. 
XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX was told "" there is no law '' stipulating this has to be fixed in any time frame. His "" manager '' XXXX XXXX told him it will be done "" next week '' guaranteed. 
This still isn't fixed. 
I did not know that payments from 2 calendar years ago could be moved into the escrow account. I do not know how much clearer I can make it that I do not want payments from XXXX moved into the XXXX escrow account. I do not know how much longer I should be expected to wait for this to be corrected. I do not know how much longer is considered reasonable. I do not know if USAA/Nationstar is being truthful. I have recorded most of our conversations after learning of their "" subpoena '' deal.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I received an updated credit score through XXXX XXXX, which showed that my Transunion score had dropped 68 points. My score went from a XXXX to a XXXX the day after my bank reported our home refinance. I called the company to ask if that is a normal drop for a home refinance, since that big a drop seems like it would be a deterrent. I called the XXXX number provided by TransUnion on their website. I pressed zero to speak to a customer service representative. I explained my problem and they told me that my score is calculated by a formula that is automatic based on the information in my records. I asked if a 60 point drop is normal as that didn't sound right. I was told the same information, that my score is calculated by a formula that is automatic based on the information in my records. I asked if I could speak to someone who knew the formula and if that sum ( 60 points ) seemed correct. I was then told that nobody knows how it's calculated, it's automatic. I've worked hard to build my credit back up and this drop is disturbing and unnerving. The fact that nobody knows how this is calculated makes me feel like this is an arbitrary number that many important financial decisions are based on. I would like to know the formula, or know that the calculations are correct, and also the standard drop for a refinance. If this information is in error, it is detrimental and slanderous to my financial reputation. Thank you."

Why would I trust sending you identity verification & a written request that has security info on it to you via mail? As a company, you already had security issues but are now requesting that a consumer must provide a paper request with verification? 
How long does it take for a company to fix security issues? I feel that this company should be eliminated from the free XXXX XXXX XXXX  program. The other two, XXXX and XXXX   are providing reports via the internet without issues. 
Equifax does not deserve to remain a qualified credit reporting company and certainly does not qualify to work with any government mandated requirements."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I had put in a letter here about how there was 2 fraud hard inquiries that were not authorized by me made on XX/XX/2019 for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I got a letter back saying some ip address I am unaware of. This ip address was used on both applications. I have made several attempts speaking to XXXX XXXX and XXXX just keep getting the run around. It's been over 30 days and I feel that under the fair credit act this should be reversed since I have no idea with all due respect how this happened and clearly was not made by me. In the letter it stated there was attempts to call me but I never got any said calls. If someone can please finally help me with this nightmare.
Credit card or prepaid card,"This is the 10th Credit Card of American Express Card I am writing about because all these people have all forms of American Express Cards using my "" MULTIPLE ADDRESSES '' and these CEOs let them. I am unsure which addresses these people cunningly re-direct my mail to for so many years. This applies all the American Express Cards. CEOs of the American Express card company refused to close all accounts that links to my name and Social Security Numbers since year XXXX. I can prove it, please see attached. For the last 8-9 years, my sibblings and their friends ILLEGALLY use my Social Security numbers to commit Credit Card Frauds especially American Express cards and Mail Thefts. They refused to pay the bills and insisted on saying the Credit Cards are not under their name. I found out from the court house that American Express card company did tried to sue me however I did NOT receive any subpoenas because my sibblings and their friends committed Mail Thefts and Mail Frauds. I do NOT know who impostered me that day in court. But the case was Dismissed without prejudice. And from what I heard from my sibblings, an ILLEGAL deal was made to put me in debts that don't belong to me and to put my Elderly parents in debts as well. CEOs of the American Express card company "" created, printed out and ILLEGALLY distribute physical American Express Credit Cards in suspicious NUMEROUS AMOUNTS for 2 specific companies to pay for their daily breakfast, dinners in XXXX XXXX, CA etc. These people SCHEMED to expect me to be responsible for their bills especially when they FALSIFIED me to be a "" Philanthropist '' and even continues when they put me XXXX in year XXXX. I have lived in several XXXX XXXX  using their assigned IDs and experienced ALOT. I am NOT XXXX nor live in XXXX anymore. But that does NOT give any CEOs nor anyone especially my sibblings, their friends and specific companies to use me nor put me in debts out of SCHEMING, BELITTLEMENTS and BULLYINGS. My parents and I do NOT qualify to have any American Express card applications to be approved for the last 5 years. CEOs of American Express Card company and all these people took advantage of me and my parents for so many years. I have attached proofs that my application was declined. My Elderly XXXX XXXX XXXX father who has XXXX XXXX and urinates in XXXX XXXX XXXX and already moved from a 2 bedroom apartment to a single room with his wife has Identity Theft problems for 22-23 years without knowing and did NOT know his credit score do NOT qualify to have any Credit Cards especially American Express card application to be approved. Personally these CEOs needs to be investigated for such BULLYING and BELITTLEMENTS for the last 8 years. They ruined our lives!!!!! I need American Express card company to CLOSE all accounts that link to the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS of my parents and I PERMANENTLY and FLAG our names, POSSIBLE ALIAS NAMES these people have been using and information from being used by American Express card company PERMANENTLY. I am a VERY HEALTHY person since the beginning and I did NOT give anyone permission to use me NOR my parents for so many years!!!!! WE ARE NOT PHILANTHROPISTS AT ALL. Because of years of Bullying and BELITTLEMENTS and allowing all these people to Bully and to Belittle my parents and I by putting us in OBSCENE DEBTS, I need the CEOs and the American Express card company to send me all the statements in details of the last 8 years or so that link to my Social Security Numbers and my parents ' SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS WITHOUT the CEOs of the American Express card company acting SLICK and SHADY by giving what I requested to my sister nor to her XXXX XXXX who falsified on ILLEGAL contracts nor to this XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX nor to XXXX XXXX who both imposter me for years who FALSIFIED permission. And I want all the American Express card company debts that linked to my ELDERLY parents ' and my SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS to show up in our CREDIT REPORTS in details for the last 8 years or more even if the debts got balanced transferred or closed as DOCUMENTATIONS. I need to know "" where and who '' the debts got transfer to so I can CONFRONT them in courts Individually. I know I did NOT meet any American Express card CEOs in my entire life NOR did I ever anger them. This BULLYING, BELITTLEMENTS and SCHEMING needs to end PERMANENTLY with financial compensations DIRECTLY to my parents and I. I would hope XXXX will punish all BULLIES"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am requesting debt validation for a {$41000.00} charge off that is currently reported by Ditech to my credit report ( XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) and associated with my property XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX. I am also requesting that Ditech immediately discontinue attempts to update my credit report with the incorrect address XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX and remove my ex-wife, XXXX XXXX, as a joint owner of this debt ( account XXXX ). Ditech is incorrectly reporting my ex-wife, XXXX XXXX, as a joint owner on this debt which is causing her information to erroneously appear on my XXXX/XXXX/XXXX credit reports. I have disputed this address numerous times with Ditech directly due to an identity theft case that has been reported and filed with the XXXX of XXXX, CA police ( attached ). I have also disputed this with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX but have failed to prevent Ditech from continuing to report the XXXX address, causing mail with personally identifying information ( Social Security Number ) to be directed to this address in error. 

Ditech has stated that they are the current owner of the {$41000.00} debt for account XXXX, purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX is the former lien holder/mortgage servicer of the 1st and 2nd mortgage to my property XXXX XXXX XXXX Place, XXXX XXXX, CO XXXX and is the only lien holder on record for this property. XXXX XXXX XXXX is a defunct unit of XXXX that forced many subprime loans to go into default, including the defaulted 2nd mortgage in question that has been purchased and reported to the ( 3 ) Credit Reporting Bureaus by Ditech ( formerly Green Tree ). XXXX successfully removed my ex-wife XXXX XXXX from her financial and legal obligation to repay either loan but failed to provide Ditech any documentation of the removal following the sale to Ditech on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX has never reported the 2nd mortgage to my credit report nor my ex-wife 's credit report until the sale of the defaulted 2nd mortgage to Ditech on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Ditech began reporting to the credit bureaus against XXXX and I both in XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX is not on the title and 1st mortgage of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In fact, we have been divorced since XXXX and have not lived in the property together since XXXX. The reason the home went into default was because my ex-wife 's parents had a lease-to-own contract for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and failed to pay the 2nd mortgage with XXXX per agreement. The contracted ended and I moved back into the property in XXXX XXXX. XXXX refused to let me do a loan modification and hardship to cure the deficiency on the 2nd mortgage as they stated I needed to be in default prior to approval of the loan modification. My last payment with XXXX was XXXX XXXX when I applied for the loan modification. I called to find out my status, which was declined, but never received anything in writing stating my ability to appeal the rejection within 30 days. I contacted XXXX numerous times to have the letters resent as they were never received as XXXX confirmed over the phone. The loan was forced into default.I never received any letters of acceleration, missed payment, or default from XXXX. I never received anything in the mail regarding the sale of my 2nd mortgage to Ditech until Ditech sent its first notice in XXXX to a MA   address I was renting at. 

XXXX 's mortgage center in XXXX, FL was contacted on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX regarding the loan serviced by Ditech. On XXXX XXXX, an agent for XXXX stated that notification letters regarding the rejected loan modification application, default and accelerated payment due to the default were mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The agent proceeded to say that I was given "" plenty of opportunity to work with XXXX on curing the deficiency '' because I had been granted a loan modification which allowed me to do so. This is false because a loan modification would require that I receive the necessary tax documents ( 1099 or 1098 form ) to file with the IRS for the XXXX tax year. On XXXX XXXX, the next agent I spoke with at XXXX regarding the loan could not see the loan modification documents or any documents related to the 2nd mortgage serviced by Ditech. The agent stated that Ditech is the owner of the defaulted 2nd mortgage purchased on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and that the letters I never received from XXXX regarding the default, declined loan modification, and acceleration were sent back to XXXX "" Return to sender : not deliverable '' despite the address being correct ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Colorado XXXX ). The agent stated that Ditech purchased the loan and would have all the documents necessary to correct the credit reporting that Ditech is providing to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX against my credit report as well as my ex-wifes, XXXX XXXX. She recommended I follow up with Ditech as they would have all the documents to make my dispute. 

XXXXs negligence has caused irreversible damage to my credit report in their failure to provide Ditech with the appropriate documentation necessary for accurate credit reporting. As of XXXX XXXX, Ditech stated the only documentation they possess regarding XXXX is a loan application with my ex-wife XXXX XXXX name on it. A loan application is not enough to prove valid ownership of a loan. Ditech is unable to provide me with the documentation that would support XXXXs claims and provide me a resolution to correct the credit reporting against myself and my ex-wife XXXX XXXX. 

Ditechs inability to validate the debt due to lack of documentation destroys the property value of my home as XXXX can not remove a lien on a property that XXXX does not own. I can not sell or refinance my property as this issue clouds the clear title I would have to guarantee a new mortgagor or buyer of the property. Mail is being incorrectly forwarded to an address containing my social security number, which further compromises my financial integrity as a victim of identity theft. 

I demand that Ditech remove the debt from mine and XXXX XXXX credit reports entirely or remove XXXX so that my identity is no longer compromised by reporting the incorrect address."
Debt collection,"The debt collection company CBE Group has been attempting to collect on a debt that is not owed by me. While I have received proof that the debt is real, it was opened by another individual with the same first, middle and last name as myself and I am in no way responsible for this debt. I have made the CBE Group aware of this via multiple letters, the most recent on XX/XX/XXXX, and they have refused to provide any evidence that it was myself, and not this other individual, who opened the account yet continue to claim I owe this debt. I have only received copies of XXXX billing statements listing the other individual 's name and home address, with continued demands that I pay."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/19 TransUnion dropped my Credit Score "" Fico Score 8 '' from XXXX to XXXX a staggering 41 points. I called TransUnion, they stated my XXXX XXXX XXXX ( Master Card from XXXX ) did not reported a balance for this period. I filed a complaint with TransUnion and after a while I received a letter with the results of a reported balance of {$300.00}. Right after this they dropped my score another 6 points - a total of 47 points from XXXX to XXXX and I accuse they doing it out of retaliation! For the entire year I had scores from all 3 major Credit reporting agencies at XXXX and above! Never paid late, not one hard inquiry and the average credit use is 2-3 %. The other 2 agencies still kept my score at around XXXX - right now XXXX. This credit rating unjustified and completely out of line compared to the other ratings. This is damaging my credit status!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"Three issues : 1. Online chat showed conversations of MANY other customers ' conversations. The messages clearly demonstrate that other customers are seeing threads that do NOT belong to them. This is a huge legal and compliance issue. 
2. Account is not activated when agent said it was. This is lie and deceit. 
2. Business card accounts can not be registered or managed online. This is a known issue without deadline for resolution. 

Details below : Opened a CitiBusiness AAdvantage Platinum XXXX card in XXXX. 

Two weeks later, finally received card in the mail. 
Same day, I try to activate it online. Keeps saying "" information is incorrect. '' A week later, I get text messages AND mail that there was fraudulent activity on my account. 
I call Citi Customer Service three times. Open online chat. 

Citi agent, on the third time, asks : Did you call a week ago? We suspect it's fraudulent call, and may need to close your account. 
After explaining that was me trying to activate the card, he said the card is not yet activated. 

I was then transferred to a rude agent, who was not trying to help at all. 
I have spent over an hour with a large Financial institution, and during this whole time, have not been able to use the card for a single transaction. 

After being transferred again, the Citi XXXX XXXX team tells me that it is a known issue that business customers can not register the card online nor manage it. There is no time for resolution."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was alerted by several different credit monitoring accounts I have that a hard inquiry had been made on my TransUnion report by XXXX on Sunday, XX/XX/2019. 

This wasn't my inquiry and I called XXXX on Monday. I took them a while on the phone, but they were able to locate an approved loan application with my social security number and name. 

The woman on the phone remarked to me that the application had the wrong birthday and address. I then had to go through an arduous and time-consuming process of getting a police report and submitting it to Prosper for them to remove the inquiry. 

I only did this because I wanted it taken care of, but how can this company make a hard inquiry on my account with incorrect vital information? 

I'd like this complaint to go to whatever level it can, and hold this lending service responsible for doing a hard pull with incorrect information."

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I have visited XXXX XXXX  located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I expressed interest in joining the facility. The attendant at the front desk employee took my information and gave me small membership card to join. I selected the $ XXXXmonth fee package to use the facility. I was informed that this is a month to month membership and I can cancel anytime. The front desk also offered me a free training session on that day. After the free training session, the trainer offered me to purchase more training session. With the suggestion of the trainer, I agreed to purchase 4 sessions for {$130.00} on the same day XX/XX/XXXX. On the following month on XX/XX/XXXX, I saw another charge of {$130.00} in my credit card for another 4 more training sessions. In total, I have paid for 8 training sessions. While 1 paid training session remaining unused, I informed the assistant manager of the facility on XX/XX/XXXX that I will not be using the facility anymore. Even after informing the facility, their system kept billing me and kept adding training sessions that I did not ask for and never used. Surprisingly, I received numerous calls from a collection agency on the week of XX/XX/XXXX. When I spoke with the agency on XX/XX/XXXX, the agency told me I owe money XXXX XXXX. After learning about this, I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with the club Manager XXXX XXXX. While speaking with XXXX he informed me of a contract which I was uninformed of. After several requests, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX provided me a copy of that said contract which doesnt have my signature. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have also requested copy of my usage and billing history which I did not receive. 

XXXX XXXX did not provide me with a copy of that said contract before XX/XX/XXXX. 

Without providing me a valid contract, the company kept adding charges for services that I had never asked for and I had never used. 

Without contacting me directly, XXXX XXXX, shared my information with a third party collection agency. 

The collection agency threatened to report me to credit bureaus and damage my perfect credit history. 

XXXX XXXX owes me a refund for the 1 session that I couldnt use due to scheduling conflict with the trainer. 

XXXX XXXX and its 3rd party collection agency is demanding payment for something I had never asked for and I had never used. 


The facts : 1 ) I had not received these contract from XXXX XXXX  directly from the time time I had started using the facility and to the period I had stopped using the facility. 

2 ) the signatures on the papers are not my signatures.

3 ) these charges were recurring training fees charges which I had never asked for and never used?

4 ) Neither XXXX XXXX not the collection agency provided me usage history even after multiple requests. Even before I had notified the front desk that I will no longer use the facility, I was charged for sessions for which sessions were not provided due to schedule conflict with the trainer. XXXX actually owes me money for those sessions that was not provided. 

4 ) If I want take this matter to the court, which court will have jurisdictions over this matter? I think the state AGs Office regulates the fitness clubs. But in case of I demand a trial, which court should I go to? Would you represent me in this case? 


No one reviewed the terms and no such phone call. Also they didnt give me copy of a contract. After I received call from collection agency, I called the facility and I told them that I was not aware of any agreement. Then the club manager XXXX told me that XXXX XXXX sent me copy of contract at my email at XXXX. But my email is XXXX. So XXXX thought they gave me contract even though they were sending it to the wrong address. 


XXXX  Calls me and emails me saying that XXXX will turn over this account to collection agency. How can XXXX do it when In fact XXXX already turned this over to collection agency before? I became aware of this balance from the collection agency."
Checking or savings account,this is with PNC bank where I obtained a home equity first mortgage loan on my condo 4 years ago. One of the conditions of getting the rate was to have the  payments automatically deducted from a PNC checking account. They indicated to me verbal and on a written document that as long as the checking account is linked to this type of loan that I would not be charged fees on having a low balance. My payment is XXXX a month and every quarter I deposit about XXXX to cover 3 months payments. I have another account where I do my day to day checking so I only use this checking account for making payments to this mortgage. I recently received a bank statement that had a fee for a low balance. I never been late on a payment and never overdrafted this account. An employee at the bank informed me that the bank changed their policy on linked accounts. They should not do this to accounts that were previously established on the conditions of linking accounts for making payments.
Mortgage,"I reached out to PNC Mortgage on XX/XX/19 to inquire about my escrow statement, and I believe they are in violation of RESPA. RESPA states that PNC can not collect more than one sixth of my annual escrow amount to hold as a cushion. My taxes this year were {$7900.00} and my insurance was {$970.00} ( {$8900.00} total ). We will have {$2000.00} in escrow after the XX/XX/XXXX payment. Our escrow is increasing to $ XXXX/month and they have also told us we have to pay a shortage of {$960.00}. The total for the next 12 months with these figures is {$11000.00}. That is an overage of {$2900.00} when our escrow payment is now {$740.00} ( 4 times the monthly escrow amount ). 

I'd like to confirm this is, in fact, a RESPA violation, and what recourse we have.

Transfer was XX/XX/XXXX one month after closing. closing was XX/XX/XXXX. I did review the Notice of Servicing Transfer and I have logged in many calls to XXXX. Confusing because XXXX number is XXXX. I used to pay {$720.00}. They were late posting the initial money from closing. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX about payments and how to do them online. I paid XX/XX/XXXX. Back then I had questions about the escrow. This is when the amounts did NOT agree. Then, they said I was short, it THEY were over paying. I saw this reflected on monthly statement of XX/XX/XXXX ( statement date ) and ( payment due date ) of XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I got a statement from LOANCARE LLC with a new amount of {$690.00}. ( Everyones Mortgage goes down, so I thought nothing of it. I have heard of VA Relief Program and other reasons for decreases, even on a fixed rate, so I thought nothing of it. ) Until, LOANCARE decided to transfer me over to XXXX which started at total amount due : {$690.00}. And that is when from then on it seems they PASSED there buck onto to me. And on XX/XX/XXXX the amount changed again to {$710.00}. I am So fed up with all this.

I then called our home owners insurance agent and met with him in his office and I called Wells Fargo with the insurance agent present and after an hour and a half of talking with 2 different customer service agents, the customer service agent admitted that Wells Fargo knowingly continued to allow for the XXXX XXXX insurance amount even after we had switched our policy over to XXXX and now they are requiring us to make up the difference all at once now starting XX/XX/XXXXand that they only allowed for 6 months worth of property taxes instead of the entire year 's amount, which is why they are trying to convince us that our property taxes and home owners insurance has significantly increased. They are also telling us that they now require a minimum balance of {$760.00} in our escrow account at all times for which they did not notify us or disclose to us. Our insurance agent told them that this is not right to to do that to their clients and the service agent agreed with him that it is not right for Wells Fargo to do this.

Debt collection,"XXXX XXXX from Consumer Solutions Group has left me repeated voicemails and when I spoke with him during XX/XX/2019, he told me he was calling from the Garnishment Department. I was extremely alarmed at first and made payment arrangements under duress that I can not afford due to his statement. And before that, he made the statement that he would inform them that we couldnt come to an agreement ; Im still not sure who them is. I was trying to explain to him my situation and Im on the verge of bankruptcy, to which he replied that pay day loans cant be claimed in bankruptcy, which is false. I soon realized that he is not calling from a court of law. I admit that I became angry with him, yelled and hung up on him, because it irritates me to no end that he was lying to me. I told him the third time I spoke with him that I was speaking with an attorney. He also wouldnt give me the address of the debt collection company ( I asked more than once ), but finally gave me the website and told me to look it up and get the address from there and see that they are a legitimate company and told me to have my attorney to contact him. I have been considering bankruptcy for a while and in fact did visit with an attorney a while back and I qualify to file, but didnt have enough money for that attorney at the time. I decided to go forward with the bankruptcy and contact an attorney, which I still cant afford, but feel I have to, because of his comment about working in the garnishment Department and the threat I felt when he said it, because I can not afford a garnishment, which now has me worried, because are they suing me or not? Also, when I asked to be mailed confirmation of this debt ( I asked more than once ) he wouldnt do it and I still havent received anything in the mail."

Debt collection,"On XXXX/17 I received an alert that a new collection was placed on my account. I called Midwest Recovery Systems. I informed them I never applied for a payday loan and I never received written notification of this debt from them. The customer service representative was rude and informed me that they did not have to give me written notification of anything. I have never done business with Midwest Recovery Systems. I do not have a signed contract with Midwest Recovery Systems. I have a right to demand that Midwest Recovery Systems furnish the signed contract between them and myself. This business did not give me written notice of the debt before placing it on my credit report with all three bureaus. Also this company is not licensed in the state of Tennessee. I would like this unfounded and unvalidated debt removed form my credit report. Per Tennessee Code TFDCPA 62-20-101 ( short title ) and 105 thru 127, Tenn Law emphatically states that "" a collection service can not commence or conduct the business of collecting debts in Tenn without being so licensed and bonded as well as maintaining a "" location manager '' who in turn is required to be licensed and bonded. in the State of Tennessee.

I go into my loan and sure enough, it has in big red letters that it is "" PAST DUE ''. I had made a payment on XX/XX/19 for {$400.00} toward this loan and had no balance due this month, then suddenly they created a retroactive past due balance.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","At the beginning of XX/XX/2019 I pulled all three credit reports and found two issues on them that tanked my credit score. One account is not even mine, the other was paid off and closed years ago. I first disputed on-line with no success. They returned results that stated "" all information correct and verified with reporting company ''. I then did a little research on how to have errors removed from your credit report, as well as spoke to an attorney that advised me to send certified letters to both companies asking that the accounts be verified with proof of that verification. One company ( A collection Agency ) refused the letter, the other sent me a response that said they had verified the information with the credit bureaus and was not required to provide any proof to me other than they verified my identity on this credit card ON-LINE. So apparently crooks don't open accounts on-line???!!! 
So I filed WRITTEN disputes to all three Credit Bureaus, sent them all Certified Mail, and just received a response from XXXX  stating once again regarding the same account - "" Information verified with reporting agency '' and nothing more. That's it??? Of course the reporting agency is going to "" confirm '' that their information is correct, but don't they need to provide some sort of PROOF other than their word?!!!!! What more can I do as a consumer to have this addressed/investigated properly??? 
The other account that I am disputing flat out refused to accept the letter that I sent them certified. Now what? I've filed written dispute as well on this response, but have not gotten a response yet from any of the Credit Bureaus. 
I need assistance immediately in addressing XXXX and their investigation processes. Both these items need to be removed immediately as neither of them have provided any type of proof/verification of accounts."

I am sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies. 
If your offices are able to provide the proper documentation as requested in the following declaration, I will require 30 days to investigate this information and during such time all collection activity must cease and desist. Also, during this validation period, if any action is taken which could be considered detrimental to any of my credit reports, I will consult with legal counsel for suit.

After checking my statement the next month I see the payment that was made from the other party, a refund for the {$300.00} payment I made and a few charges for requesting a refund and making a payment over the phone of which none I requested or did. Apparently the {$300.00} payment I made was refunded to the person that did the other payment the day before and they payment for the full amount they did over the phone was declined. I called my credit card company they claimed that It all came from me, which it didnt. I didnt have that amount of money in my bank account nor do I ever pay my credit over the phone, so they opened a case, then after a few months denied it demeaning me responsible for the changes. I called again they opened it again, I received no answer. They said I should send a letter and my bank statement since they are saying it all came from my bank account so I did all of that, still no answer. I did it to show them that there was no charge for {$1000.00} and also no refund for {$300.00}. Im losing out on {$300.00} and a year worth of interests on those {$300.00}.

Debt collection,"In early XX/XX/2013 Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. contacted me several times, harassing me up to 12 times a day from different spoofed numbers of real people. On one occasion, a female representative advised me that they had filed a suit against me and the only way to stop them from suing me or coming to my job to serve me with a summons was to make a payment with her over the phone. I refused to provide her with my social security number fearing it was a scam but I asked her questions about the debt and to my surprise she was so angry with me that she gave the name of a creditor that I had not done business with in over 10 years. When I explained to her that Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. was breaking the law by filing a suit on that debt and that she disclosed the information regarding a debt without verifying who I was, the young woman simply cursed at me and hung up on me. Immediately after that interaction I wrote to them at their Virginia address and provided very clear instructions to cease and desist contacting me then, and never to contact me in the future regarding any debts purchased by their company. I outlined each of their unlawful business practices and requested that they blacklist my SSN and Name together to prevent any contact from their company on any debt ever, past present or future. About 20-25 days later, all of the mail stopped coming from them, all of the phone calls stopped, and I never received any acknowledgment of my request. Portfolio Recovery simply stopped the harassment. 

Today, I live in constant fear and anxiety from their current onslaught of harassment EVERY SINGLE DAY. They are reporting multiple accounts on my credit reports ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ) and I get on average, 6 to 8 BACK TO BACK phone calls from Portfolio. Sometimes they call me using their company phone number but the majority of phone calls they spoof from different area codes/cities/states all over America and I have to trace back to Portfolio Recovery. Their company calls me using every different kind of auto dialer and spoofed phone number they can generate ( using the phone numbers of real people, companies, government agencies, etc ), I have called the phone numbers back and there are real people whose cell phones and business phone numbers are being spoofed by Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. in order to mask the true business calling. Because they are calling me on my work cell phone, I dont always have the option to not answer the phone. Their representatives are horrifically rude, caustic and have reduced me to panic attacks at work. When I try to explain that I dont want to be contacted and tell them that Ive already written them several times and to stop contacting me ; the representatives tell me that they have no record of any one at their company speaking to me and that they dont have any information and cant help me unless I tell them my social security number. It is very clear that they are falsifying contact records because of the way that they violate Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). When they repeatedly call me, they get extremely agitated and demand my social security number ( which I have never provided on an inquiry call ). They have called my work provided mobile phone ( I dont have a personal phone ), day and night and when they dont get anywhere with me they hang up in my face or dial me back to back and leave long voicemails with them eating on the phone. Ive been cursed at, hung up on and then they dial me back to back to back as if it is a sport for them. I have SEVERAL VOICEMAILS from Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC. that their phone collection agents leave just to harass me. Most all of the voicemails range 30 to 45 seconds in length and consist of them breathing on the phone, eating on the phone, while I hear very clearly the other people in the background introducing themselves and saying the Portfolio Recovery collection company name to the other people that they are harassing for the day. I live in constant fear of this company and how they aggressively encourage, train and develop their collection agents to yell at and intimidate me. They have made it impossible to for me to live a normal life out of the constant fear and verbal assaults from their call centers. When I returned their monthly attack of postal mail from my home in Virginia with attachments advising them to cease and desist contact on any accounts past, present or any debts that they purchase in the future ; they amped up their phone campaign and then started to contact my family by postal mail. They have begun to send harassing letters to my father ( by the same name but lives over 2000 miles away ), and my parents have returned mail to Portfolio Recovery Associates LLC every single month but continue to get harassing letters even after explaining that Portfolio is going after the wrong person. I wrote Portfolio again about two months ago and I made it very clear in my complaint that they were disclosing my debts to other people and that I was requesting for them cease all communication on any accounts held currently and prohibit future contact on any future accounts. I also explained in that letter that I was filing for bankruptcy and when I have everything put together, that I would have whatever attorney I choose to work with, send them a copy of the filing by mail. Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC has made a conscious decision to ignore my REPEATED requests for no contact and violate the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) by continuing to harass me and disclose the debt to 3rd parties after they have received notices from me on several occasions by mail and by phone. Im requesting escalation of my complaint to the FTC. I am confident that a review by the FTC will show that Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC has been dishonest and continues to break the law. After consulting with a legal advocate attorney who is handling other complaints against Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC, I intend to seek all options including any compensation available to me in every instance of violation based on the evidence ( extensive phone records, voicemails, and postal mailings ) I have accrued that documents in full detail their illegal use of telecommunications, continued aggressive harassment, their collection agents verbal abuse and coercion against me, disclosure of the debts to 3rd parties, forceful intimidation, falsification of communication records and failure to abide by repeated cease and desist requests for no contact on any debts owned past, present, or purchased in the future by them."

Debt collection,"XX/XX/2019 A debt collector/ Lawyer 's office started to call my place of employment months ago but more so in one week recently. The unidentified caller demanded payment and my personal financial information that very minute or else I will be sued as threatened in the past. I kindly asked for the calls to stop as I have before. That same week the same nameless person ( who refused to give me a name ) once again threatened of a lawsuit and stated I would be embarrassed at work for wage garnishments. Last call was a woman laughing and stating I will be in court and hung up .My place of employment has caller ID and all revealed the name of the same company and phone number. Clearly, this company does not honor the FDCPA rights. In addition, the main lawyer of this company has been in and out of practice due to violations of the California state bar. Now my lawyer needs to take action against this company."

Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed several pending charges on my Discover card account. I immediately called Discover to report these as a fraud. Discover says these charges were made by my youngest son and that I authorized him to be a user on the card in XX/XX/XXXX. I dispute that narrative. They claim this authorization was made via a XX/XX/XXXX phone conversation with Discover customer service. Discover 's  fraud investigation admits they have not listened to the recording of this conversation but is holding me responsible for these charges citing that I said I don't recall ever adding my son to my card as reason enough to make me pay for them. Further, they refuse to listen to for themselves or share the recording with me. They are demanding I file criminal charges against my son or pay for the fraudulent transactions. 

I had to pay an attorney to subpoena the recording from Discover but to date, they have not produced the alleged recording yet they refuse to put any hold on the account and are demanding payment for the fraudulent transactions.

Discover is using unfair tactics to force me to pay a fraudulent debt that is not mine. Further, they are deliberately damaging my perfect credit by submitting negative information to the credit bureaus about these fraudulent charges. 

I'm nearly XXXX years old and have always paid my bills. I did not authorize anyone to use my account and if Discover has any evidence to the contrary, they need to immediately produce such evidence before demanding I pay or damaging my credit.

This type of practice is unconscionable and Discover should be severely sanctioned for such practices. If they are doing this to me, It is likely they are targeting many other consumers with these same tactics."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I sold a XXXX XXXX watch on XXXX ( item # XXXX ) on XX/XX/2019. I received payment in the amount of {$7100.00} from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX user XXXX ) on XX/XX/2019 via PayPal ( transaction ID XXXX ). 
Subsequently, on XX/XX/2019, Mr. XXXX contacted his financial institution to reverse the charges, indicating the "" item was not as described. '' A dispute was opened up on PayPal ( Case ID : XXXX ). I provided XXXX tracking information ( tracking # XXXX ) to indicate the item was received. No complain or correspondence was received from Mr. XXXX. Mr. XXXX did not initiate the dispute on XXXX, nor PayPal. Mr. XXXX essentially bypassed the controls set in place for dispute resolution. 
Mr. XXXX 's financial institution reversed the charges, without requiring Mr. XXXX to return the merchandise. PayPal subsequently billed me for {$7100.00} charged by Mr. XXXX financial institution, without receiving the merchandise in return and has indicated there is nothing they can do to get it back."
Debt collection,"Heartland ECSI has predatory debt collecting processes. On XX/XX/2019, I enrolled in automatic payments to pay my account of XXXX dollars. The process was cancelled. On XX/XX/2019 I again, enrolled in automatic payments for XXXX dollars because I want to avoid the one time service fee. That also was cancelled. There is no way for these payments to fail on my side because I had given my routing number and my account number of my bank account, and I am fortunate enough to have a career that keeps my bank account full and ironically provide insights on how payment services work in financial industries. Now today XX/XX/2019. I called to complain why this is occurring and I received no explanation to why the payment did not go through. I was told that Heartland received my money, and then gave it back to my account. I asked them to enroll me in automatic payments and the operator that i was speaking to implied that if we the user enroll in their automatic payments it will not work. I asked the man to enroll me in automatic payments that will reflect my future XXXX dollar monthly payments and the man enrolled me in XXXX  future payments. I caved in today, payed the XXXX with the service fee because I do not want ANOTHER LATE FEE. People who are paying their debt to this agency are left with monitoring both workers and their pay system to make sure their money is going through. Further research on XXXX comment section indicates I am not the only one. This is easily a class action lawsuit. I am a XXXX XXXX  that works in PAYMENT SERVICES for XXXX XXXX, an international, billions of dollars net worth company, and this is extremely unacceptable from an agency whose only responsibility is to collect money."
Debt collection,"Shame on you CFPB how can you let this continue to happen, always all kinds of problems when companies use an auto dialer. I filed a complaint weeks ago and the company responded saying they found no proof. 

I am still to this day, even after contacting them in XXXX! We are still receiving receiving automated calls several times a day, caller ID indicates Navient or XXXX XXXX XXXX. If the phone is not answered they leave a message stating this is XXXX XXXX XXXX, if this is XXXX XXXX, the law requires us to notify you this is an attempt to collect a debt and information obtained will be used for that purpose. 

The caller ID is XXXX, XXXX, XXXX repeating several times a day. Since its the same message if I hang up without listing to it, it will call back repeating the same daily fashion. It is calling my landline phone consistently daily, not allowing to be opt out. Calls come from these numbers which if called, it rings busy. They are even spoofing the phone number to be XXXX XXXX XXXX I believe I am due damages of excessive calling and not allowing me to opt out of these messages, it leaves messages on the machine which indicate it is a debt collector. I have called asked them to stop one time it was a live person and I advised them it was a wrong number and advised them never to call the number again. they resumed calling the next week, and still do as of today. This time it is XXXX XXXX, last time it was. I even put this information in the followup complaint with CFBP that they are calling my phone number ... They are still calling my phone number they are calling is XXXX"
Credit card or prepaid card,"The credit card is set up with US Bank to auto-pay the full balance monthly and has worked well until XX/XX/XXXX. For XX/XX/XXXX, US Bank initiated the payment but did not post it until after the statement cutoff and showed the balance indicating the payment is overdue.

I contacted US Bank and was told all was well, the payment was posted but after the statement cutoff. In XX/XX/XXXX, the ACH showed up but was not for the outstanding balance after the XX/XX/XXXX payment was applied, rather US Bank took the entire amount for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX ; even through US Bank already received XX/XX/XXXX payment ( {$3100.00} vs. {$1000.00} that remained after the US Bank applied the XX/XX/XXXX payment ).

Since I budget funds in my checking account sufficient to cover actual debts between paychecks and invest the rest to earn a higher yield, this nearly double charge, if not timely remedied, will invoke my overdraft line of credit resulting in interest charges. I expect reimbursement for any costs created by US Bank."

Vehicle loan or lease,XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX New jersey Okay my experience with XXXX the salesman was XX/XX/XXXX. However be careful when when making deals here. They give the lowest trade value compared to anywhere. I bought a brand new XXXX cherokee. I drove off the lot traded in my car the same day. I didnt like the car after doing my daily routine one day later. I came back two later they didnt want to take return so I did a traded it in. Car lost 25 % of its value. Only about 100 miles or so. I understand that. However they didnt help with the big amount of money I gave them with my trade in. So I lost another XXXX $ getting into the other car that I still wasnt satisfied with. Which left me with an equity of {$3000.00} toward this car. Now thats stealership. I just want everyone else to be careful with what you do cause theres no going back once you sign those papers and whats gone is gone and it sucks i just handed these guys XXXX XXXX Lesson learned. Also theyll lie there giving more for your trade but all theyll do is use these random rebates to get the car price down. So you fall for it. You wont find out until the last paper you have to sign. Which is the 20 long legal paper in pink
Credit card or prepaid card,"From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX my Discover credit card has been extensively used by a scammer. I opened this card mainly for the purpose of balance transfer from another card, I set up a minimum amount to pay back every month, I barely used the card and did not pay attention to the billing statements. 

It was not until XX/XX/XXXX that I found out about the fraud amounts on this card, I contacted Discover right away and they promised me to resolve this ; within the month they returned the amounts disputed of {$250.00} back to my card, but that was not the full amount, Discover still owed me {$130.00} but I never heard from them again. 

I thought it'd be over and I could move on but no, the card was again used by scammers and charges continued to occur well into XX/XX/XXXX. I reported the issue to Discover and asked for a new card and the company again promised to resolve it. By this time, the overall charges were {$770.00}. Discover later refunded me {$540.00} but the remaining amount of XXXX XXXXwas never received. 

However, in XX/XX/XXXX Discover charged me {$460.00} out of the previous disputed amounts. In XX/XX/XXXX I  disputed for the third time against the amount charged in XX/XX/XXXX with them, and they again promised to help me. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I have not heard or received any response from them, I have called and followed up with the company at least 5 times. I just finished a phone call with Discover representative and was told the fraud department had completed the investigation one month ago on XX/XX/XXXX, and determined the charges were my liability. In addition, without any new information I can not open another dispute with them. However, during my previous followups nobody had told me if they made any progress in my case, and all of a sudden now they are telling me I am responsible for these charges. 

We are now burdened with an extra {$620.00} to pay which was fraudulently used. We have been working hard to pay off our debts, but with situations like this we will never achieve a debt free life. Please consider our complaint and uphold justice."

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2020 in the morning, I received an email from Wells Fargo alerting me that my Everyday Checking Account was a - {$47.00}. Early that afternoon, I went to my branch office and made a cash deposit of {$50.00} to clear up the negative balance by depositing {$50.00} in cash. Today I received another notice saying that I had a negative balance of the same {$47.00} even though I clearing up the issue the day before. Now however a {$35.00} overdraft fee was added in a very complicated way. I called the bank at XXXX this morning and spoke to a customer service rep who then explained their very complicated accounting system telling me that no matter if you have funds in your account and a purchase was deducted from your account for this purchase which reduces your available amount, if the merchant submits his payment request 3 days or a week later - if your funds are low at the time of the merchant request for payment, and you don't have enough in your account, you will be charged an overdraft fee ( if the bank decides to pay it ) regardless that the purchase amount was deducted when you made the purchase 3 days or a week ago. I believe that Wells Fargo has been scaling people with low balances. Wells Fargo has really hit me hard with fees since I have been depositing my COVID 19 unemployment checks. I tried to get the bank to waive this recent fee but to no avail. Help"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","So a few months ago I fell contacted Carmax auto Finance in regards to putting some of my past due payments on the back because I was no longer and fell behind .At first they were not willing to work with me, so I had to take the complaint a step further, which is when I was contacted by Carmax 's Executive offices, who agreed to place the past due payments on the back, once I paid down I want to say a month or so. Once I did that they would place the remaining past due payments on the back, and update the late payments with the credit bureaus, because I faced a hard ship. Yet here I am months later and my credit reports still shows the late pays and it showed that I missed a payment which I did not since they put the past due payments on the back of my loan. The end story is that they are being misleading, by not 100 percent following through with what they said. I am truly grateful that they put the late pays on the back of my loan. But yet they promised to remove the late pays and did not, and reported another false late on XX/XX/19. This is absolutely insane!!!"

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",I took out two loans with XXXX XXXX. This company is in XXXX Louisiana. The first loan was XXXX. I believe and the second loan was for XXXX. it may have been somewhat more. At the time I was extremely close to paying the first loan off. That was why I went for an additional loan and I was also in a financial bind. Well I was still making several payments until I had a legal issue which kept me from making payments. The next thing I know these people are sending court documents to my door asking over the loan actual amount after making all those payments to them. The strange part about it was I am having child support being stolen from me. This is a very small town. Well upon trying to get some of that theft down with filing my taxes. I felt some semi relief although I didnt owe the money. Which I want to report that to. These people actually re stole money from me through their company right after my income tax was garnished for the child support. So basically after I felt like I had some control with my life they put the same pressure on me the other way. sad to say im an XXXX or was trying to be. And I feel as if the child support was used as a publicity stunt because I was writing music about an XXXX named XXXX XXXX. My material leaked and the daughters fathers brother was making beats for several XXXX. Such as XXXX XXXX. He made a beat for a song called XXXX XXXX on the XXXX  CD. I had no clue. So the entire while everyone has been role playing on my life stealing money from me like im the XXXX XXXX. It has been happening to me for years. and I just want to have all on this on file in case something horrible happens to me. Or even happen to anyone else again in life. So I wouldnt have never thought that this loan company would stoop so low to actually steal money from me after I made so many payments to them. I was so timely with my payments before until I was making two and three payments to them at a time. its almost like they are stealing money from me thinking I have money or watching money before I have it. And I seriously dont. I had to flee the state from all the abuse and sad to say that it traveled its way where im at. And im just getting sick of it all. Throughout all this my son ended up getting shot and is now paralyzed. The stealing has not stopped. So I filed a complaint before about this company. yes they called and tried to tell me that they would let me pay over XXXX XXXX. well that was the amount that they called me to court for to begin with. I feel like the lady was trying to pull the wool over my shoulders and get me to agree to make the payments but that was the actual amount of the money they were asking for to begin with. After I had given them so much money. So basically They are stealing. then once I saw all the other like complaints about this company it just disgusted me. Then all the people that were working there before are not working there any more. So what really added insult to injury was the fact that I was teaching school in the morning and cleaning the school in the evening. These people were garnishing my entire check from child support being stolen right along with mailing me a letter garnishing my wages for this loan that was way more than the original loan itself. WALKING to get to this job. Walking from this job late at night. All of this I feel is a personal attack related to the industry. I already knew what the child support situation was about but I just never would have thought them people would play a role in using debt bondage to abuse me. It left me with extreme stress and it reflected me as being weak and unable to provide for my son and my daughter. I dont know what is wrong with these people or what they expect but I do not have any money for anyone to continue to keep stealing from me.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","Extremely brutal, acting secretly conspired, extremely dangerously, with no hesitation demonstrating outrageous power abuse at the Northwest Bank, bank manager XXXX XXXX. OnXX/XX/2019 he welcomed me with my translator and DPOA representative to do an international wire transfer and he did not tell at the beginning that we will need to come back on Monday, because at that point we could leave and just comeback on Monday. We have been sitting at his office for over 45 and up minutes to do paper work and after that he went to send the paper work for transfer to wire department. After his return he suddenly said that we will need to come back on Monday to sign the confirmation. He was acting strange. He said he needs to make a copy print of bank information for recipient. We felt like he is planning something and trying to do something bad to us. He did not give us a choice, he said it is requirement to get a bank information copy and went to do the copy. It took over 15 minutes. After that we felt something definetely is not right. He already put all the information on the system, so why he needs a copy of the bank information printed on paper? We asked for confirmation of wire transfer papers that he worked on and we spent over one hour, he said that he is not liable to give us anything. We came on Monday morning XX/XX/2019 little bit after XXXX XXXX. He was acting strange and definitely stretched the time and was acting busy with other employee XXXX. We have been waiting 2,5 hours and we asked how long does that process work, he said, he could not give us the time frame. He asked for best call number to call. He was acting like he and somebody else at the bank or maybe not at the bank thinking how do not do my wire transfer. We asked for information and rules for a wire transfer, for call number to that department that process wire transfers and may have questions to us, we asked to ask them to cal us if they have any questions. Every our request for that information was denied.It feels like with every our question the manager was getting annoyed and finally he called only me without my translator and representative and some man on the phone without introduction began telling me that the bank denied my request to do the wire transfer.My representative was not welcomed by manager and he tried to push her out. She asked the name of that person on the phone and they both refused to provide it. They refused to provide the valuable reason to deny to send wire transfer.This happens often when dishonest people hear the accent or knows that they can an advantage of my insufficient English, they do take an advantage. We felt that they want to do something with money that I already was late to send. Secret conspiracy, obstruction with false reason that bank trying to take care of me and prevent me from scammers was sound ridiculous and bank manager was look like a scammer that spy on me to target. What did they do for 2 and half hours keeping me in the dark and foolish around me and my representative. In the end the bank refused to give a cashier's check  in my name to put it whenever I want to in my name, but he demanded to give the name of the other bank or person and refused to write it in my name. He said that bank cannot give me any cash at all. The manager was inconsistent and lied and demonstrated his unfair practices in front of other bank employee XXXX. He made us sick. How mentally unstable people can get such important job at the bank? We felt that bank might want that money to do something for the bank. He offered to get cash on Wednesday only."
Mortgage,"In late XX/XX/XXXX after receiving my homeowners insurance renewal policy from XXXX XXXX the policy premium had increased over {$800.00} a year. I contacted my agent who quoted me through XXXX XXXX XXXX at a rate of {$1400.00} a year. I changed policies. I notified Homepoint via phone not to pay my XXXX renewal and was advised to send an email with the new declaration page. I did. However, Homepoint paid the XXXX policy and then also the XXXX XXXX policy. I received the refund at my home address from XXXX for {$2300.00}. I contact Homepoint and was advised to transfer those funds to them which I did electronically with check over the phone XX/XX/XXXX. The agent I spoke to said she would request an escrow analysis since there was over an {$800.00} difference in the insurance policies that I would be due a refund from my escrow. I waited almost 2 months before contacting Homepoint again. I called the end of XXXX - the XXXX I believe - and was told the matter was closed as of XX/XX/XXXX and no refund was due to me. I went through the numbers with the agent on the phone, she agreed and said she would escalate it to a manager. I called again on XX/XX/XXXX after not hearing anything from Homepoint and  was told it was set for a resolution on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not hear from anyone. I called again today XX/XX/XXXX and was told I am not due a refund. The math is as follows : My current escrow balance is {$1000.00}. My escrow obligation each year is {$1400.00} for insurance and {$1400.00} each cycle for taxes making my obligation {$4300.00} a year. They are currently posting {$350.00} of my {$1100.00} payment to escrow. With a current escrow balance exceeding {$1000.00} my escrow is well overfunded for XXXX and I would be due a refund under RESPA.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XXXX/XXXX I submitted certified letters to all 3 credit bureaus ( Equifax, XXXX, XXXX ). I disputed numerous inaccurate trade lines on my account. I requested that they verify all items and provide me with documentation. After the first attempt no changes were made. I then submitted another certified letter to them again on XX/XX/XXXX. This letter was again in dispute of inaccurate reported tradelines. I requested they be verified and original documentation be provided to me. This request again was not completed. I then sent them a third request via certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX restating the purpose of the letter was to manually investigate all items listed. They responded once again that they are making no changes and that all information was verified. Yet again my request for manual verification was completely ignored. I sent them one final 4th request on XX/XX/XXXX again by certified mail, restating for the 4th the items that needed to be verified or removed along with the the method, the name, and of course the original contracts that were signed with my signature.

Checking or savings account,"First let me say that this dispute is still currently in process as an investigation. I have an account with American Express Serve. I have been with them for over 3 years. On XX/XX/2019 around XXXX, my account was hacked by a person named XXXX XXXX twice in the middle of the night for {$500.00} and {$370.00} totaling {$870.00}. I was only able to pay one of my bills, XXXX, on this day due to my funds being cyphered as I was looking at my account on my phone.I actually receive an email at this hour stating that I sent this person the money as I am on the phone with the customer service representative. They gave me an invalid number to what was supposed to be the dispute department, which turned out to be a cruise line sweepstakes number ( XXXX ). In order to get back into my account, I had to call the CSR around XXXX as I was on my way to work because my account was locked due to numerous attempts to get back into my account after I had changed all my security measures after I got off the phone with CSR last the morning before. My account was opened only to be locked again later on that morning. My account had already been depleted to {$0.00}, but the person was still trying to access my account. Therefore, as I was on the phone with a supervisor, he changed my username so that my account would not be locked again. I still do not have any of my money because they insist on investigating the case more. I told them I would call back everyday until I have my money back. My account should have been FDIC insured, which means my money should have been returned to my account that day. I also filed a police report on XX/XX/XXXX19 and had to report that to them. I pulled up the unauthorized debit form and fax everything you see to them. By the way, I had to look up the dispute department number as well as the form and send it to them. They really did not help me through this entire process. I feel that this was done internally because of how this situation was pushed only by me. I am highly upset and hurt by this company. Every call is recorded supposedly, someone should listen to how well their customer service reps and supervisors ensure the happiness of their customers when it comes to people loosing their money."

Mortgage,"Im writing on behalf of my elderly/XXXX mother and father in law. 

In XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) was the servicer/ bank that held their mortgage. Due to major medical issues the kept my father in law from returning to the work force, and trying to avoid foreclosure they applied for a modification on the loan. XXXX, through a government program that was released in XXXX, granted the loan hardship/modification and fees etc were waived. They were to have a set mortgage payment every month without changing- something they could afford on their small fixed income. 

Since XX/XX/XXXX my Father in law is no longer in the picture.My mother in law took over the finances at the household and we were assuming she was doing fine. 

A couple months ago my mother in law came to us in a panic. She was about the lose the house and all her bills were or were about to be delinquent. After looking into we saw that at some point the loan servicer changed from XXXX and the new servicer SPS was charging her almost double then the modification agreement had stated. Plus they tacked on fees of close to 60k that was added with little to no explanation. 

I have called on MULTIPLE occasions asking for a copy of the modification agreement that was transferred from XXXX to SPS.I ahve also asked on multiple occasions for an explanation/ breakdown of added money. Through multiple recorded phone calls they have refused to provide either. They have supposedly looked everywhere for the modification agreement and it cant be found. Also they are refusing to send any type of explanation as to the money they have tacked on. 

We are looking to refinance the loan but the underwriters at XXXX XXXX will not move forward without the modification agreement or breakdown of the added funds. 

My ssenior/XXXX mother in law will foreclose and face homelessness  if this is not provided and taken care of right away."
Student loan,"I found a loan on my credit report that I knew had been paid in full. On my credit report it is listed as unpaid for the full XXXX dollar amount. I contacted Heartland ECSI and they directed me to their website to print any statements. The problem, however is the most recent statement available on their website is from XX/XX/2017 and in that statement it says I owe the full XXXX dollars. I paid them the full XXXX on XX/XX/2017, however there is no statement after XX/XX/2017 that says my money was received and the balance is XXXX. All I wanted was a form showing the XXXX balance so I could send that to the credit agency and get this resolved. Instead they made me feel like a dead beat. This service company is criminal. They cause immense amounts of stress and overall life disruption with their sloppy practices. This all happens and the consumer ultimately pays the price."

There was no reference to what I actualy purchased and the text only referenced XXXX  NOT XXXX called they didn't give me address to even send it nor an electrical address to send the payment. At the end of XXXX, they had informed XXXX that the purchased were fraudulent, they were not. I complained to an agency because of bad business practices ; not bad merchandise. I sent them a check for the remainder of the balance. Then I received a myriad of message that stated I was 'displeased ' by my products and they reneged paying those merchants. I never said that and demanded from XXXX  they repay the merchants with the monies I already used. I also demanded they cancel my credit card. I spoke to a representative and they promise to pay the merchants and reimburse me. Last week, I received a check from them figuring I overpaid them. Today, I got a letter from them demanding the money back. Thus far they have no evidence that they even paid the merchants and I know overpaid them. I want the matter resolved.."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, there was a fraud charge on my card. I informed My banking institution, they gave me provisional credit for XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX the provisional credit was taking back, i called the bank and i ask them why did they take the money out of my account, the banker told me it was taking because they did not receive my my claim back that was mail to me, i informed her that i did not receive the form. The lady informed me that the claim was put in as a dispute, i informed her that it was not a dispute that it was fraud. So the lady informed me that since this was fraud that they were going to wave the check fees. The lady also told me that i had to go to my home branch and sign the documents, then they could rush my provisional credit, so i went to the home branch and sign the documents. then i called the bank again and informed them that i went to the home branch and signed the documents the lady told me ok, then she told me i will receive the provisional credit in three days.I called the bank back on XX/XX/XXXX what happened to my provisional credit, the lady informed me that my claim was denied, and that is why i did not receive the credit. I informed the banker how could she deny my claim when they made the mistake and file it as a dispute and it was fraud, and i did not make this charge. I informed the banker my wallet was lost. and someone found my wallet and use my debit card, my pin was in my wallet because i had a head injury so i forget stuff real fast. I also informed the credit beaural That my Identification was stollen also. they waved the fees but they denied the claim."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX a guard rail was damaged in a vehicle accident on the Florida XXXX. The driver of a truck owned by me was run off the road, Even though there were 2 witnesses to this fact the Trooper ( she was new/in training had to call her supervisor to ask what to do ) charged him with the accident. We hired an attorney and the witness statements were reviewed so it was dismissed, no charges to the driver. XXXX XXXX company confirmed if no charges then there is no liability to pay for the guard rail. This was all communicated to : XXXX XXXX Claims Assistant, Office of the General Counsel - FDOT, XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Florida XXXX, Phone : ( XXXX ) XXXX Fax : ( XXXX ) XXXX.

It stated I could dispute within 30 days and they would mail back to me a verification of this debt. I then sent them a dispute letter via certified mail and I have proof they received it XX/XX/XXXX. I requested they check with FDOT as there is no liability on my part and I requested they close the case as invalid. As of today they have not mailed me any type of verification. They continue to have their agents call and leave messages that I need to pay this invalid debt. When I call back asking about my dispute no one will even acknowledge I sent one. I am being harassed over a debt that XXXX XXXX Co would have promptly paid if I owed it. I have a full property damage policy. I have again written to them today requesting they cease and desist."
Vehicle loan or lease,"The essence of the complaint is that I am being charged for damage ( XXXX Door Panel Heavy Scratch @ {$2200.00} ), which plainly did not exist prior to my surrendering my leased vehicle on XX/XX/XXXX. This is backed up by clear photographic evidence, which has been sent to Chase, per their instructions via hard copy twice, and yet continues to go unaddressed. After multiple phone calls there is no clear path offered by Chase to resolve this issue. 

The vehicle leased was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Acct # XXXX XXXX. 

This complaint is regarding JPMorgan Chase Bank XXXX Chase XXXX, which operates XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX : XXXX. The end of lease group in Texas has been the source of the frustration. Key factors are their inability to work with electronic files OR receive hard copy mail, mixed with their general apathy and attitude, which, after several phone calls, offers no real help or suggested path to resolution. An issue that could have been resolved in a matter of minutes continues to drag out over a month with no clear path to resolution in sight. 

Additional detail, organized in date order and with reference to supporting documents are as follows : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Report identifies limited damage totalling {$200.00}. 

XXXX - XXXX XXXX father enters hospice and passes away from terminal XXXX. I asked to extend my lease during this period. However my driving was severely limited, and no subsequent damage occurred. 

XXXX I take photos in various conditions of the vehicle prior to turning it in. These six photos are included in the subsequent correspondence to Chase - these indicate no damage to the XXXX Door Panel prior to the vehicle being surrendered to the transport truck driver. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX truck sent by Chase picks up the vehicle from my home in downtown XXXX XXXX there is no dealership involved - pickup arranged with Chase due to Covid ). 

XX/XX/XXXX Date of first letter from Chase, identifying a variety of small damage items, including those identified in the pre-inspection report, which I do not dispute. However a significant and unexpected line item is introduced, which is described as XXXX Door Panel Heavy Scratch and has a cost assigned of {$2200.00}. This is the disputed charge that has yet to be addressed. 

XX/XX/XXXX After catching up with mail and reading the letter, I call Chase - the lease end group in Texas at XXXX - to inquire about how the inspection occurred, and ultimately to dispute the XXXX Door Panel Heavy Scratch line item. I am told a separate research department will review the photos from the inspection. They will drop any charges for which they do not find photos. I can also request to have the photos sent, which I do. 

I found the nature of this call to be unsettling. I was told that this stays with this department 100 days, and I dont want to know what happens after that. I found the tone to be generally aggressive and threatening, as if I had been sent to a debt collector vs a customer service department with any kind of curiosity as to my situation. 

XX/XX/XXXX Document Attached : Correspondence from Chase Date of letter from Chase with grainy photos printed on ordinary copy paper. Only one of these images identifies the supposed XXXX Door Panel Heavy Scratch. If it is in fact on the XXXX Door Panel ( difficult to validate via this one picture ), it was certainly not there when I surrendered the vehicle to the transport driver. 

XX/XX/XXXX I call Chase to explain the situation all over again, this time to XXXX. I was told to mail my photos to a very specific address, which was provided by XXXX as follows : Chase XXXX XXXX : XXXX Department XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX I asked XXXX to repeat as some elements seemed strange like the PO Box number with a comma, etc. She acknowledged it was strange but this was the address. It will turn out later this was an incorrect address. 

XX/XX/XXXX I mail a letter with my photos and the pre-inspection report via XXXX Priority Mail - the tracking indicates it was not delivered. 

XX/XX/XXXX I call Chase and ask to speak to a supervisor. I speak with XXXX, ID # XXXX. XXXX is not initially curious or helpful. I have to ask him to look up the address for me and verify what XXXX provided was correct. When he finally does, it turns out to be a different zip code. The address is provided as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXX Mail XXXX : XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX Attn : Research XX/XX/XXXX Document Attached : Damage Dispute Letters to Chase I print out all my hard copies again - revised letter/address, photos, pre-inspection report, and sent by Priority Express Mail. This time the tracking indicates it was delivered early on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX After seeing the letter and photos have been delivered for over a week, and I have not heard anything from Chase, despite the fact they said they would call. I call the following numbers : XXXX XXXX XXXX Customer Service at XXXX - they listen but say they can not help with anything regarding Chase. They suggest I find out if Chase has a complaint department. No such department for dealing with this issue can be found online or on the phone. No matter who I call I am always redirected to the same end of lease group in Texas that has been so difficult to work with. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX Customer Service at XXXX - after asking for a supervisor and explaining the situation - they simply reconnect me to XXXX in Texas and the same group that again has not been helpful this whole time When I am redirected to XXXX ID # XXXX, I provide the tracking number for the second mailing, which he looks up to see it was in fact delivered. However XXXX says they dont have the photos. I ask how is that possible? - I have mailed them twice and reconfirmed the address with XXXX himself. The XXXX says its delivered. XXXX says, I dont know what to tell you. If were not getting anything, we cant waive it. XXXX says the only next step is arbitration. I ask if he has a supervisor. He says yes but it takes XXXX XXXX for that individual to call me back. He will mail me the lease contract, which describes arbitration as the only option left. 


Obviously this has taken a lot of my time and resources, with multiple phone calls, mailings, printing out of photos, documenting, etc. A reasonable customer service agent would be able to determine in about XXXX XXXX that the XXXX Panel Heavy Scratch occurred after I turned in the vehicle. Yet the Chase lease end office in Texas feels more like a debt collector than a customer service office. This group is at best apathetic, sometimes threatening, and surely not helpful. I have spent my own resources printing photos and putting together hard copies and mailed them TWICE per their direction, and yet they dont know what to say about it, using the excuse they have not received what XXXX confirmed was delivered. 

It is shocking to me that in the year XXXX Chase Bank can not receive photos or correspondence electronically. Having said that, if they claim to deal with hard copy only, they do not have a reliable way to receive hard copies either, so they leave consumers with no viable options to resolve simple issues. The fact that the XXXX XXXX name is attached to this group also is not helpful - XXXX XXXX will not act as Chase holds the lease and only uses their name apparently for branding/marketing. And the internal customer service at XXXX XXXX XXXX is powerless to act - they simply steer me back to the office in Texas, which again leaves no resolution. In the meantime, this drains my resources, and ultimately puts my credit at risk, as it seems their only strategy is to drag their feet until their threat of 100 days, when it turns over to collections."

I called the east XXXX  branch and they said I have to call claims so I did. They said east XXXX reported it to collections in XX/XX/XXXX since they did not have the funds. If they have a system issues that's on their end. I already paid the balance before it was due months ago. They said they would look into ot further and has not gotten back to me and now I am receiving another piece of mail saying it is going to be sent to collections of not paid in 10 days.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XX/XX/2019 I received an alert from Experian that my credit score had dropped 6 points without any explanation. I have had no negative activity in years. I looked at he report and it suddenly showed 2 negative marks - both from over 6 years ago but suddenly reported as current. XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX I disputed both corporation 's information on XXXX XX/XX/2019 I received a notice the disputes had been resolved. Nothing changed, but my credit score immediately dropped another 20 points! There had been no other intervening activity on my report. Consequently my score dropped 20 points simply because I disputed to claims. This is illegal. I called a second time to dispute this entire process. The customer care contacted XXXX XXXX and that was determined to by inaccurate information and was removed, but my credit score did not change! They lowered my score based on inaccurate information and when the information was corrected they failed to return the score to its previous state. The supervisor failed o address my question gave me nothing but bureaucratic circular reasoning and hung up the phone, She refused to provided her name. I spoke to her on XXXX/XXXX/209 at XXXX PM est. Experian is failing to report accuate information,. dropping my score without explanation or reason based on disputes which were in one case verified. They are preventing me for obtaining credit necessary for my livelihood. I intend to bring a court case against if this is not resolved."
Checking or savings account,"Wells Fargo has sent me several general form letters in regard to opening of unauthorized accounts and resolution of fees charged to these accounts, the letters want to know if I am satisfied with resolution.. The resolution includes a refund check in the amount of XXXX. This is the only refund I received, which does not cover total fees charged including overdraft fees.. This refund was made as part of Wells Fargo Settlement which again, is only a small portion of fees charged to unauthorized accounts which I believe include a total of two or three. The fees run into the hundreds I believe, however, I do not have an exact total as the accounts are all now closed and do not have access to them. I request a refund of total fees charged to these accounts which were not authorized. Failing that, I request Wells Fargo to cease sending these letters asking if I am satisfied with resolution as I am clearly not."
Student loan,"My student loans were defaulted even though I was enrolled at school. They started the timer on my payments when I should have been under the protection of In School Deferred payment status. From the day you leave school you have 6 months before you start making payments. As you can see by my transcripts I was enrolled in school and the timer for payments was started while in school which lead to a default that was inaccurate. 

I was notified of default and spoke to NMEAF to advise I was enrolled during those periods that they have me as delinquent. Had my information been accurate I would not have been in default. Even with giving NMEAF this information they chose to leave my loans in default status. This benefits NMEAF as they receive payment from the government. 

The affects of this Default are far reaching, 1. I have had to pay a higher interest rate being that I had to consolidate my loans. This has raised my overall payment and is costing more money.

2. I am disqualified from Public Service Loan Forgiveness with a default. I am a XXXX XXXX and was planning on working for PSLF. 
3. It has ruined my credit report due to the default and the inaccuracies that NMEAF choses to report. 

First delinquency is showing XX/XX/XXXX with default taking place in XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to NMEAF about my enrollment status that same month XX/XX/XXXX, I consolidated my student loans that same month."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX and Transunion are reporting incorrectly a late payment in XXXX, 2019 on the XXXX/XXXX   XXXX account. I never received a statement in the mail so I paid over what I thought was the outstanding balance. Unfortunately, the interest carried over and I was short on the monthly payment by a fraction. I wasnt aware of a late payment until I looked at my most recent credit report and saw there was a late charge. I immediately paid the amount required. However, due to not receiving my statement and not being properly notified of the late payment, I respectfully request that this late payment be removed from my credit report. This incorrect reporting is harming my credit score."
Mortgage,"I've tried multiple times to resolve my complaint with PennyMac Loan Services but they continually fail to do so. Their "" Priority '' Complaint Specialist, XXXX, will say anything to get a problem to go away and refuses to acknowledge all of PennyMac 's negligence. When applying for a highly time critical purchase loan for an investment property, the company failed several times to properly and timely communicate, additionally to accurately address my file. The company filed to accurately review my file, did not respond five ( 5 ) times during an open application during this critical time period - it was not until the sixth ( 6th ) attempt that someone did return my call. Most recently another team member, XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX, was to also to contact me to further discuss this matter. Naturally he never called. Very typical for PennyMac. I don't see how this this company has a license to lend or really do anything. There are laps and failures at all levels. 

Never properly reviewed my financials, never contacted me with any questions, and later I found out that they double counted a mortgage payment and my auto payment. - Note that XXXX called this ( multiple times ) a "" Complex '' review. 
Six ( 6 ) attempts to reach someone during my application. The first five ( 5 ) were never returned. XXXX refuses to acknowledge this ; probably to the gross negligence that it was on their part. 
No other company who reviewed my financials had any problem and even said I could qualify for much more. 
Only declined after I have filed complaints. Retaliation by PennyMac.

Unfortunately they caused me critical time that significantly impacted me financially in addition to a great deal of stress. 
Most recently another team member was supposed to contact me. NEVER called. Not that I expect anything different from him, just continues to show the character and lack of leadership at PennyMac."
Mortgage,"I have an adjustable rate mortgage that has been sold to or purchased by XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX took over my loan in late XXXX. Thus far there has been irregularities for 7 of the 8 months they have held the loan. Payments in XXXX XXXX we placed in a reserve account instead of being placed towards the loan because they claim that we were not paying enough each month. The loan has been set up on an automatic draft since XX/XX/XXXX. When I discovered the issue in XXXX, it took about 2 days to get the information corrected, the money placed in the appropriate place, and the draft corrected. We were told there would be not late payments. The issue occurred because we were not issued a rate change letter for our ARM, and to this date we still do not have that letter. I was told the new payment would be {$370.00}. and some change. In XXXX, 2 months late charges appeared the account. I again called customer service and was told it was an error and would be corrected. In XXXX, a larger payment than we were told was drafted from my checking account. When we called we were again told that there was a computer issue and it would be corrected. I again requested a copy of the rate increase notice. I also requested a payoff as I have decided to refinance. On the payoff, it notes that my current interest rate is 5.125 %. On my XXXX statement, my interest rate is now 5.250 %. The second change this year. This is in violation of my ARM which states one interest rate change per year beginning at the XXXX mortgage payment. I will be closing with a new finance company on XX/XX/XXXX."
Debt collection,"This is in response to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX. ( XXXX ) CFPB response to complaint XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX.

This is not only unethical, it's illegal. 5XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stated they provided me a copy of all origination related documents pertaining to account # XXXX.

However, in XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX response they included a document entitled "" Arbitration Rider ''  as part of the alleged loan documents. I have never seen this document and XXXX has never provided it to me as a result of my numerous inquiries. As a result, I would like XXXX to explain why it was not sent with the documents requested and provide a copy of the document and any other document ( s ) they neglected to send me in their XX/XX/XXXX correspondence. Either the document does not exist and XXXX fabricated it, or XXXX has once again been negligent in performing their duties. Please advise, I continue to assert XXXX continues to act in a fraudulent manner and misrepresents their legal abilities as a servicer/debt collector."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Ive had severe issues with the student loan process for at least 10 years. An on going fraudulence has occurred on my student loans which I believe started with identity theft. Im unable to get resolution and require legal assistance. Ive contact every department related to my claims & accounts for the past 3 years. I only get people taking my personal & private information and telling me to pay up or else! No one will actually help me. They defaulted my loans. Triple the loan amounts for no reason. Change servicing companys often. I need them to stop harassing me. Stop garnishing my wages. Stop taking my tax returns that are ONLY CHILD TAX CREDITS. Stop ruining my credit so I cant even have a place to live. The lenders dont answer the phone.

Debt collection,"Hello! 

RSI Enterprises is threatening to claim debt collection to a citation issued by XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for a supposed photo "" stop sign violation '' and a {$100.00} fine ( now {$130.00} after collection fees ) from 2015. I finally received a collections letter dated this month. There is no available proof online that this even occurred, no video of the supposed violation nor of the driver to prove that I was driving. 

Firstly, I never agreed to pay this debt, therefore this is considered invalid right off the bat. There is not a posted sign at the entrance to this private property park and therefore does not constitute a Legal Contract. Secondly, the laws clearly state that a "" promise to pay '' MUST exist before anyone can post to a credit report ... deeming this a false claim on collections. 

It is illegal for out of state companies to claim collections on private property that are n't legally enforced. When driving on public roads and am cited for a violation, by LAW, the officer must have the suspect sign that claims they will be responsible for any/all debts or fees that are incurred by said violation. 

Many others have also had this happen to them ; some fight it in court, some just ignore the claims by RSI Inc.. It seems that ignoring the collection letters is completely valid due to their acting on illegal collections and because there are no DMV restrictions or appearance on credit reports ... just proving even further that this a scam run by XXXX. 

Thanks for submitting this company and hopefully we can fight to take them down with everyone else that has had these illegal debt collections sent to them."

I contacted XXXX and was told the original date of delinquency dated back to XX/XX/XXXX. I explained to XXXX that the creditor was still reporting this file beyond the 7 year statue of limitations. XXXX instructed me to contact Tranword System. 

I contacted Transworld system and was told to challenge the inaccuracy on the report. I explained to Transworld I had already done so.

Transworld sent me a copy of the last bill XXXX billed me for, dated XX/XX/XXXX. 
I explained to the Transworls agent, and several supervisors, that XX/XX/XXXX was the LAST date of delinquency and not the first. I was then instructed to call XXXX to get proof. 

I called XXXX and spoke with several layers of supervisors. I explained that Transworld was reporting an incorrect date. They said to talk to Transworld. I asked XXXX to please send me copies of all my statements as proof that the original date of delinquency occurred in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX agrees with my date. However, I was told that XXXX did a computer update XX/XX/XXXX. I was told my request was impossible as all statements of charged off account prior to XX/XX/XXXX have been permanently purged. 

I'm stuck in a vicious circle of the original creditor and the collection agency both pointing the finger at XXXX another. 

It is my understanding that the collection agency must verify this information. Transworld does not seem to want to take the time to understand my specific complaint. It appears all I get are computer generated templates. 

Sending me a copy of the last bill XXXX has ever sent me is terrific. It's not what the complaint is. The complaint is SPECIFICALLY the date of first delinquency of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Can you please help me resolve this and if needed can you guide me on how to sue this collection agency. Thank you."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/2019, I received a piece of mail from a company called Netspend. I open the mail to find an offer to sign up for a prepaid debit card. I usually don't get authentic cards in the mail when I get offers, but this was a legit card that was created without my consent with instructions included to activate the card. 

Upon calling the number to question why I received this card -- it was evident this was not fraudulent -- because the automated recording gave an explanation as to why I received this offer. In that same call I chose to "" cancel the card and opt-out of future mailings '' I'm sending this message to you because I take my credit health every seriously. It's very insulting and disgusting that Netspend is allowed to create a real account without my consent. With all of the fraud and money laundering that exists today, I could have very well thrown away the mail ( which I usually do ) that contains an actual card, and could have become a victim of fraud.

It is extremely negligent for them to practice this type of advertising.

This may not be fraud from an individual, but this is actually  fraudulent from Netspend. I would like to know the steps an individual can take to file a lawsuit against a company like this."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX I was denied employment due to credit. The job was financial related and required a good credit report. Two weeks later I was denied housing because the company stated my credit report showed debt to another housing provider. I pulled my Experian credit report and discovered an inordinate amount of errors. There were over 50 errors total on my report. I sent them a letter immediately explaining and showing in detail why each item was an error and asked them to investigate and resolve. In XX/XX/XXXX they sent me back a letter saying that they had completed an investigation and verified all information. It was a very blanket letter not outlining how they conducted any investigation. I then sent them a response showing that these were in fact errors and should be either updated or deleted ( based upon each individual line item 's situation ). The response I received was almost an identical letter to the first one they sent. It did not address any of the my concerns at all. Overall I have repeatedly contacted this company in hopes that they would resolve these errors and they have not. Ive sent letters in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX immediately upon receiving their repossess and have receipts of certified my mail being received by them each time. To date I am still unable to secure housing or a suitable job because of these errors. I. work in finance and can not afford to have such errors on my report. In addition to all of the negative errors I also discovered thatchy are not reporting at all on many of my positive credit lines. I have contacted my credit card companies to confirm that they report to the bureaus nd each confirmed that indeed they do report. Therefore there is no sufficient reason why my positive credit lines are not reported and thus why all of these erroneous negative items are reported. I am in a world of trouble because of this negligence and they just keep sending back the same letter saying they verified the items. There is no way to verify something that never happened. When I asked for proof of these items belonging to me in the form of anything I authorized or signed or even recordings where I gave approval I received nothing repeatedly. Please help me.

We received notices from the current loan servicer Select Portfolio Servicing as to the rate increase and that we should take the opportunity to apply for a loan modification. Select Porfolio did not process the loan modification in good faith, thus engaging in Floridas deceptive business practices. The payments increased to {$1600.00}, when i ask why such an increase, was told by a representative that was due to not having a previous escrow account. This statement is false i have attached a copy of the mortgage statement for your records that proves that the account always has maintain an escrows, in fact since the loan originated. In addition According the mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX reflects a monthly due of {$800.00}. Then suddenly the mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX reflect that we are behind {$7100.00}. Clearly this a fraud. If on XXXX the amount owed was {$800.00} because was making timely payments i can not possibly owe {$7000.00} the following month. Select Portfolio has inflated the amount owed. Moreover, the loan modification proposal reflects a ballon at the end of the loan in the amount of {$53000.00}, which we are not in arrears such amount. It is obvious that Select portfolio has engaged in deceptive business practices and we ask that you investigate. Select portfolio have increase the loan balance without any justification and this is fraud. At this juncture we will not be sending any future payments until the account is given credit for the fraudulent loan balance increased. On XX/XX/XXXX, we send two Qualified Written Request to select Portfolio Servicing under Section 6 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ( RESPA ). The company failed to acknowledge our request within 5 business days and also failed to respond within 20 days of receipt.

Student loan,"I renewed by XXXX in XXXX of 2018. Against my wishes and application, my loan servicing company ( Great Lakes ) placed me into PAYE. This caused me to acquired increased interest as none of the interest is subsidized. They have since rectified placing me into the wrong IBR plan, but the will not rectify the additional interest that accrued during this time. Additionally, now the interest has capitalized into my principal, which will cost me thousands by the time I am done with repayment. 

The first individual I spoke with at Great Lakes assured me that this was an error on their end, and it was no fault of my own. This seems to no longer be their story. 

The short detail of this is that my interest shouldn't have capitalized due to their mistake, and there is more interest than there should be, had they placed me into the repayment program I desired ( REPAYE )."

They said theyve given all they can and they can no longer accept any phone calls.

The last 2 attachments are from verbal verifications we did on the phone with you ( The Money Source ), XXXX and the borrower. That is what we prefer. However, if you are unable to do a verbal again - that is fine. We can accept something showing The Money Sources name on the top.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer, I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from my credit files. 1.

Debt collection,"I took out a high interest rate loan with the company Sun Loans in XX/XX/2017. That company closed suddenly and without notice.

I worked with the company trying to make arrangements to pay as their collection calls were coming in at least 3 times a day every weekday. If I didn't pick up the phone, they would call my friends and relatives whom I had listed as references on my Sun Loans accounts. 
I finally wanted XXXX XXXX to prove to me that I owed them the debt from the other loan company. They sent what was claimed to be a "" court document '' to prove they bought my loan. It was just a typed up document with no official markings like a judge 's signature or a docket number. 
When I informed XXXX XXXX that I would be a filing an official complaint against them, the manager became more aggressive and demeaning ( even yelling at me ) insisting I was just trying to get out of my debt. He then informed me he would put it on my credit report if I didn't pay. After about 6 months of harassing me, my friends and family, I was able to block all of their phone numbers. Unfortunately my friends and family were not able to do so. 
I pay debts that are mine, but they are expecting me to pay a random company I have never done business with just on their word. 
I have included some of the collection notices and a copy of my original contract with Sunloans.

I'm not sure why they are purposely trying to mess up my credit, other than not wanting to except they were wrong in the first place to give me a 30 day late in XXXX when I was not late. I feel that XXXX is purposely trying to punish me because I fought this mistake they made. How can I go with no lates with this account since XX/XX/XXXX, and now all of a sudden lates are coming from everywhere on a closed account. This is not fair or ethical for a business to do. The credit bureaus also are not investigating this matter, they are excepting whatever XXXX says and reporting it. Now XXXX is showing that the account was closed XX/XX/XXXX, when it was closed years before. If XXXX had answered my request of verification when I first asked for this in writing, none of this would be happening. Although they claim their was an issue on their end with the closing of this account, I don't see how that's possible when they closed it, as I had no access to it anymore and it was updated on my credit report as closed."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I am very concerned about the validity and accuracy of the recent investigation done by Experian. I requested for an investigation because the accounts have nothing to do with me. I am a victim of identity theft and the accounts are not my responsibility. Experian failed to give me the result of their investigation. I assume they were unable to verify it. The error has affected my credit score tremendously. CFPB please step up and delete this ASAP, this is very exhausting, nobody wants to grant me a loan because of this.

Mortgage,"Shortly after closing on my loan which took place approx. XX/XX/2016 my loan was sold and began Servicing with Lakeview who services through XXXX. I contacted the number on my statement back in 2016 to set up what I believed to be a bi-weekly payment structure. As evidenced by my withdrawals in my checking {$400.00} per month has been pulled from my account for quite some time. Today I contacted them and was told XXXX does not do bi-weekly payments they pay the investor which I understand to be Lakeview on a month to month basis. So they have been getting 1/2 of my payment then holding for the remaining and when a full payment is in hand then they make the payment. This is frustrating because this is not necessarily how this was explained back in 2016. I asked to reach Lakeview directly and was given an 800 # to contact them. This went to a different 3rd party company that promoted a equity excellorator program ( aka bi-weekly payment ) plan. They wanted {$290.00} enrollment fee and $ 5.40ish per month for a servicing charge. I asked them if they were either Lake View and or XXXX and a guy named XXXX stated they are neither. Reflecting back I think this also is the same procedure I went through in 2016 and have already paid this set up and servicing charges. I think there is something very strange in the way I keep getting bounced to XXXX, they don't acknowledge that they are in fact the ones pulling money from my account each month yet they are listed on each withdrawal. And now this 3rd company of which is neither XXXX nor Lakeview wants to reset this up with me again and can not find any record of my account anywhere. I can not seem to locate a direct phone contact number to Lakeview to discuss this, and keep getting rerouted back to XXXX. This feels very fishy and I feel the past 2+ year I have paid for a service that I am not getting and there is some sort of scam or fraud going on that I can not pin down and need help. I feel there has been a difference in the money I have paid out vs what has been correctly applied to my loan and would love to see this analyzed fully."

I clearly stated that I personally I have nothing to do with any of charges posted on that card. 
Today XX/XX/2019 I received letter stating that my claim was denied based on the matter that I personally called and confirmed transactions from my phone. 
They provided me with new number XXXX then XXXX XXXX for additional assistance. 
At the time of the claim opening I specifically stated that I never called and confirmed any of the charges. 
I contacted my phone company to find out if technology used today can give access to someone else 's phone without their knowledge and was confirmed that it is unfortunately a possibility. 
I am clearly a victim of identity fraud."
Debt collection,"On XX/XX/18, My wife and I went to the Best Buy Mobile store in XXXX, FL to change our cell phone service from XXXX XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. At that time, we agreed with the terms to buy one XXXX XXXX and get the second one free. However, we couldn't finalize our contract due to a compudter problem. We were asked by the Best Buy employees to return the next day to complete our contract. When entering the Best Buy Mobile store on XX/XX/18, we were told that both of our new XXXX XXXX 's would be free due to the computer problem from the previous day. We were also told the the store would have to eat the cost ( {$690.00} plus tax ). Of course we agreed to the new terms. For 8 months from XX/XX/18, XXXX XXXX did not bill us for phones. In fact, they gave us a discount for bringing our new XXXX to the new XXXX XXXX Plan. Then on XX/XX/18, we added our daughter to our XXXX account. The phone she added was an XXXX XXXX, and was fully paid for. As a result, XXXX determined that we were not being charged for our XXXX XXXX 's, and backed billed us {$480.00} in XXXX. Before this, we were paying {$60.00} or less for our two lines. I was a bit upset that we were to pay for phones that we were told were free by Best Buy. I called XXXX XXXX several times about this, and finally talked to XXXX corporate ( Mr. XXXX, phone # XXXX ). He told me that XXXX needed reimbursed, and since Best Buy Mobile made the mistake, that they needed to give us a credit, or that they needed to pay XXXX. Then I contracted Best Buy at XXXX about what happened. Best Buy started a file ( XXXX # XXXX ), and referred me to there supervisor XXXX XXXX. For 2 1/2 weeks we emailed numerous times. Thru our emails, she told me that Best Buy Mobile mis-coded our phones as being unlocked. It is now my understanding, that after 8 months of not paying for our phones, that we are to pay 100 % for there mistake. I don't think this is not good business practice, and is why we're asking for help. We previous submitted this same complaint to the Federal Trade Commision, but they recomemded to send our complaint to you. We told Best Buy that honest mistakes do happen, and would be willing to pay something. It seems to me, if a codeing error was made, that it would have been a simple fix. Best Buy Mobile employee are experts when it come to mobile phone, why would they just say there was a computer error, and say our phone were free.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I setup a new account yesterday in order to freeze or unfreeze my credit reporting then logged off and attempted to log back in to check my ability to access the account. 
Unfortunately I could not log back in to the account and after three attempts was locked out. I waited 30 minutes and attempted again without success. ( Twice ) I then called the Equifax help line and after answering 8 security question about my history + SSN, DOB they said they could not grant me access to my account. I asked for the supervisor and she said they could not help me because I was using the wrong browser, i.e. XXXX XXXX XXXX and said I had to use XXXX. This company seems to be very backwards in technology and would ask you investigate their web site for cross-platform access by all the common browsers. 
Still don't have access to my account and am very frustrated with this company. I do have access to the other two credit reporting agencies without any problem but not Equifax.

Also there should be federal rule that we the consumer should have the choice which credit reporting agency we want to use. This regional selective option should not be but use of any of at least the three major ones should be selected by the consumer.

Will need to refer this to our congressman. This is not consumer friendly. For example, If someone has a dispute with the only credit reporting agency a loan company uses there can adverse problems with making a purchase during that period even though the other two agencies show good credit and are accessible. I think it was a cop-out that the supervisor said we needed to use a XXXX platform to access our account and ask you look into this. I will pursue breaking up the regional credit reporting agency limitations by financial loan institutions with my Congressman We the people should be able to choose which credit reporting agency should be used.

Student loan,"On approximately XX/XX/XXXX my wife and myself pre-qualified for student loan refinancing through Sofi. After entering in all of the qualifying questions and criteria we were presented a rate of approximately 2 percent and told that this rate would be held for 30 days, pending a complete application. On XX/XX/2019, I logged on to finish the application by uploading various co-signer documents. Once these documents were uploaded, we were then offered a rate of 4.19 percent, over doubling the amount offered during pre-qualification. On XX/XX/2019, I called the Sofi student loan department to see what the cause of this large increase was and I was told that it was due to "" income verification '' ; however, the income stated during qualification did not change when I uploaded the verifying documents. In addition, we did not have any additional debt that would cause our DTI ratio to increase. This practice seems deceptive as they make you go through the whole process before describing your actual rate, which is significantly higher than the rate they initially disclose. In addition, the representative made it seem like our age played a factor in the decision to increase the wage."
Mortgage,"Selene finance incorrectly determined that there was a lapse in my home owners insurance. As a result, they purchased a policy on my behalf without notifying me. This increased my monthly payment, also without notifying me. I continued to pay my regular monthly mortgage payment on time. They perceived a discrepancy in the monthly amount due. As a result, as I paid my monthly amount, they held it in an "" unapplied status '', meaning they did not apply it to the account. They just held it. Also did not notify me. This made the account overdue. which it was not. They then reported an over 30 days past due amount to the credit bureau. Selene has all payments up to date yet is reporting past due. This has caused me to be denied a refinance loan and is negatively affecting my credit report. I have tried to call them, email them and use their online chat feature. Each time I am met with confusion on their part. I have made 3 phone calls to address the {$2500.00} that is being held but not applied to the loan. Each time I am told it is resolved, then it is not resolved."
Debt collection,"In my phone call to UNIFUND CCR, LLC on XX/XX/2019 at approximately XXXX EST to settle an open lawsuit against me, the UNIFUND CCR , LLC representative stated that the default judgement was being processed. When asked to clarify as I was entitled to 20 days from the date of receipt of the notice before a default judgement would be issued, she repeated the same phrase again. 

As I am entitled to 20 days from the date of notice to respond to lawsuits before a default judgement is issued, and the date of notice was XX/XX/2019, on the date of the phone call, no default judgment could have been being processed. Therefore, their agent used false or misleading representation and violated the FDCPA.

The Federal Debt Collection Practices Act 807 ( 2 ) ( B ) states clearly that "" A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. [ ... ] the following conduct is a violation of this section : the false representation of - [ ... ] the character, amount, or legal status of any debt ''."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have requested every month since XX/XX/2018 that Experian and XXXX remove the public record information of the bankruptcy on my credit reports. Both of the credit reporting agencies have responded several times that they received information from the US Bankruptcy Court and the record is VERIFIED and ACCURATE. The attached documentation from the US Bankruptcy Court clearly states that they do not report or verify information with credit bureaus. They also state that agencies do not contact the court to verify bankruptcy filings. 

A credit reporting agency is required by law to the following : ( 1 ) Guidelines. The Bureau shall, with respect to persons or entities that are subject to the enforcement authority of the Bureau under section 621 ( A ) establish and maintain guidelines for use by each person that furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency regarding the accuracy and integrity of the information relating to consumers that such entities furnish to consumer reporting agencies, and update such guidelines as often as necessary ; and ( B ) prescribe regulations requiring each person that furnishes information to a consumer reporting agency to establish reasonable policies and procedures for implementing the guidelines established pursuant to subparagraph ( A ). 624 - 15 U.S.C. 1681s-3 97 ( 2 ) Criteria. In developing the guidelines required by paragraph ( 1 ) ( A ), the Bureau shall ( A ) identify patterns, practices, and specific forms of activity that can compromise the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies ; ( B ) review the methods ( including technological means ) used to furnish information relating to consumers to consumer reporting agencies ; ( C ) determine whether persons that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies maintain and enforce policies to ensure the accuracy and integrity of information furnished to consumer reporting agencies ; and ( D ) examine the policies and processes that persons that furnish information to consumer reporting agencies employ to conduct reinvestigations and correct inaccurate information relating to consumers that has been furnished to consumer reporting agencies. 

My results from these credit agencies now state that XXXX XXXX provided the information. Where did XXXX XXXX get this information if the bankruptcy court states that they do not verify the information with third party vendors or credit agencies. All information collected needs to be verified with the Bankruptcy court directly and must be detailed and accurate, if not they are in violation of my rights. I need these items to be removed immediately, as this organization has not followed, reasonable procedures. It is the purpose of this letter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, ACCURACY, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX  and Transunion are reporting an incorrect coding of the XXXX XXXX partial account number ****XXXX. This account is being coded as an M5 when actually this needs to be coded as an M1. ( Please see pages 6 and 7 of the attached credit report. ) This account reflects a {$0.00} balance and {$0.00} past due. This incorrect coding is harming my credit score and is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Please keep in mind that it is impossible to be late on accounts where nothing is owed and nothing is past due.
Student loan,"On XX/XX/2019, I received notification from XXXX XXXX that Nelnet had posted negative remarks on my credit report with XXXX which caused them to drop my credit score by 40 points. On XX/XX/XXXX, they did the same thing with XXXX with dropped my credit score by 43 points. The payments with Nelnet for my daughter 's federal student loans I applied for haven't even started yet and they're making trouble for me already. If they're pulling this XXXX now, what will they do if I really do something wrong? Nelnet has NO business reporting every little thing to XXXX, XXXX  or XXXX unless I do something serious like miss a payment or default on my loans."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I have reason to believe that my credit report has been affected by identity thieves.

I spoke with a manager by the name of XXXX who stated they are refusing to file a dispute regardless of the fact that I did not give permission for this inquiry.

They ignored my claim of XXXX full disclosure violations 1001.1101, and  insisted that I contact the merchant for the {$49.00} and declaring the dispute closed!!!! 

I then sent them the attached letter fully describing the situation and explaining that my dispute is now completely with Capital One for failing to represent my SPECIFIC claims properly to the merchant for response and resolution and for failing in enforcing my federal credit rights. 

I cut up my credit card and enclosed it in the envelop with the XX/XX/2018 letter and describing that I am leaving the {$49.00} charge unpaid because of Capital One illegal actions.

On XXXX-19 I tried again and received the same message although all of my information was correct. After trying at least 3 more times and receiving the same message, I called Equifax and spoke with a representative who was first of all hard to understand and was absolutely no help. I asked for a supervisor and after a while a lady who was also difficult to understand came to the phone by the name of XXXX. I told her the situation and once again provided my information. My information was correct, however, the supervisor told me as well as the online system showing ... could not process online. 
I told her that I received my credit reports from both XXXX and XXXX with the exact same information. All the lady told me was that I needed to request by mail and provide certain identifications before they could proceed. I am VERY angry at Equifax and found them to be extremely difficult and uncaring. Every time I mentioned the situation she would only ask me the same questions over and over again and exactly as she did in previous statements to me. 
I eventually hung up the phone as this lady/company seemed not to care about consumers. 
I need my credit report immediately as I believe that information on that credit report from Equifax is the reason I was turned down for a loan. There is nothing showing negatively on XXXX or XXXX. However, I believe the problem to be with Equifax although I do not believe that there should be anything negative on that report as there were no negatives on the other two. 
This situation is causing problems for me as I need a loan to proceed with my living situations. They claim that my information does not match the information they have on file ... however, I know my own personal information and what I provided is correct.

As a background, my loan originated XX/XX/XXXX and I have been paying a {$100.00} Escrow payment towards PMI. I do not currently have an impound account. Per my amortization schedule, the PMI is to remain static until I reach the 80 % debt to loan ratio. Also, as of XX/XX/XXXX my loan was transferred to a new servicer. 
I contacted the new servicer on several occasions to understand what the shortage payment is for and they weren't able to help me because they are saying they don't see any transaction history prior to XXXX. Two supervisors ( XXXX and XXXX ) requested the transaction history from the old servicer and haven't received the document. They are claiming they are just collecting this amount on behalf of the old servicer and have nothing to do with it. 
I've also been in contact with the old servicer and they are also saying they don't know why there is a shortage payment. No one is able to help me and this is my last resort to get this issue resolved. I have made my mortgage payments on time every month since the origination of my loan and I don't understand why there is a shortage payment and why I would be the one responsible for that when I pay what I owe every month. I am not in control of when and how much money goes in and out of the escrow account, and I shouldn't be punished for it. I feel I am being given the run around by both servicers.

The account number they provided me was XXXX ( will be provided later if needed ). The transfer was made for XXXX USD. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Transferwise confirms that the transfer has been completed.

I have received the following responses from Transferwise : Hello XXXX, Thanks for reaching out to us. 

I took a look at transfer # XXXX and can see that it was sent to the intermediary banks details that are shown on the document you've sent us. 

I have attached a transfer receipt to this email. Providing this receipt to the intermediary bank, and asking them to reject the funds, may help to get this money back to you. 

If the payment is rejected successfully, the funds would be sent back to us and we would notify you via email with the option to change the bank details of this transfer and send the payment out again, or, you'd be able to cancel the transfer and receive a refund. 

However, I'm also going to reach out to our payments team here to see what they would advise in this particular situation. We'll be following up with you via email as soon as we hear back from them. 

In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. We are always happy to help. 

Best wishes, XXXX TransferWise After that I have sent more queries and have not received answers. Anyway, I don't know where my money is. I have also tried to contact XXXX NY to no avail so far.

I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and asked them why they had changed the date of this late payment reporting and the rep I spoke with seemed very confused and could not give me a clear answer of why this happened. Then, I pulled my credit report again on XX/XX/XXXX and noticed XXXX XXXX had put back the 30 day late reporting on my credit report for XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX XXXX nor Experian ( the credit reporting agency this was reflected on ) ever sent me a notice once this negative item was reinserted back on my credit report. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Experian about this matter to see why they never sent me a notice once this late payment was put back onto my credit report and the rep with Experian also acted like he was confused and told me he did not know if it was XXXX XXXX or Experian who initiated this removal and reinsertion of the late payment on my credit report. The Experian rep also claimed he could not actually see where the late payment had been removed and then put back onto my credit report. I feel the reason everyone with XXXX XXXX and Experian are acting confused is because no one wants to take responsibility to fix this issue. As a result of the XX/XX/XXXX late payment being removed from my credit report, I want it removed again and this time permanently. 

Another issue I have with XXXX XXXX is that I wrote them two letters disputing the late payments they have reported on my credit report for the months of XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and they just want to keep being stubborn and refuse to remove the negative items or show me proof that my payments were actually late for those months and I requested that they send me proof in my letters to them and they just continue sending me their same generic letter saying they will not remove the items since their records show it is reporting correctly. And their most recent letter does not even address all the months of late payments I disputed with them, but they only mentioned how they corrected the error they made when they showed my account late for XXXX. They say they must report everything accurately according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but yet due to all of the mistakes they have made, that is not what they are doing and I am sure they have probably done this to others as well. 

The reason I am disputing all of the late payments they reported on my credit report is that when I review my payment history on the XXXX XXXX website, it clearly shows my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and this is also what XXXX XXXX told me many times over the phone. And when I review my payment history, I can see where I have been late maybe 10 days or so, but some of the months they reported me as being 30 days late, do not appear to actually be 30 days late based on my payment dates compared with their established due date. For example, I made two payments in XXXX ( on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ), but they reported me as 30 days late for that month and the previous month, I made my payment on XX/XX/XXXX. When I called a representative with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to have them explain this, they just tell me to file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told them I already did that and they rejected my claim saying the late payments were accurate and since that doesn't make sense to me based on what I see, I am calling them to get an explanation. I spoke with a supervisor with XXXX XXXX who had a very nasty attitude and kept telling me that she is not a credit specialist and that I should just file a dispute with the credit bureaus. I told her I don't expect her to be a credit specialist, but I do expect her as a supervisor with this credit card company to explain my payment history and why they may be reporting it as late. 

Then the XXXX XXXX supervisor starts telling me how they go by the billing cycle when determining if payments are late and I told her this is the first time I was hearing this and every other time I called, I was told that my payment due date is on the XXXX of each month and that is also what is shows on their website. It just seems they want to justify themselves refusing to make this right. I will upload my supporting documentation to this complaint showing my payment history with XXXX XXXX, my dispute letters to them and their responses. I would also like Experian to be investigated for their part in the way the issue was handled with the late payment for XX/XX/XXXX being removed and then placed back onto my credit report."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was shopping for a pre-owned vehicle with a reputable dealership not too long ago and was denied a loan because although 2 of the big three credit reporting agencies had my scores in line with what I expected, this dealership chose to send my credit application to XXXX Bank who uses a company call XXXX XXXX for its credit reporting. My score is completely low with this small agency and I have never heard of them nor have I given them my consent to investigate my background. 

I had to put a stop with Ally to ever accepting a credit application with my name on it simply because this little company was dragging me down. In terms of how they obtained my score and where this information came from, I have called and written time and time again, to no avail. 

Please stop this, what I see to be, a fraudulent company from continuing to being allowed to partner to large banks.

Vehicle loan or lease,"On XX/XX/XXXX my XXXX XXXX was involved in a total loss accident. XXXX insurance paid out the claim of approximately {$4500.00} more than the value of the vehicle. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Capital One to inquire as to why I had not received salvaged title and the amount that was over and above what was owed on the car. The rep.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Failure to receive a credit report as advertised On a website called XXXX there is suppose to be a way a consumer can get a credit report from each of the three credit bureaus once each year. I went to the site this morning with the goal of getting my three reports one from each reporting agency. In the process of following the promts I receive a file from XXXX and XXXX   that was what I expected. They both were PDF files with the information that I requested. 
The Problem was with Experian. I got a print file option, I ask for the file to be Print to File, the file that was sent to my computer was sent to Note Pad and totally unreadable. There was no option to get any other format. I tried to call Experian using the phone number provided on their website XXXX. This was also a problem because there were only two options provided 1 or 2. Neither option provided a way to talk wiith someone about my issue. 
I am writing this complaint because Experian has not provided me a copy of my credit report and I want to receive a copy. If they are not going to provide a copy through the XXXX XXXX website they should remove their business. Other wise it is being falsely advertised. 
I am especially concerned because last year I ran into a problem with Experian not providing me access to my credit report through their online system. I also found out through happenstance that they had frozen my account without any notice to me. I spent valuable time going through your agency attempting to get those issues resolved. I would like to know how is it that they seem to be unethical and continue to have a license to operate."

Listen, time has passed and it still hasnt be removed and I been instructed to check the policy on online that stated that they would remove it. When should I expect this to be removed? When do you report to the credit bureau? Please kindly escalate this issue immediately up to the chain to ensure this is remove within the next 24-48hrs as its hindered my chance to buy or rent a house for my family.

A supervisor came on the line and asked me a couple of questions and said i was approved for forbearance without a first payment since i am not completely 30 days past due. I also asked if this call was recorded and she said yes. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX reported me late and in my previous complaint i stated this and XXXX XXXX denied saying approval of forbearance.

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I closed escrow on my property ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Az. ). The prior owner was in foreclosure, however funds from the sale of he property satisfying his outstanding principal balance were wired to his mortgage company ( Lakeview Loan Servicing ). 

Lakeview failed to advise the local trustee that the debt was satisfied, and the trustee subsequently executed a trustees sale. This act of foreclosure was taken against me even though I did not and had not owed a debt on the property that had defaulted. 

In XXXX of XXXX I was served with eviction orders by the third party who purchased MY property at trustees sale for about $ 170k. I was forced to engage counsel and defend my right to occupy the property I had purchased fair and square. At that time, I was forced to file a prior CFPB  complaint in order to get someone from Lakeview to respond to my many inquiries. A compliance manager from Lakeview reached out to me, and for a short time it seemed like the mortgage company would be working to resolve an obvious error on their part. 

Fast forwarding to XXXX of XXXX, I am still in danger of being evicted from a property I purchased fairly because Lakeview Loan Servicing has been and continues to be incapable of giving the matter any reasonable attention. 

All I want is for Lakeview to PAY ATTENTION to my issue. I want them to work with the third party who purchased the property at the improperly executed foreclosure sale in XXXX, and get my name and my family out of the way of eviction proceedings.

Vehicle loan or lease,"Below is a summary of events involving our account, detailing how Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation ( NMAC ) failed to timely invoice our account for amounts owed, resulting in avoidable late fees / charges from a third party, as well as duplicative and excess charges from NMAC. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, my wife and I drove our leased vehicle through Texas, incurring tolls of {$15.00}. The XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) subsequently mailed a bill for that amount to the XXXX. XXXX address of NMAC, on XX/XX/XXXX. Neither my wife nor I received a bill from NMAC, on our billing statements or separately, for this amount. On XX/XX/XXXX, the XXXX sent a Notice of Nonpayment to NMAC at the same XXXX XXXX address ; for the original amount owed of {$15.00} plus a {$10.00} administrative fee. The amount owed on this notice was invoiced to our account four months later, on our statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. NMAC added a {$2.00} administrative charge to that bill for a total of {$27.00}, which was promptly paid on XX/XX/XXXX. In addition to adding the amount to our statement, NMAC mailed us a letter notifying us of the reason for the charge and included a copy of the Notice of XXXX. 

In reference to case / reference # XXXX, I am disputing all amounts paid on the referenced account in relation to charges from the XXXX above {$15.00}, and request an immediate refund, on the following basis : The XXXX mailed to NMAC a billing statement for {$15.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. NMAC failed to take timely action to pay the bill in full prior to the due date. In addition, NMAC failed to notify me or my wife of the original charge, preventing us from settling the amount in a timely manner. When NMAC did notify us of the charge, they only did so after late fees had been imposed and well after the original due date. NMACs negligence not only resulted in late fees / charges and wasted time for me and my wife to resolve this matter, but also put us in legal limbo with the XXXX. An unpaid traffic citation could have resulted in additional fines / penalties if either of us had been in the state of Texas, as well as other legal ramifications. This is a matter that XXXX must take seriously not only for the financial protection of consumers, but also because of the legal implications. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, NMAC sent my wife and me a second letter notifying us of a traffic citation from the XXXX. The letter included a Third Notice of Nonpayment from the XXXX, with an amount due of {$50.00}, comprised of the original charge of {$15.00}, the {$10.00} fee from the original Notice of Nonpayment, and an additional {$25.00} fee. This amount has also been added to our account billing statements. Not only was this strange because I believed I had settled the matter when we paid {$27.00} in XX/XX/XXXX, but it was also strange that this was the third Notice of Nonpayment from the XXXX ; yet it was only the second piece of correspondence that had been forwarded to us by NMAC. 

On investigation, I found that the XXXX had mailed a Second Notice of Nonpayment, for an amount owed of {$50.00}, on XX/XX/XXXX, to NMAC at the same XXXX XXXX address as the previous two notices. This notice was never forwarded to my wife nor me by NMAC, nor was the amount owed added to our billing statements. I then found that the Third Notice of Nonpayment, which my wife and I were forwarded along with the letter from NMAC on XX/XX/XXXX, was actually provided by the XXXX to NMAC on XX/XX/XXXX, again four months before it was forwarded to me for payment. I found this information, as well as the information related to the original bill and the original Notice of Nonpayment, by contacting the XXXX directly on XX/XX/XXXX. I also learned, from contacting the XXXX, no further amounts are owed in relation to the toll or any associated citations / fees after XX/XX/XXXX, the date that NMAC sent a check to the XXXX for the amount of {$27.00}. 

In relation to reference / case # XXXX, I am disputing the full amount of {$50.00}, and for the record I will not be paying this amount as long as it shows as due on our account, for the following reasons : as the attachments A, B, D, and E clearly show, the charge of {$50.00} is in relation to the same charges referenced above which were paid promptly by me on XX/XX/XXXX, after I was notified of the charge by NMAC. NMACs failure to promptly notify me of the charges and take appropriate action to prevent late fees / additional charges prior to that date is not my responsibility, and stems back to NMACs egregious failure to notify me of the original amount owed of {$15.00} back in XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, the XXXX recognizes the amount of {$27.00} paid by check on XX/XX/XXXX and does not show any further amounts owed. For NMAC to collect an additional charge from me of {$50.00}, multiplying amounts already paid, for the supposed purpose of paying amounts that are in fact not owed, is plain thievery. 

It is needless to say that I am extremely disappointed in NMAC for the clear negligence and failure to act responsibly in this case. I contacted NMAC by telephone twice on XX/XX/XXXX in an attempt to dispute these charges and resolve the matter. In the first instance, the NMAC representative was combative and refused to assist in the situation other than a vague commitment to an investigation ; furthermore, the representative would not commit to taking the same steps that I took today in contacting the XXXX directly to determine the root cause of the charges and follow the trail of correspondence and payments. The second representative was helpful, providing me with the case numbers and assuring me that she was escalating a complaint on my behalf."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","XXXX XXXX and Transunion are damaging my credit with false information. Even though I have detailed the situation to them XXXX times, they have chosen to ignore me. 

In XXXX I had a XXXX  service. XXXX of my drivers wanted to own his own vehicle. I guaranteed a loan for him from XXXX. Months later, without my permission or knowledge, the driver turned the vehicle back to XXXX, and XXXX accepted it without my signature even though I had an economic interest in it. The first I heard about the situation was when XXXX sent me a letter demanding payment for the loss they incurred in resale of the vehicle. I was never given the opportunity to possess the vehicle and take over the loan obligation. Had XXXX advised me of the situation, I would have simply added the vehicle to my fleet, leased it to another driver and continued making the loan payments. 

Nevertheless, the credit reports from these XXXX companies state that I defaulted on the loan to XXXX, thus substantially damaging me. Obviously, these companies have not acceptably investigated or considered the matter. Please help me!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"XX/XX/19 - Tried to obtain the balance and transaction history on the website XXXX of two different prepaid Visa cards given from an employer, one of which had no balance but also no transaction history. The company was phoned and they advised they were unable to assist without the original load amount, which this information is not available due to the length of time past since the card was given ( over 12 months ).

After this I contact US Bank as the cards are backed by them, they transferred me to their internal gift card automated line. They card number did not register and I called the customer service line again. I was informed that if I went to a branch with ID that I would be able to obtain the information.

I then went to a US Bank branch and an employer tried to assist by contacting the card company again, but was given similar information. Though she was advised that the card did not actually have a XXXX balance and that the card was not activated correctly. 

After this the employer was contacted and advised that the cards are paid for in cash and that no history is kept of the purchases, meaning that they could not provide the original card amount. 

It seems unethical that the company will not provide information for an alternative way to verify the account history even when speaking with a bank representative."
Checking or savings account,"I ordered a 15 inch XXXX XXXX XXXX  Laptop from XXXX using my Chase Debit card for a total of {$2900.00} on XX/XX/2019. The package was supposedly shipped out via XXXX and allegedly "" delivered '' to my house on XX/XX/2019. I was home the entire day waiting for the package but no one ever showed up to deliver it and I did not receive the box. After waiting 2 days in the case that XXXX delayed the delivery, the laptop still did not arrive. So I contacted XXXX, the merchant, to see if they can contact XXXX to try and locate my package if it went missing or something. One of the agents from XXXX told me that XXXX will start an investigation to try and locate the package. After a month and a half of "" investigating '' and constant calls with both XXXX and XXXX and continuous times of XXXX telling me they would refund me the payment but never did, I could no longer wait for my money back speaking with them. I called my Chase bank number on the back of my debit card and disputed the transaction on XX/XX/2019. I gave them all the information they asked for and was issued a temporary credit for the disputed charges. I was given no updates on the status of the dispute, but was given my money back. At that point, because I had my money, I assumed that the disputed charges resulted in my favor. But today, on XX/XX/2019, I received a letter in the mail dated XX/XX/2019, that Chase bank has found based on their "" research '' that the disputed transaction of {$2900.00} was "" processed correctly or was authorized '' and will be removing {$2900.00} from my account on XX/XX/2019. Upon contacting Chase again, they told me that they will not be reviewing my claim or take a second look at it. I will lose {$2900.00} and still will not have the XXXX XXXX XXXX laptop I ordered on XX/XX/2019. At this point, I will not have the funds to pay for my monthly expenses because I will be short almost {$3000.00} with 4 days notice."
Checking or savings account,"A week prior to XX/XX/XXXX I went into XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask if they can fix my son 's computer to play video games on it. I specifically said for games such as XXXX and XXXX. The clerk said yes and left it with him. On XX/XX/XXXX received a call stating it was ready and paid the {$420.00}. XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX same clerk who repaired it was on the phone with us walking us thru how to fix it since XXXX   nor XXXX  could not load on computer. We followed the clerk 's instructions on how to fix it via some instructions he found on XXXX and after 2 days it still did not work. XX/XX/XXXX, I went into XXXX   XXXX XXXX asking for a refund and they refused. I gave their merchandise back ( have pics to support this ) and stated I will dispute thru my bank ( us bank ). I called in to dispute the charge and US Bank filed it as fraudulent as I later found out. I specifically explained to US Bank that we are filing a dispute for not receiving the product/service. We were told by US Bank we would receive paperwork in the mail to further explain our dispute and any supporting evidence. We received the refund in about a week. We didn't receive any paperwork as described so we called in. US Bank kept transferring us from dept to dept and stated that they had to refile our dispute. Again we stated we are filing a dispute based on not receiving a product/service. Again, they filed it as fraud as we found out later. A month later we receive a notice stating that after their investigation they didn't discover any fraud as the transaction was done by pin and US Bank withdrew the {$420.00} from my account. I called in again and found out the 2 disputes filed were fraud when I never stated it was fraud. US Bank stated they would refile the claim again. US Bank explained the funds would go back into my account in about a week however the funds never appeared. Multiple calls were made week after week asking when the money would be returned to my account and no one could give an answer. Multiple times as I was on hold for over an hour and transferred from dept to dept as no one could give me a solid answer. Finally, got a hold of someone and they stated based on the type of transaction that was done ( by pin ) it was not fraud. Again i explained I never once said it was fraud I am disputing the fact that I didn't receive my product/service. US Bank stated because 60 days had gone by at this point there's nothing they could do for me as it was too late to file a dispute and to seek legal advice. This claim was handled incorrectly for 60 days and then US Bank covers themselves by stating it's too late to dispute it at this point. This is unfair and I deserve my {$420.00} back for not getting the product/service I paid for. I barely found out about cfpb or I would have filed this a long time ago."

They sent me a letter stating that they will not honor my XXXX for XXXX because it is in the United States. I will not be on these orders forever. Once I complete these orders, I will be back unemployed and won't be able to make my payments. I have attached all documents as proof."
Debt collection,"I received a letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/2019 concerning a balance owing with Access Group Inc . 

This debt was previously placed with XXXX and I never received any notification that XXXX is no longer servicing the account. I have tried to reach out to XXXX and they are no longer taking calls. 

On XX/XX/2019 I spoke with XXXX XXXX with XXXX and after all disclosures I told him that I wanted to start making payments but would need some written documentation confirming that they are in fact the servicer of the loan, that the account is no longer placed with XXXX and that XXXX XXXX has given them permission to service the loan. 

My request was met with significant pushback from Mr. XXXX. He told me that the letter I received - the Dunning letter - was verification enough and that I should call Access Group. I explained to him that I am well aware of my rights and I am entitled to have this debt verified and have proof that they have authority to service this debt. XXXX started to interrupt me as I was talking and told me that he is in the position to know far more about what his job is than me. I told him that I don't appreciate his tone or that he is being argumentative with is request and asked to speak with his manager. I was told that that the manager - XXXX XXXX is unavailable. 

My complaint is two fold, the abusive and argumentative nature of Mr. XXXX is unacceptable. I have a debt, but I am still human and should be treated as such. Second, receiving push back for requesting proof that XXXX has authority to service the debt from Access Group is in direct  violation of the FDCPA."

This is in direct contradiction of the statement in XXXX XXXX letter : "" Should the merchant provide documentation to support their claim, we will contact you at that time to discuss the details of their response. '' As we are the direct witness of the Merchant misrepresentation, any falsified documents or statements from the Merchant in this dispute can be easily uncovered by us. All it needs to take place is for the Citi investigator to communicate with us during the dispute, just as XXXX XXXX stated. The promise from Citi executive team is nice, but it seems that it doesn't translate into actions for its investigators. 

Based on our experience, Citibank has many good people working hard to do the right things for its cardholders. But its investigation team appears to have the culture of ignoring or presuming guilty on claimants. They make the Citi slogan "" Citi is with you before, during, and after every purchase '' a bad joke."

Debt collection,"In XXXX and XX/XX/2019 I began receiving notifications from credit monitoring service that a collection agency Contract Callers Inc., had added a negative account to my credit file. This was for a XXXX phone account claiming I owed over {$1300.00}. 

On XX/XX/2019 I contacted Contract Callers via phone @ XXXX. I informed the person that my debt with XXXX had been canceled. I was calling to ask that they remove this negative information from my credit file. 

The person I spoke with stated they would accept payment. She also stated she was representing XXXX and suggested if I had any issues or concerns that I call XXXX. 

I informed her that they were about the 2nd or 3rd collection agency that had attempted to collect this debt. Both of the other companies deleted the debt because there was no valid contract. 

I asked for validation of the debt since they were claiming to represent XXXX. She said if I had any issues, I should contact XXXX. I informed her that I would be filing disputes with the credit agencies and they needed to show a contract existed and verification of the debt. I then hung up very upset after this call. 

I filed the dispute days later stating the debt was cancelled with the original creditor, NO Contract and because this was a cell phone bill, the federal statue of limitations of 2 years has been reached ( This claimed contract would be approximately 4-5 years old ). Contract Callers returned a response today with XXXX stating the debt was valid and this debt remains on my credit file. I also filed the same dispute with the other 2 major credit reporting agencies. 

Contract Caller 's has not provided any contract or validation. They also have falsely stated this debt is valid. This appears to be their tactic with consumers to try and force them to pay these collection debts that they have procured. As a consumer, we are left helpless to these unscrupulous practices. They currently have over 150 complaints filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. As a consumer, I am asking for your assistance in getting this "" collection agency '' to accurately validate and report debt to the credit reporting agencies or no longer be allowed to practice as a business with access to consumers credit files."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I contacted Equifax on XX/XX/2019 at XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX due to an unauthorized address change in my credit report for your bureau only. After going through the authentication process and approved, I found out that a lender had changed my address in my personal information. When asked what lender changed my address, XXXX informed me that she did not have that information. I also questioned how a lender can just change my personal information without going through a process such as I did and how a lender could change my personal information. I was also informed that she did not have that information. I was then informed that I have to write a letter, make copies of more of my personal information and send it in to get my address changed back to the place that I have lived for 10 years when I did not authorize the change in the first place. The credit bureau never contacted me. I only found this out because I have XXXX XXXX protection services. 

I feel it is a violation to allow any company or other individual to change my address without personally contacting me first and for it to be extremely difficult to correct my own information. I really do not understand how this is acceptable. I sent a letter to Equifax about the issue and sent the documentation I had. I also question how a lender can have a copy of my drivers license and my social security card to change my address. I attached the letter I sent to the company below."

Later, another letter was sent to my house, this time from GC services, a collection agency. As I no longer live in the country, I was very surprised to find out a XXXX account was made in my name. In total I received two letters from XXXX. XXXX had no account information and the other did not include a date. This to me seemed very unprofessional and I thought it was a scam.

Debt collection,"My wife and I are in the process of buying a home and when doing a credit check for a Mortgage we were denied. The representative then referred us to a credit advisor who told us much to our surprise that the biggest thing holding us back was a {$120.00} XXXX ( the cell phone co. ) bill now in collections. I say surprise because when we left XXXX in early 2017 we thought everything was settled, we even had verbal confirmation from one of their store reps that everything was up to date and good. This apparently was not the case. Not only did we have no idea of this debt, we did not receive any information from XXXX or a collections agency. Honestly if it wasnt for the advisor we probably would have never known how damaging this was to my credit. With all that being said I do want to make good on my debts. So I contacted XXXX and told them I want to get them off my credit report and to give me the figure to make them disappear, which was the amount said earlier. XXXX told me if payed in full that it would be deleted from my credit report. I was then told by XXXX to contact the collections agency handling this case. While discussing this issue with the collections rep I was told that it would not be deleted, that the best they could do is report the debt as been paid in full. Something about that just did sit well on my mind. So without paying I called my credit advisor to tell them this scenario. They said with us not even knowing about this debt, not receiving any information from collections, and the denial of deleting this from my credit report, to file a complaint and dispute this case. Which is where Im at now. I am willing to pay any and all debts I owe, but under these circumstances I dont believe this particular debt should be on my report."
Student loan,"Over 3 years ago I applied for the PSLF program. I filled out all the paperwork and my employer signed verification forms. I was told I qualified and my loans then had to be transferred over to Fed Loan Servicing from XXXX. I didnt think there was anything wrong, as every time I called customer service, they verified my loans were on the PSLF.  Each year I would have to fill out the paperwork and as I made more each year, my payments kept going up. About 3 months ago, on a random customer service phone call, I find out my loans were never put on the PSLF program and they lied and said they never had my paperwork when I applied over 3 years ago. I was told by numerous customer service people that I would need to reapply and have my employer verify my employment and they could back track all the years I qualified. I recently got approved and my current employer of 3 years has qualified and they are telling me only 1 payment has qualified so far. I have had so many past issues with this company and now this. I was told there was no one I could file a complaint with. Im writing this now as I just read the news how the teachers are suing this company for misleading information and many issues I have been through. I would really like to take action against this company, as this is wrong to be untruthful and unlawful to its customers."
Checking or savings account,"HSBC Bait and Switch Operations This spring I received in the mail a solicitation from HSBC Bank to open an account online called an Advance Checking account. I called the information number on the solicitation to ask some questions I had. At that time I was also encouraged to open a Direct Savings account online that paid 2.3 % interest using the bulk of the money I initially put into Advance Checking. 

I went online in XX/XX/XXXX using the code number for a bonus that came with the mail solicitation. After providing all the requested information on the designated HSBC website, it rejected the application. An auto-generated email to me said my identity couldn't be verified. I had provided my valid New York State Driver 's License information and my own phone number, address, SSN, etc.

I called their phone numbers for help, and after much time on the phone I was advised to try again. They could not tell me what exactly the problem was. I was also advised over the phone that after opening the account, I could open the online Direct Savings account paying 2.3 % interest and transfer most of the money to that account.

After another failed attempt to open the account online, with the same result, I called back and was advised to go to a branch to open the account. This I did. I went to the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ) and presented the coupon that came in the mail, which the bank officer took. At the branch, I was advised by the bank officer that they had a 5-month 2.3 % CD I could shift most of the money into once I funded the Advance Checking account. This was at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. 

A few days later I sent {$10000.00} to my new HSBC account ( # XXXX ) by ACH transfer from another bank. I then went back online to open the 2.3 % online savings account. After completing the application, it was refused. Once again, the emailed reason was could not verify identity- even though I now had an account at HSBC . 

I called their "" help '' number, was given another number to call, and after taking my information and supposedly doing something to fix the issue, this person said to try again in 24 hours. I did that, and once again was refused- "" unable to verify identity. '' I emailed the branch officer who opened the Advance Checking account and asked if she could do a transfer into the CD we'd discussed. She did not reply. Instead another officer responded, I presume the branch manager, and said it had to be new funds, which of course was NOT what the first officer had said. Then I asked if they could open the 2.3 % savings account, and was told No, that's online only. 

As the bank had my verified identity in its possession after I had opened the Advance Checking account, it was invalid to refuse to allow me to open the Direct Savings account on grounds of non-verification of identity. I am entitled to interest from the date I attempted to open the account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

As of now, this is the response from HSBC : I raised two issues in my complaint against HSBC Bank. One issue was completely ignored by HSBC bank in its response, and remains unaddressed, and the other issue was responded to with false information and misdirection. 

There was no explanation or even a reference to why HSBC blocked me from opening the online Direct Savings account with the automated claim "" could not verify identity '' even AFTER I ALREADY HAD AN ACCOUNT with the bank! Their "" customer service '' dept. just said try again in 24 hours, after supposedly making a fix. Same thing happened. This account was offered as a teaser over the phone to induce me to open the checking account. To avoid fees I have to lock up {$10000.00} for 6 months. 

As to the matter of the CD offered at the branch, I did NOT request it on XX/XX/XXXX, but on XX/XX/XXXX, as my dated email proves. And this business of missing an imaginary deadline of XX/XX/XXXX by a day for the money I had on deposit to be considered "" new '' is spurious. No officer at the branch said anything about a deadline. And the only mention of "" new '' money came later from the branch manager, who emailed that "" new '' money was required for a CD. Again,  nothing about missing an imaginary "" deadline. '' I did some online research on HSBC and was shocked to discover a history of major criminality, as described in the following government announcements and news accounts : "" HSBC Holdings Plc. and HSBC Bank USA N.A.

Student loan,"Over the past 4 months I have attempted to enter into an income based repayment plan through Navient Student Loans. Every month ( and sometimes a couple of times a month ) since XX/XX/2019 I have called in attempting to resolve this. I have received different answers on every call and misinformation that has led me to have to continue to put my loan in forbearance for the past 5 months so they can fix the situation on their end. Every month I have provided up to date pay stub information, and every month am asked to do it again so they can calculate my IBR correctly. I have finally been told that my monthly payment will include any overtime I've received over the past year, regardless if I am able to receive overtime over this following year. I can not believe a federal student loan provider would calculate payment information based on variable pay ; that is grossly irresponsible. So based on business needs, if my business does not have the budget to allow over time this year, I am still responsible for the additional payment amounts to Navient. This company is absolutely appalling to work with and is the reason student loan debt is such a massive issue ; STUDENTS STEER CLEAR, DO NOT GET LOANS FROM NAVIENT."

After filling the receivers information, I clicked the send button as I usually do, but this time it took me to an error page asking me to call a number to complete the transfer, so I thought there mighthave been something wrong with the information, therefore I reattempted to send money a second then a third time, both of which lead to the same error screen, thus I decided to use another online service to transfer money instead. 

Althoughthe transfer attempts have beenlabeled erroneous by MoneyGram ( I can supply you with screenshots from the webpage ), I was surprised to receive a notification from my bank onXX/XX/2019 that my checking account has reached zero causing an overdraft protection transfer from my savings along with applicable fees. I looked up my checking accountand was astonished to find that MoneyGram has charged me {$3000.00}, corresponding to 3 transfers in the amount of {$1000.00} each along with their transfer fees ( {$25.00} each ). I contacted MoneyGram who claimed they never took themoney and said it's a standard procedure for them to have the bank issue authorizations for requested transfers, but stated that this does not happen unless the transfers went through. 

I disputed the authorizations with my bank onXX/XX/2019, who promised to investigate this and refund the money in a maximum of 10 business days. MoneyGram, on the other hand, stated that the money should be back by end of business on XX/XX/2019, nevertheless the money has not been refundedas of today XX/XX/2019, and to make things worse these authorizations have been converted to posted transactions now. 

I spoke to MoneyGram 3 times so far, once on XX/XX/2019, again on XX/XX/2019 and a third time on XX/XX/2019 and every time they either say something close to : "" the money should return very soon '', "" your bank initiated the authorization and you should contact them '', or "" we will investigate this and it will take 72 hours ''. 

I have been in a financial deficit of XXXX {$3000.00} from XX/XX/2019 to present time because of the repeated failings of MoneyGram to refund my money which they illegally took from my bank account for erroneous attempts of money transfer. Even if this was the result of a system error, the fact that they continue to handle it very bureaucratically with repeated deferrals of action and no regard to the sustained financial damages is extremely appalling. 

I am not sure if punitive damages can be pursued in this case because the company really snatched {$3000.00} from my account for no reason whatsoeverand repeatedly failed to initiate an immediate refund for almost 2 weeks.

It is negatively affecting my credit reports - I just received an alert from XXXX. This just can't be right. Add to this situation that my wife and I subsidize my mother in law 's expenses about 80 % per month - she only receives {$660.00} in XXXX   per month. Living in XXXX  is a lot more expensive than {$660.00} per month. My wife and I have only been receiving UI benefits all this time - those benefits pale in comparison to our monthly income when real estate is open and thriving."
Debt collection,"Hello, We previously had a credit card with Capital One in my wife 's name, 'XXXX   '. We had some difficulty and fell behind, then the account went to collections. We received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX offering a settlement on behalf of Capital One for account ending in XXXX ( Ref # XXXX ). The original amount of debt is {$1900.00}, but they were offering a settlement in the amount of {$990.00} in 12 monthly payments of {$82.00}. We started making payments in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then we have made three payments and the fourth is currently in the mail. The letter stated at the end of this process they were going to provide a letter stating our debt has been resolved. We have not received any other communication from either XXXX XXXX XXXX or Capital One since we started making payments. 

On XX/XX/XXXX we received a summons from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of Capital One ( File # XXXX ). The Summons and Complaint is seeking the full {$1900.00} minus {$82.00}. Now we are confused. We have been making payments and the checks have been getting cashed or cleared for three months. The fourth payment is in the mail. Suddenly, we receive this summons. There is definitely something deceptive or unfair about this process, either from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or Capital One. 

XXXX we tried to call Capital One, but was routed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and spoke to a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX, 'XXXX ' on XX/XX/XXXX around XXXX for File number XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) . We explained our situation and he said he could not provide any legal advice. We let 'XXXX ' know we would like to submit a complaint about this process and the treatment we are receiving. We also asked if maybe a complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may be warranted as well, but 'XXXX ' could not give us any guidance on that. He said he would route our complaint to Capital One right away and he would get back to us on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. He did not call so I tried to contact his office, but was placed on hold and then to a voicemail. I left a message and then went to the CFPB site to file this complaint. 

As a follow up to this, we are submitting our letter as well as a screen capture of the checks in the amount of {$82.00} being cleared by our bank. 

Ideally, we would like this summons and complaint to be cleared, and we would like to continue on the agreement and terms we are currently executing or the debt to be cleared by Capital One. Thank you."

They said If I make a voluntary payment by mail which will renew the account making it possible for them to pursue collection through the courts. 
2nd call Friday XX/XX/2019 XXXX said the principle balance is {$460.00} ( total balance is {$770.00} ) and therefore not eligible for a XXXX form. They would not let allow me to settle the account. They said the account is past the statute of limitations. 
Monday XX/XX/2019 The operator said that they do not know if a XXXX will be sent to me and that even if it is the charge will not be removed from my credit. I demanded the for or removal and the operator said they do not do removals and if any payment are made it would be voluntary on my part. This would then make the account active and allow them to take me to court. I asked for a supervisor and one was not available."

This started back in XX/XX/2019 continual communications with customer service by phone with always they were going to look in to it and get back with me but it never happened.

Per FCRA, I should have been notified that they were attempting to collect a debt. Midwest Recovery did not provide a dunning letter nor any written correspondence to that end, ever notifying me of this alleged debt thus, forfeiting my consumer right to dispute the validity of this alleged debt. I have never heard of this company, never communicated with them, nor have I ever signed any contract with them. This erroneous, unverifiable entry must be removed from my report immediately due to the FCRA violation. See attached credit reports that reflect the recency of this entry on my credit reports.

Checking or savings account,"Company : HSBC I responded to mail promotion from HSBC ( copy attached ) promising a {$370.00} welcome deposit for opening a checking account, depositing {$10000.00} in the first 30 days, and maintaining that amount for 90 days. The mailing promised that I would automatically receive the welcome deposit approximately 8 weeks after the 90-day period. 

Timeline : - XX/XX/2019 : Account opened and funded with {$10000.00}. 
- XX/XX/2019 : 90-day period elapses ( balance throughout this period = {$10000.00} ). 
- XX/XX/2019 : This is now 8 weeks after XX/XX/2019 so I expect to receive the {$370.00} welcome deposit shortly. 
- XX/XX/2019 : I first try to contact HSBC at XXXX but am on hold for over 20 minutes  and hang up. 
- XX/XX/2019 : I again call HSBC and speak with someone who confirms I have met the offer conditions and says she will get back to me within 48 hours to advise on when I will receive the {$370.00} welcome deposit - XX/XX/2019 : There has been no follow up from HSBC so I call again and speak with a different person who explains that he will need to submit another inquiry with the marketing team and will call me back no later than the following Monday ( XX/XX/2019 ).  Since the person I am speaking with says he has no authority to resolve my issue, I ask to speak with a manager or directly with someone from the marketing team, but am told that is not possible. 
- XX/XX/2019 : Six days later, there has been no follow up from HSBC so I call again. Again I am told that the person I am speaking has no authority to resolve my issue and they will need to submit another inquiry with the marketing team. They can not provide any timeframe for when to expect the issue to be resolved so I tell them that I have not received the welcome deposit I am owed within two days, I will have to file a complaint with the CFPB and the California banking regulator. 
- XX/XX/2019 : I have still not received the funds I am owed or any follow up from HSBC so I am submitting this complaint. 

There are numerous other complaints on the CFPB website regarding similar facts so clearly HSBC is engaging in a pattern of behavior -- promising welcome bonuses for opening accounts and then failing to carry through with their promises. In my case, the bank has had ample notice of the issue and time to respond. Their ongoing failure to correct the error amounts to an intentional act to harm a US consumer."

I requested for a copy of the report since the amount that Select Portfolio Servicing was requesting for was over $  755,000.which that value shows several discrepancies considering the property value is only {$450000.00}.

Which is completely false my property is not XXXX units, which I provided supporting documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX RECORDS AND A LICENSED APPRAISAL REPORT.

They basically state that by not reporting the entire account number, they are not reporting 100 % accurate information as required by section 609 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I contacted XXXX because I was turned down for an apartment because my credit report had conflicting information concerning my age on XX/XX/XXXX. I requested that my age be updated. I was born in XXXX  however my age is listed on the report as XXXX  yrs old. I received a decision in the mail on XX/XX/2019 stating that the investigation was updated to show my year of birth as XXXX and my age was XXXX. Called on XX/XX/2019, explained the situation, the representative apologized and stated that my age will no longer show on my report only my date of birth of XXXX.Received another letter stating that investigation was complete and my age is XXXX years old onXX/XX/2019Called again the explain the situation, this tie asked to speak to a supervisor and was told that ‘‘tis issue would be updated. Today is XXXX XXXX and I am not confident that this issue has been resolved, mean while the apartment complex is waiting for the updated information as they could not identify me based on conflicting ages/ year Born on my credit report and the apartment complex stated that they never seen anything like this before and that that was the only thing stopping me from getting the apartment."
Checking or savings account,"The complaint is against JPMorgan Chase Bank I opened a tenant landlord escrow account on XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent the funds to the unclaimed property state remittance and never notified me. Chase had been sending letters to the tenants to claim the deposit money, but she never did. She could have just claimed the money and took the security while she was still living there, which would have left me without a security deposit. How is this legal? How is the bank operating under these terms and landlords continue to put their money there? When I inquired I was told the letters were sent to the tenant because of inactivity. I, the escrow agent ( landlord ), never received notification and neither did I see anything on the my statements. The money now needs to be returned to the tenant because she has left the apartment. Chase put me in liability because I have the right to deduct the deposit for damages to my property or nonpayment of rent. After all these years with Chase I am terribly upset and concern about the financial damages and liabilities they have caused myself and the tenant. First, from accounts at other banks that I have spoke to they have not mentioned that money would be sent to unclaimed properties in that short of a time frame and the bank would notify me both online and through the mail. Chase did not. Under Illinois law ULC Uniform Act ( RUUPA ) under Treasurer XXXX there are changes in XX/XX/XXXX which my account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. I did not received notification of the changes and the law required email contact. I have used online banking and have had an email on my profile. In addition, I visit different chase branches and no mentioned of that law or my accounts. I hope others will learn from my experience and will tell other landlords and realtors of what Chase is doing. When Chase sent the money they only left of XXXX of interest in the account. It was never officially closed until on XX/XX/XXXX and Chase allowed me to open it. Do you think that if landlords found out about this, they would keep their business with Chase?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I recently disputed information on my credit reports due to upon pulling my report for business opportunity, I noticed inaccuracies in the form of a bankruptcy, wrong personal information, unauthorized inquiries and I addressed these issues with this company. I included letters I wrote to Court and XXXX which is where they stated they verified the bankruptcy and I included letters from these same entities stating they did NOT and do NOT verify this information resulting in XXXX deleting the item from their record. I am very distraught because their lack of cooperation is not only hurting my credibility and character but costing me business opportunities as well. I recently suffered the loss of my veteran husband and I am trying to stand on my own without unnecessary setbacks. I am including the letters I received from the court and XXXX, the same letters I included to the company."
Checking or savings account,"On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX, my debit card was charged at a Chase ATM 4 times for an amount of {$200.00} each for a total of {$800.00} between XXXX and XXXX. The bank was able to reimburse this money back to my account. Shortly after the atm withdrawals, on the same day in the afternoon, the XXXX down the street fraudulently charged my debit card {$750.00} through XXXX XXXX. Chase hasnt reimbursed the XXXX charge. The XXXX is # XXXX XXXX XXXX in NJ. The phone number is XXXX. The manager was able to confirm the person who came in and made the transaction did not match my description and is caught on camera. I was told the footage is still available. I was at XXXX of XXXX in New York at the time. 

I stopped the debit card on Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX. Chase sent me a new debit card in the mail. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I had not received the card yet. It was compromised and a charge of around {$3000.00} tried to go through. Since I didnt activate the card, it did not go through. Chase canceled that card and then issued me another one. On Wednesday XXXX, Chase claimed the account had been compromised and shut it down. They gave me a new account. 

I have called and had Chase relook into to the XXXX claim several times. After the 3rd time, Chase told me the case is officially closed. After they told me the case is officially closed, Chase suggested I call XXXX. It had been several weeks in at that point. The XXXX was helpful, but they would need Chase to contact their loss prevention office to reimburse me the money. 

I went to my physical Chase branch location since I had not received an explanation as to why my claim was denied. A letter was sent in the mail saying, Here are the notes we have in our system : Transaction conducted within customer geographical location. Lack of Digit wallet security care. 

Shortly after, I filed a report with the police."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I placed an order for XXXX XXXX  cleaners for {$XXXX} XXXX. The order was only partially fulfilled by the vendor. I contacted the vendor by email, telephone message, XXXX, and XXXX without any response. 

After allowing a week for a response from any channel and receiving none from the vendor I initiated a dispute online a the Chase disputes website. The dispute form does not easily allow for partial disputes so I opened the dispute and the followed up with a telephone call. The amount in dispute is XXXX of the order price as only XXXX of the order was shipped. {$XXXX} On XX/XX/XXXX I received a note from Chase that I had validated the charge and that they would be rebelled. 

I had not validated the charge. I followed up by contacting Chase Disputes at the number on the letter and they insisted that I had on XX/XX/XXXX ( which is absolutely impossible as I was in XXXX during that time ). They insisted I had to re-open the dispute by mail. I have copied their letter, replied that I never validated the entire charge, that the dispute for {$XXXX} is still valid. 

Chase is argumentative and unhelpful. They improperly closed a dispute in violation of the Fair Credit Billing Act. I have met all my obligations by timely filing my dispute and timely follow up to their invalid closure of the dispute."
Mortgage,My husband passed who was a veteran and I tried to get mortgage assistance to lower my mortgage payment. Round point my mortgage servicer refused to help me with lowering my mortgage payment. I called them a lot of time for assistance with my mortgage. I'm still living in the property and I want to keep my house. I'm elderly and need help
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX XXXX "" XXXX XXXX '' telling my my XXXX frequent flyer account had been terminated. The reason was vague, multiple choice and more of a form letter that anything specific. At the same time they canceled 3 flights of a set I was about to start taking on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I had accumulated XXXX miles in this XXXX account. This from a combination of credit card offers, direct spend on these credit cards and yes, some miles from 2 specific revenue flights. The flights that were canceled has cost an additional XXXX total from my XXXX account. 

On to the Citi part. From some internet research about this issue, it appears that XXXX  is doing this to many "" customers ''. The consensus is apparently that I obtained too many credit cards ( and associated bonus miles ) from Citi. Their belief is that using only Citi 's most strict rules, you can only get 3 or so credit cards in a 2 year period. Offers that Citi sends through the USPS mail have less strict restrictions and it is easy to obtain more than the limits XXXX  is applying. 

In short, Citi approved "" too many '' credit cards for me and Citi 's partner, XXXX XXXX, thought that my count was too high. Without warning or recourse, they closed my account. Citi provided me with generous credit card sign up bonuses that were subsequently taken away by their partner, XXXX. XXXX believes it can do anything it wants with its program and for any reason. Citi does not provide a warning during the application process and somehow happily allows customers to sign up for too many ( in XXXX  's eyes ).

The frustrating part about this is that Citi can claim it was XXXX  committing this foul, where XXXX   makes vague claims and the bottom line is it thinks Citi gave out too many credit cards with bonuses. 

I suspect XXXX  sold these miles to Citi. Citi issues them to me after meeting various financial obligations ( a significant cost to me ), then XXXX  takes them away? What kind of scam is this? 

I will note, also, that Citi continues to offer XXXX XXXX credit cards to  customers with XXXX  mile bonuses. I still don't see a warning about XXXX  's "" right '' to take them away as they please."
Mortgage,"We sold our home on XX/XX/XXXX. The closing attorney and Mr. cooper mailed checks to XXXX County Ga. Tax office. The check from the closing attorney was received XXXX and cashed. The check from nation star dba Mr. Cooper was received and then returned to Mr. cooper on XX/XX/XXXX. Mr. Cooper received the check back on XX/XX/XXXX. I have spoken to Mr. cooper in XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX. I was told in XXXX that it would be 6-8 weeks before I received my refund. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told that it will now be XXXX before I will be given a refund. They stated that the XXXX county GA tax office would not be issuing a check to them until that time. I contacted the XXXX County tax office and as they stated to me before, the check was mailed back to Mr. cooper and they have not received another check from them, so there is no reason for Mr. cooper to say XXXX County will be issuing them a check. The amount is XXXX.I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX cancellation of deed to secure debt. I have spoken to people from Mr. cooper who can not understand why I must wait 9 months to have my escrow returned after the home has been sold, the account paid in full and I never missed a payment with this company. I would appreciate any help in this matter"
Student loan,"I apparently was in default back in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, and before I became aware of the default my student loans were once again transferred to another company and I didn't have any clue who my new creditor was. I barely found out about my new creditor was Navient and the default on XX/XX/XXXX. Also on a side note my loans were suppose to be in deferment since I was a full time XXXX. I then called Navient to discuss the 6, 120 day late payments on my credit report. They said I was obligated to pay even though my deferment should have rolled out until XX/XX/XXXX. I told them I did take the summer off of school but starting in the fall I would be back in school at least half time, so my loans would go back in deferment. One lady from Navient then told me that once the school sent there information to them I would be placed in deferment and the deferment would be back dated to the month I became in default and the late payments would be removed. One month later Navient received the information from the school and my loans were put into deferment. After checking my credit report I saw the late payment status/derogatory still as my status on my credit report. I spoke with another Navient representative about how can I remove the late payments so my credit score wouldn't be damaged since I was trying to buy a house. She informed me that since I was in deferment the late payments would no longer be in effect but they report at the end of each month to the credit bureaus so it just hadn't been updated. I called again a month later and spoke with another representative and asked her how much do I need to pay to get the late payments removed from my credit report, she told me I do not owe anything and the late payments had already been processed so she couldn't do anything about it. Which I waited two months from being told by a representative that they would come off to being told I couldn't pay the over due amount I owed to remove the late payments. I have never heard of a creditor refusing to take payment that was around {$850.00} to help pay off the overdue balance and fees that I owed. I do not feel that I was ever informed properly about my student loans and the policy of deferment for a student that has to have a half time or full time XXXX status to qualify for deferment."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax, a credit reporting and monitoring company who is responsible for handling my personally identifiable information ( PII ), mishandled my PII which allowed for the information to potentially be compromised. They believe the my PII was compromised. The discovery of this issue happened inXX/XX/XXXX, however the estimated 143 million people that were impacted or may have been impacted were not informed. By their own admission, they will not be informing everyone. 

They provide the option, along with the other credit reporting companies, to freeze your credit to protect against others fraudulently using my PII to obtain financial services in my name. Unfortunately, they charge for this service absent of a police report or file through the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ).  It is completely unacceptable that consumers will have to pay Equifax, the company who mishandled their PII, to freeze their PII so that hackers who obtained their PII due to Equifax 's mishandling of their PII can not use that PII that they would n't have had if Equifax had not mishandled that same PII. This needs to be a free service, or suits need to happen to refund everyone who paid for this service ( including interest ) afterXX/XX/XXXX. Filing a report and going through official channels takes time, and in the time it will take to go through these steps to obtain a free credit freeze, damage may already have been done which will affect future transactions and add to the cost of those for any impacted consumer. 

Their entire business model is holding consumers accountable for their financial decisions. Equifax should be held accountable for their security decisions."
"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","On XX/XX/19, I called Western Union to get the correct information to wire transfer funds to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told them they were formerly known as XXXX XXXX so they suggested the transfer to XXXX XXXX. XXXX purchased XXXX XXXX XXXX so they said the information had not changed. Therefore, I sent the funds from a Prepaid MasterCard that isn't re-loadable. When XXXX XXXX did not receive the funds, I called Western Union again on XX/XX/19. I was told at that time to wait until XXXX for them to receive funds that was received on the same day XX/XX/19.  On XX/XX/19, Western Union told me the funds went XXXX XXXX in which the previous representative neglected to tell me. The representative did not read any previous notes regarding the transfer therefore I asked for a supervisor. The representative placed me on hold then the phone started ringing again and rang over 10 -15 mins before I found a Customer Relations number for Western Union. I spoke to XXXX (Customer Relations) and once again no one took ownership of the issue not did she try to assist me. XXXX heard me say supervisor then placed me on hold for 2 -3 mins to get a supervisor. Then XXXX came to line to say you are asking for a supervisor"" hold please so I held another 5 mins. Next XXXX (Possibly a supervisor) told me they requested the money from XXXX so I said ""I thought it was XXXX XXXXl "" then apologized ""Oh yes XXXX XXXX. He says they are waiting for permission from XXXX XXXX to get money that isn't theirs. The time frame is 24- 48 hours but it is past 48 hours but XXXX says they have not received permission to take money that does not belong to XXXX XXXX. He stated the refund would go back to the bank... as I stated this card is non-reloadable so he says they would send the funds to a Western Union location. Then I needed to pick up the money from a Western Union destination so I asked about the fee of $XXXX. He stated the funds were sent so I would not get the fee back. That's unacceptable!!!"

Mortgage,"I fell behind on my payments when my hours were cut at work. I knew I could catch up again after my tax return arrived. I received one phone call a month from the mortgage company that left a message. The person whispered the message that was not able to be understood. I did not know who to return a call to. I tried the loss mitigation process once before and it piled up endless fees and led to harassing phone calls and being yelled at, insulted, intimidation tactics, and peculiar questioning. No one was able to tell me what those late fees were at that time either. I could not log in to my account. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a certified letter stating that for reinstatement to pay XXXX. That same day I went to the bank, purchased a bank check for the exact amount, went to the post office and sent it priority mail to arrive XX/XX/XXXX. OnXX/XX/XXXX a person from XXXX  XXXX phoned me and I told her I sent the amount in the letter XX/XX/XXXX. She then stated an amount very different from what was in the letter the day before. I told her that I sent the exact amount that was stated in the letter. She told me it brought me to XX/XX/XXXX payment due and asked me when I would be able to pay this. I told her I would pay it before the end of the month and the late fees. She said that would be fine since my account had not been assigned to an attorney. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter and a paper for an Automated Property service on my property. They are charging me {$14.00} for this.

On XX/XX/ I received another one of their letters stating they received my funds but because they have accelerated my loan and the payment was insufficient to pay what is owned on the loan or reinstate the loan, they are continuing with the foreclosure. Nothing has ever given me a date or time frame and what is lacking in fees is never stated. I then went to see if I could access my account, this time it let me in so I could see if I can find out what these fees were. I was then going to go in on XX/XX/XXXX to pay them. When I got off the phone with a CFPB  representative to do so, XXXX XXXX has taken away my ability to pay it online since last night ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I also sent them an email that has not been given a response other than locking me out of my ability to make a payment. At this time I found the fees that I owe that are {$120.00}. It shows Late charge assessment- {$95.00} and Property Inspection Fee- {$28.00}. However, as I said earlier, they have locked me out of my account as of today XX/XX/XXXX so I can not pay this fee or my mortgage for XX/XX/XXXX Of {$930.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received the same letter as on XX/XX/XXXX by certified mail. 
They are intending to foreclose on my property for the fees they refused to share with me in the amount of {$120.00}. I sent them the email to see if they would tell me what it was, but I did my own digging around to find them myself. I know this is not legal for them to withhold information and threaten a foreclosure. Then after I go in to find the information they lock me out of my account so I can not make a payment. I do not understand how they can withhold this information and do a foreclosure for such a small amount. I just have my current months mortgage payment to pay and their hidden fees. I also do not understand how they can charge {$14.00} for printing out a piece of paper and call it a Property Inspection Fee, and charge me the same amount each month."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I submitted the dispute number : XXXX on XX/XX/2018.

Responsibilities of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies [ 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ] The report agency Transunion has to investigate in 30 days.

I was supposed to have until XX/XX/XXXX interest free. I trusted that My Synchrony would not charge me interest, and I put my account on Auto Pay.

A few months ago, I discovered the bank had been charging me "" Card Security '' fee every month. In addition, they were also charging me interest all along!!! "" Card Security '' fees ranged from $ XXXX- {$40.00} dollars a month, and interest within that range as well.

I called the bank several times to get to the bottom of this issue. However, they kept sending me in circles. When I called the number on the back of my CareCredit card, they said that this so-called "" Card Security '' service is not from the bank itself. They gave me a different number to call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was finally issued a refund for {$830.00}. I never requested this service. They should have never charged me this "" hidden '' fee. This is malpractice.

Adding insult to injury, the interest refund I received was only {$20.00}. It is the interest charge for XX/XX/XXXX ONLY. This bank has been charging me interest for years. I called repeatedly, and they have either ignored me, or manipulated me in an endless circle of talking to different people and no one can do anything. Every time I asked for a supervisor, they regurgitated the same old response "" We will escalate this issue and respond within 5 business days ''. It has been months and I still don't have a simple response.

I learned through persistent calls that interest charges were associated with "" Card Security '', and Synchrony Bank kept telling me they "" couldn't remove those charges. '' Again, I never requested this service, and I was incurring interest charges for a service I never requested. I called "" Card Security '' over and over again, and they said they couldn't do anything to remove those charges, and that the issue will be escalated. I received a call from a woman named XXXX  once or twice, who claims to be XXXX XXXX, and I have been calling her again and again. I could not get a hold of her.

Mortgage,"The absolute worst mortgage servicing company we have ever worked with. Absolutely terrible customer service and completely dishonest. Borderline predatory on VA customers. 

Working with Lakeview XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not respond to e-mails, or phone calls in a timely manner. This was for a VA Streamline refinance in which they reached out to us to initiate. 

Our mortgage closing date was delayed significantly, due to no response/contact after all documents were ready for closing, which caused us to incur late fees with our previous mortgage company, and when asked if should call XXXX XXXX XXXX, we were advised no. Speaking with XXXX XXXX XXXX they stated it is standard for loan officers to call or advise consumers to call and they would waive the fee. 

We asked approximately six times across both personnel to ensure our Escrow came back to us, via phone, e-mail and official documentation. On XXXX XXXX we spoke with XXXX directly to understand what the current delay was and ensure our election referencing the escrow was still in consideration and he assured us that our escrow would come back. 

We have documents from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that stated that XXXX contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, the next day, and explicit asked for a second payoff letter TO INCLUDE the escrow in the payoff ( what we explicitly reminded him we did not want and he acknowledged the day before ). 

Further, the timeline from initiation to closing was completely unacceptable for a streamline refinance and was further compounded by the amount of phone calls and e-mails that went unanswered by XXXX XXXX. 

Post closing we sent 3 follow up emails to both personnel with a requested response and did not receive one.

Why to cover illegal inaccurate spreads of escrow shortage of funds in their possession. SLS ' failed to file insurance claims to correct their errors which and refused to honor my request that a Stay be placed on any/all account activity until SLS corrected said errors in handle my escrow. Said failure has resulted in one and a half years both financial and emotional abuse due to errors of SLS and failure refusal to correct them in a timely manner, which must end now, in XXXX of XXXX. 

SLS doubled my monthly payment to correct errors of miss calculating my escrow, refunding excess escrow, reducing my monthly payment {$660.00} for 10 months, everyone knows 10 x {$660.00} is {$66000.00}, but SLS insisted I had a {$19000.00} escrow shortage and refused to produce escrow bills paid to demonstrate said claimed shortage. To prevent my home from going to foreclosure due to said increase/unaffordable payment I suggested the funds be taken from my principal account instead. For the next 100 days SLS slowed removed over {$9000.00} from my principal account to reduce said shortage down to over {$10000.00}. SLS changed my payment in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX for said illegal changes in payments and took my XXXX payment without me missing a payment causing my account to be one month delinquent for over a year ruining my credit.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I opened my Capital One account in XXXX of last year and since that time, have not made one late payment ; in fact, I have always paid early, and always paid well over the minimum payment amount due. I was shocked to see that after my most recent payment of {XXXX} which was well before the due date ... that my credit score had a significant drop, noting that that Capital One had closed my account. I called Capital One believing there must be an error, and was notified that it was due to return payments. These payments were a result of me using the Capital One App for payments and unfortunately, I switched bank accounts and inadvertently had a wrong number for my new bank account. When I saw the payment was not accepted, I thought perhaps it was the fault of the new bank, so I tried again, immediately, but it was again rejected. After calling my bank to determine it was not them rejecting, I double checked and realized I input the wrong bank account number in payment app & immediately fixed it. My payment cleared ; again before the due date and well above minimum payment amount. The App does not let me delete that incorrect bank info that I could tell, and this past month, I didn't catch that it defaulted to the one that was entered incorrectly, and slid the indicator to pay from what I assumed was the proper and most recently used bank account. As soon as I saw that the payment was rejected, I realized that the App defaulted to the incorrect bank account information and I resubmitted payment ; still well before the payment due date. I explained this to 5 people including 2 supervisors ; requested they reconsider the closure of the card, noting that they can review and see that this is exactly what happened and there's no dispute that I always pay early and above the amount. They indicated that these inadvertent bank issues resulted in me having 5 violations and thus, there is nothing they can do and I would have to reapply for credit. But I can not reapply for credit because their actions resulted in my credit score dropping significantly. They've harmed my livelihood and ability to get credit going forward all due to their closure for a short period of app issues, despite my stellar payments. I feel this closure is not in good faith and a review of my Card Agreement does not indicate that there closure of my account was justified. I do not believe a person that pays 100 % early and more than necessary is in violation of the Card Agreement, nor should they suffer the penalty of having my livelihood and ability to get credit going forward impacted. Add to it that my data was among those impacted by their breach, so they've caused harm to me in two manners."

We found someone that was approved by management and everything was set for that individual to take over our lease on XX/XX/XXXX. We also stated we would be cleaning our apartment ourselves and the manager had someone come in to clean the apartment while we were still moving out, even though we communicated that we would not be paying to have someone clean the apartment. While moving out, the manager called me and stated that the replacement tenant "" may not work out '' because his XXXX photos had skulls in them and they were "" scary. '' I was told a few days later by the manager that the replacement tenant was no longer going to be taking the apartment ( even though he was trying to pay his first month of rent and still wanted the apartment ) and that the manager would be able to find someone to move into our apartment within one week of us moving out. I never heard anything else from XXXX until the end of XX/XX/XXXX when the manager asked for our new address. The manager stated we would have some "" move-out '' charges and apologized. I received a bill two weeks later for XX/XX/XXXX rent and cleaning fees, etc. I tried contacting XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( who manages XXXX ) throughout XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which I also have proof of.

A few weeks ago I asked for a payoff amount for my car, since it was having major repair issues and was advised I need to pay {$20000.00} to pay off the car, almost four years has passed mind you. According to Consumer Portfolios Services payment history, I have paid them {$13000.00} dollars and of that amount {$2300.00} has been applied to the purchase price, the balance of XXXX was for interest and fees. When I called to speak to a customer service representative she got very snippy with me, stating this was a simple interest loan and because I was behind they were charging me {$9.00} per day. I said that I never got a copy of my loan agreement and I would like it sent out immediately and she said she would make the request. That was over a month ago and I still do not have anything from them. At the time I was past due, but Consumer Portfolio reported that I was current to the credit bureaus and yet they are still charging. I am at my wits end with this loan and a car that will not last much longer. Is this legal to just keep adding charges and fees to a loan so basically you wont have a car, but will just be paying money on top of money for nothing. This is the craziest thing I have ever seen or heard of and I am afraid I will be without a car and without a way to get a new one to get to work."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a Goodyear credit card at a local tire store. The application was approved same-day but they refuse to send the credit card to the current address on the application. The first minimal payment is due in a few weeks and I am not able to set up an online account to pay the bill.

I called Goodyear several times and they notified me that they sent it to a previous address which they pulled from somewhere. There's a reason why I put my current address on the application! I volunteered to send proof of current address ( copy of drivers license, voter registration card ) but they refused when I called. They also said they needed to verify by TXT'ing my cell phone with a code. I said OK but then they said that their computer was unable to do that."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have emails and recorded phone calls dating back to 2017 proving retaliation, abuse of authority, refusing to remove fraudulent information from my credit report, failing ( refusing ) to  provide updates on status of investigations. The Office of Consumer Affairs, in XXXX, GA, has discriminated against me. The staff is unprofessional. They have intentionally refused to remove fraudulent information from my credit report. 

I am specifically requesting an agent with CFPB contact me to investigate XXXX, and specifically its Office of Consumer Affairs. The XXXX American customer service representatives : XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and others have violated my rights since XX/XX/2017. Theyve continued to allow companies like Bonneville Collections and others to put fraudulent collections on my credit report. These customer service representatives will put fraudulent addresses BACK on my credit report that have been previously disputed and removed. 

The prejudice, discrimination and racism Ive endured since XX/XX/2017 by the Office of Consumer Affairs has taken a toll on my health. Im under extreme duress by their continued attacks. They use their positions with XXXX to appear that theyre following the law and responsibility of the office, however, they are not. They are bullies. They are quietly and discretely attacking my credit report and credit score.

Currently there are 3 hard inquiries on my credit report that were not requested by me. I did not authorize these inquiries. There is currently 1 fraudulent collections item from Bonneville Collections on my credit report. I have been reporting fraudulent collections actions on my credit report for 3 years consistently. I am consistently dealing with the same customer service representatives in the office of Consumer Affairs. For the past 3 months Ive been fighting to remove the fraudulent collection action by Bonneville Collections. XXXX has merely relied upon a statement submitted by Bonneville Collections that the debt is valid. There was no evidence that submitted proving that the debt is valid. This type of action, by XXXX Office of Consumer Affairs has taken place since XX/XX/2017. 

The actions of the Office of Consumer Affairs via XX/XX/XXXX are harassing me. Their conduct should be illegal. When I contact XX/XX/XXXX, when my social security number, address, and date of birth are verified by representatives in another country, I am always transferred to the Office of Consumer Affairs. There is something in XX/XX/XXXX system that requires me to be sent to the XXXX Office of Consumer Affairs.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","I paid my step daughters college tuition for last semester. She was paying me back a portion of the tuition in the amount of {$3000.00}. She transmitted the money to me via PayPal , Inc. GA XXXX # XXXX, XXXX # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. I received a notice from PayPal Inc on XX/XX/XXXX stating the transaction was on hold. They requested several documents to verify my identity including my driver 's license, bank statement, among other documents. I provided those documents to PayPal, Inc on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then received an email stating the transaction was declined. I contacted PayPal via telephone and was told my transaction was flagged as fraud and the money would be held for six months. I asked why it was flagged, and was told they can't tell me and it was done in the back office. I called several more times. I finally got a supervisor and explained the situation. He said the money would be held for six months. He stated the reason for the hold was for possible complaints by the buyer or seller. I explained this isn't a sales transaction. I further asked if my step daughter and I signed a release stating there wasn't any dispute would they let the transaction go through or just refund it to my step daughter. She then could transmit the money via a check. I was told that wasn't a possibility. 

My step daughter also contacted them and was told the money would be held for six months and there was nothing they could do about it. It is clear they don't want to return the money. 

I have reviewed the company on line. There was a class action lawsuit for the same issue of them holding onto people 's money for no justification. The company hold s the money in a corporate account and earn interest off of this money according to the class action lawsuit. Paypal , IncXXXX paid out a tremendous amount on that class action lawsuit. 

I have no additional course of action at this point in time. I have also sent a letter to the CEO of PayPay, Inc."
Student loan,On XX/XX/2011 a master promissory note for a federal parent plus loan was filled out using my information and signed by my ex-wife.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I do not understand the CFPB 's process. I have explained in great detail what transpired, and have supporting monthly credit card statements that prove that Wells Fargo is fraudulently charging interest to my visa card each and every month. I have previously responded to your agency regarding the Wells Fargo statement that they deny my allegation. I believe this may be the third time that I have submitted a response indicating that they continue to deceive your agency and for some reason you appear to believe them. It is my understanding that the sole function of CFPB is to protect us consumers against the illegal predatory practices of mega corporations '. Congressman XXXX 's office told me that your agency has little to no desire to go after the mega banks. Maybe the CFPB lacks the authority and resources to do so. If this is true, then your agency should refer this matter to the FBI or Secret Service. I am continuing to accumulate Well Fargo monthly statements that will vividly support my allegations. It's your move ; please do something to help me prove that what Wells Fargo is doing to me and maybe millions of their other customers is fraud and illegal. Thank-you, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran and Senior Citizen"
Student loan,"I called in to make a payment on or about XX/XX/2019. I spoke to a representative who advised me of different payment options to bring my loan current. She told me that my payment would be around {$570.00} and that I would not have any capitalized interest. I specifically asked her about the amount of my payment and about the capitalized interest. She gave me answers to those questions before I agreed to the forbearance. She then put me in the IVR to say I accepted what she told me. Then, she set me up on auto payment and told me that my payment would be lower the next month because I would get the interest rate point deduction for being enrolled in auto pay. I called Navient on XX/XX/2019 to request that my next payment be drafted on XX/XX/2019. I was advised at that time that my next payment was going to be around {$610.00} dollars. This was higher than the representative quoted so I requested to be transferred to the department that handled this. 
I spoke with XXXX, a supervisor in that department. I asked him to review the phone call I had with the representative before I voiced my complaint, as I wanted to make sure I was remembering the XX/XX/XXXX called correctly. He reviewed the call and called me back. He confirmed that the representative did give me incorrect information. Specifically, she told me that my payments would be {$570.00} dollars per month and she told me that I would not have capitalized interest. She also told me that my interest rate would be reduced due to enrollment in the auto pay. She told me all of those things and that is what I relied upon in making the decision to enroll in this forbearance. He told me that it did not matter that she told me this incorrect information because I accepted the terms on the ivr system. He said there was nothing he could do."

The copied old accounts that were previously paid. For example I had one loan through chase, now I have 9 total loans that showed zero payments and the account has been closed. I made payments to that loan when I was in school and it was paid off before I even graduated. Now shows up as nine negative things on my credit statement and the original loan isnt even on there anymore. The number provided to XXXX XXXX XXXX   as the dad is the number to a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have about 40 other debts to the Department of Education and I was city thats been close for 10 years. Im showing Student Loans on my account from when before I even started school. I am being sent fake mpns, and the Department of Education cant tell if these are fake and PMs because theyre not educated on what the identification number on the MPNs actually means, that arent even valid but still being registered through the department education as it being a valid debt. I havent been able to have a bank account or a credit card in over 10 years because of all this improper reporting on my credit. In 2015 I had my entire life savings account how old and taken from me to pay for this debt. My father has been contacted since he was the cosigner on one of the loans, he has paid over {$60000.00} to this company and I was city thats now shut down. I have paid over {$50000.00} to the company in XXXX XXXX thats now shut down. I had {$20000.00} seized out of my bank account and I dont know where this money was sent to. Someone needs to pay me back the money thats been taken because of all of this somebody needs to be held accountable and someone needs to pay me back and stop people from taking more money from me and allowed me to actually have a bank account as are all violations of my consumer rights they are violating son of Sam laws by trying to make a profit off of any of this and none of them should even be in business if they cant even contact me to let me know that my information was breached. I want my money reimbursed and I want these fraudulent credit reporting agencies to be shut down because they are not reporting anything close to accurate on anybodys credit report due to this bridge and they have no intention of fixing it or they would have by me submitting the five different times Ive tried dispute everything on my credit file and everything came back as not disputable because they were valid debts but yet only my name and a dead amount is on 3 % of the reports so I dont know how they contacted anybody if there wasnt even a name given"

I have XXXX XXXX my federal loans. My credit reports are showing that I was late with payments to XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX-XXXX  ( or XXXX ) XX/XX/XXXX on one of my federal student loans. I spoke with a XXXX representative in XX/XX/XXXX who looked at my account and verified that I was never late during this period and never received any sort of notification that would indicate such. In fact, there was no delinquency showing on any of my credit reports until XX/XX/XXXX, which was suddenly reporting that I was several months past due. Apparently there was a balance generated in XXXX XXXX system associated with my forbearance 5+years ago, that should have been covered by my payment and wasn't, and was never communicated to me, despite my account being in autopayment and making timely monthly payments. The XXXX   representative indicated she was escalating this matter to the credit reporting division, and that it would be corrected in about two weeks. Again, in XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus was supposed to be correcting this incorrect information. Despite this, I keep getting notified from XXXX that the investigation is complete, and yet the information is still the same ( see attached screenshot ) .This reporting is negatively affecting my applications for credit. I sent my XXXX statements to XXXX  et al showing that I have never been notified of any delinquency on this account, and told them how unfair that I as the consumer have to prove my innocence, versus the debtor having to prove this a valid debt ( apparently the debtor just has to acknowledge its reporting is correct and that is sufficient ). I have asked XXXX et al and XXXX several times to re-investigate this matter. They each claim they have looked into it, and yet I am still seeing this error on my report. Attached to this complaint are my statements from XXXX showing my account information. The payment summary in the top right corner shows when XXXX  received its last payment, when the next payment is due, and for how much. As you will see, there is never a late amount mentioned or due.

In the year XXXX I requested transactional information of our auto loan agreement. To date Navy Federal Credit Union has not provided the information I have requested. Due to the fact that Navy Federal Credit Union either refused or failed to provide the essential transactional information I requested I informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I would cease to remit any payments to Navy Federal Credit Union as I was not sure and had doubts of the accuracy of the information of the auto loan agreement we signed. 
On several occasions in XXXX and XXXX Navy Federal Credit Union contacted me about payment to my auto loan agreement. I never informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I refused or did not want to pay, I merely informed Navy Federal Credit Union that I would make payments upon receiving the transactional information I requested to ensure I was making the correct payments and in accordance with the agreement. I informed Navy Federal Credit Union that there was an error in my auto loan agreement and that I wanted to review the information first before making payments. Navy Federal Credit Union refused to provide the information.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email ( see attachment 1 ) from BBVA Compass Bank saying I would receive a one-time bonus of XXXX rewards points if I paid a utility bill with my BBVA Compass Bank credit card. The offer stated that I must : ( 1 ) contact my utility service provider to enroll my BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card in the service provider 's automatic bill payment system between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; and ( 2 ) pay a bill to my utility service provider using my enrolled BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card by XX/XX/XXXX. 
I clicked on the link to enroll in the promotion and received a confirmation page ( see attachment 2 ) saying I was enrolled in the promotion. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I enrolled my BBVA Credit Card in my water bills automatic bill payment system, and a payment was made using my BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card ( see attachment 3 ). 
I waited until near the end of XXXX and noticed I had not received the XXXX rewards points. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a SM ( secure message ) asking about the bonus rewards points and when I might expect to receive them ( see attachment 4 ). 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a SM response ( see attachment 5 ). XXXX XXXX stated that she reviewed my account and confirmed the utility payment on XX/XX/XXXX. She also said that my points should be in my account by the end of XXXX. She said they have to wait 10-12 weeks after the promotion ends to process the promotion batch and award out the points to their customers. She said the promotion ended on XX/XX/XXXX so by the end of XXXX the point should be in my account. 
I waited and kept checking my account and saw by the end of XXXX I still had not received the bonus rewards points. I sent a SM and was instructed to call BBVA on the phone. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called BBVA Compass and spoke with XXXX, a specialist from the rewards dept. First she said that I had not enrolled in the promotion. I stated that I had received a confirmation page saying I was enrolled and could send it to her. 
Then she said that I had not fulfilled the promotion because I was supposed to make recurring payments and not just one payment. We went over the terms of the promotion and I stated that I had fulfilled the two parts of the contract : I had ( 1 ) contacted my utility service provider and enrolled my BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card in the service provider 's automatic bill payment system between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( I enrolled XX/XX/XXXX ) ; and ( 2 ) I had paid a bill to my utility service provider using my enrolled BBVA Compass Visa Credit Card by XX/XX/XXXX ( I paid a bill on XX/XX/XXXX8 ). 
She insisted that the promotion stated that I needed to make several payments, yet she was not able to provide evidence of this requirement. The promotion says a bill needs to be paid. The fine print does not say there needed to be two, three, or four bills paid. 
I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said she would forward my request to a supervisor and to send her a copy of the email promotion. I sent her the email and she called me to say that after talking to the back office that I had not followed the promotion which required me to pay more than one bill. She made no mention of escalating my request to a supervisor even with my insistence. 
I would have been more than willing to make several payments if these instructions were included in the rules of the promotion. I feel I followed the rules of the promotion and am respectfully asking for the bonus XXXX points to be added to my BBVA Compass Credit card account. 
Thank you."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX, I ran my annual free credit report with all three credit reporting companies.

She did transfer from XXXX XXXX University after the XXXX school year to XXXX   XXXX University for the XXXX school year ( and until graduation ).

When I received an invoice requesting a payment, I immediately contacted PHEAA/FED LOAN SERVICING and they said they had the paperwork informing them of the change but it would take 60-90 days to update in their system. In my opinion, this issue may be the cause of their reporting error. 

I did not owe a payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I HAVE NEVER OWED A PAYMENT TO DATE. Therefore, they must correct the XX/XX/XXXX payment they are reporting. I disputed through all three credit bureaus who contacted PHEAA/FED LOAN SERVICING who responded back with the same exact incorrect information regarding XX/XX/XXXX. When I called PHEAA/FED LOAN SERVICING directly their response was "" dispute it through the credit bureaus ; '' which is unacceptable. I did upload a general complaint form directly to PHEAA/FED LOAN SERVICING that has resulted in no change."

I request full documentation of what you received from the provider of service in connection with this alleged debt. 

Additionally, any reporting of this debt to the credit bureaus prior to allowing me to validate it may be a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which can allow me to seek damages from a collection agent. I will await your reply with above requested proof.

Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX XXXX is showing an increased balance on Account Type/ Account for Loans on my credit report.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I read about the Equifax breach on the morning of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, and decided to look into it to determine if my data was at risk. 
I visited the www.equifaxsecurity2017.com website, and thought it was interesting that it was a separate domain instead of a sub-domain of the equifax.com domain. I did additional research, and checked the XXXX records, which appeared to be anonymous ; I could n't find any information in the XXXX record indicating any affiliation to Equifax. I did a little more digging, and found a news article XXXX https : XXXX? XXXX ) indicating that the site was, in fact, set up by Equifax as a breach notification website. 
I submitted the information requested ( last name and last six digits of SSN ), and was told that my data may have been involved in the security breach. 
I 'm quite frankly concerned and bewildered at why it took Equifax so long to disclose the breach, and why I had to learn that my data was involved by stumbling upon an article rather than the company reaching out to me. 
I 've placed a fraud alert on my file through XXXX XXXX website, so I should have a 90-day window to detect and prevent any misuse of my data, but if my data is still out there, it could be floating around cyberspace forever."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I applied for a XXXX 's credit card today XX/XX/20 and unfortunately, I was not approved. I called them to ask why I was not approved and they told that the reason is that there are five accounts in negative standing appearing on my credit report. I had no idea what accounts they were talking about since I have always maintained good payment history on any card or loan I have had. I got a copy of my credit report and I saw those five accounts and none of them belong to me. I did not open any of these accounts nor do I have any written/verbal contract with any of those companies ; I am not affiliated to the companies I have listed on this report in any way and I did not benefit anything from these accounts that were opened in my name without my permission such as money, goods or services.

Credit card or prepaid card,"On or about XX/XX/2016, my American Express Serve card was closed by American Express for unusual usage patterns. Having been a loyal customer for roughly the 2 years prior to this closure, this came as a shock and surprise as I had routinely used the Serve product with no other customer service concerns. My usage was frequent and well within the rules set in place by American Express when I first signed up for this product. While I did not lose any money, I lost a valuable consumer product that I had come to rely on and used in a frequent and repeated way. 

I contacted American Express numerous times to inquire about the usage patterns, but never responded to or followed up on. As this product was important to me, I have repeatedly tried to re-sign up for this product, but American Express has repeatedly denied me access to a new product with only vague, unclear reasons. It appears American Express has purposely blacklisted me from this product line. 

This arbitrary closure has burdened me and forced me to find other, more expensive and questionable products to help me with prepaid needs. It also concerned me that American Express or another company could close my account ( s ) with little to no reason other than me not being profitable to them. 

I would like to be reinstated or able to open a new Serve prepaid product from American Express. I fear that if banks can arbitrarily close consumer products and blacklist customers from the product in the future, that banks would like to discriminate against any customer they want while hiding behind vague reasons for all its customers."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On Tuesday, XX/XX/2018 XXXX AM, I received a fully booked invitation to visit the "" XXXX XXXX '' ( An Independent Indian Tribe Local Government in Oklahoma ), this invite included the Flight, the hotel and a rental car. Everything was accurately planned and scheduled and sent to me. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I traveled without any problem, picked the car, checked in at the hotel with no problem at all. 
It is the norm that I authorize the incidental costs on my credit card, I never had a problem. 

Everything went so well, I returned the car, with the gas tank half-full and I did return it on time as it was sent to me in the plan I had in hand. 

Thu, XX/XX/2018, I was hit by a charge on the car rental, I called and emailed customer service of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' to investigate about that charge, and I was nice enough to say if you want to charge me about the half tank gas, it is OK, you can charge me for the full tank as per the price agreed upon and return the rest of the money. 
I requested a bill, they actually did send me a bill of {$130.00} that includes the whole thing with the rental ( that was paid for already ) with the gas with everything, I called my bank ( Capital One ) to dispute and a nice lady interfered and I stayed over an hour on the phone, 1- If my total bill is {$130.00} only why am I charged with {$170.00}? 
2- I claim that I owe them only half a tank which is according to the prices is {$38.00}. 

They offered to give 50 % discount, convincing us to get 50 % of the {$170.00}, which I hatefully agreed on and I was refunded {$19.00}. 
I rejected that refund while I was still over the phone with my bank and the merchant. 
I tried so hard to have answers for the above 2 questions. I never succeeded. 
The banker agreed to give me 100 % refund and asked me to submit all the documents I have that prove my trip was fully booked. 
I did provide all the documents I had which show clearly my point. 

XX/XX/XXXX, I found that I was re-billed the amount .. 
I called again, my bank, the banker confirmed they received all my documents and he was confused, struggling with words and told me that I had to talk to his manager.

The manager, she can not do anything about it and I will have to go to the Merchant to bring a signed bill because they do not know how much to charge me.

She wanted to convince me that {$170.00} is the price of the gas and that {$19.00} is half of the price of the gas. She did not make any sense, I have all the phone records ( as they do ) and all the documentations as well.. I am ready to escalate this to the court if this is not resolved."

Within a few days I got a certified letter saying my account was over 90 days past due and my car could be repossessed. I was also receiving repeated calls from Nissan about my "" past due '' account. Apparently the rep had applied so much money towards principal that she immediately put my loan 90+ days past due.

In the past my mother and father filed Bankruptcy and that public record landed on my credit report for years! I was unable to get a car, house, or anything. I didn't know where to go for information. I finally walked into a bankruptcy office and showed proof of identity and they removed it. This also happened with my younger brother using his nick name and resulted in medical bills totaling {$7000.00} being inaccurately reported to my file. I worked hard to removed those accounts. It's unfair and not right that these company 's just pin these accounts on family members of the people that benefited from the credit accounts. They also need to find a better way to find the people. I was told that MRS looked up the address and reported the delinquent account that way instead of reporting the account by the social security number. XXXX by address is XXXX and is wrong, not a good a practice because my sister and brother did live with me at one point.

I believe this is an unjust claim for them to take my Federal Taxes and Oklahoma State Taxes due to the nature of the claim. To resolve the problem, I would appreciate and request a full refund. I look forward to your reply and a resolution to my problem, I will wait hopefully for sometime in XX/XX/XXXX for a resolution.

I dont know where theyre getting their total. When I asked for documentation, Navient sent me a promissory note for {$1800.00}.! 
This is ridiculous. I have paid back more than I ever borrowed and at this rate, I will never stop paying and I dont even know what Im paying for.

Also, my interest rate is 7.75 %. Navient says that Congress sets that rate, but I'm not sure if that's accurate."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I was a victim of identity theft in XX/XX/2017 in which someone stole person information, filed my taxes and began opening and attempting to open several fraudulent accounts in my name. I have been working with local law enforcement, the three credit reporting agencies and the account lenders. 

In sending in copies of police reports, federal trade commission reports, proof of my ID as the rightful owner and other supporting documents, over the past two years I have obtained little to no success in trying to successfully remove these accounts from my credit report. I have in writing, on several occasions asked that the lenders send me proof of whatever SIGNED documents that have confirming that these accounts were opened by "" me '' and they have not responded or sent me copies of these documents per my request. When I speak with the credit reporting agencies, they simply state that the debts were verified by the lenders but CAN NOT either provide me with the requested documents to corroborate their investigations. 

I have been denied job opportunities, other loans, and even bank accounts due to these accounts and at this point I want results. I want in writing whatever documents they have that were alleged signed by me and want these fraudulent accounts removed from my credit reports."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I had an open balance with my XXXX XXXX credit card which is a Synchrony Bank account. I paid off that balance and had {$0.00} amount on the card. However, last week when I went to use the card because of deals that were advertised to me I was told that my card did not work and was declined, which was extremely embarrassing. I called the Sychrony contact # and explained the situation and they confirmed that my account had been closed automatically but for reasons that did not make any sense. I explained to them that nothing had changed since I first enrolled for the card but the person I spoke with said she could not do anything but would open a case and a letter would be mailed to me. 

2 days ago, XX/XX/XXXX, I received this letter stating the reasons why my account was closed was from a credit report from XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX. This was the first time I was told my account was closed, the letter is dated XX/XX/XXXX and was sent from Florida. Not sure why I was not notified or warned sooner. 

I contacted a person today about this so called "" case '' and they said there wasn't anything that they could do once the account was closed all I could do is go to XXXX and dispute the closed card on my credit report. I believe they did not take proper steps in closing my account and that my account was wrongfully closed. My credit score has taken a plunge and I don't know what to do next."
Checking or savings account,"I XXXX XXXX saw that TD bank had a promotion where you can qualify for {XXXX} bonus by opening an account. I had an account back in XXXX so i visited the XXXX MA branch on XX/XX/XXXX and i explained to the teller XXXX that i was interested in opening an account to take part in the promotion. I also explained to her than I had an account back in XXXX so I wanted her to check to confirm if i would qualify or not for the promotion. She checked her computer system and advised that she couldn't find anything in the system for me so I would be considered a new customer. She also advised that i would have to also open the account online to qualify so I proceeded to open the account online via my mobile device. Once the account was opened i deposited {$2500.00} to  avoid the monthly maintenance fees and XXXX printed me a debit card. I proceeded to set up my direct deposit at my job which started on XX/XX/XXXX for {$800.00} and that amount reoccurred until XX/XX/XXXX and after that my direct deposit was changed to {$5.00} which is currently on going. In total between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I've direct deposited {$4000.00}  from my payroll which surpasses the {$2500.00} requirement within 60 days which would be XX/XX/XXXX. I called multiple times and i was advised that I 100 % qualify and meet the requirements of the promotion ( {$300.00} bonus ). Now 107 days later when its time to pay the bonus they are advising me that I don't qualify because i had an account before. If they told me this back in XXXX when i visited the Melrose branch I wouldn't have wasted my time and tied up my money and changing my direct deposit for all those months. The customer service rep advised me to go to the branch since this issue started at the branch and the branch can send an email to the promotion team requesting an exception to be made since the error was on their part. I visited the XXXX branch on XX/XX/XXXX and had a meeting with XXXX XXXX whom is the store manager. She supported me and sent the email to the promotion team requesting the exception be made so that I would receive the {$300.00} bonus. I followed up with the TD branch on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to the customer service rep XXXX whom advised me that they did get a reply from their promotion team whom are still refusing to honor the {$300.00} bonus. At this point I'm going to close my account at TD bank. I find this to be a very deceiving practice on their part. If that representative took a little more time to advise me correctly i wouldn't have wasted my TIME and energy to open the account to get the bonus. Most banks after a year or two you're considered a new customer, so when XXXX advised me that I would be considered as a new customer since its been almost three years according to me ( XXXX ) and she cant find any records for me on file, I had no reason to doubt her and went ahead and invested my TIME and money. I strongly believe that TD bank should honor the {$300.00} bonus to me. I look forward to your response and resolution to this matter.

Debt collection,"This is the third time I have complained about this exact same issue. The first time the collection agency said "" oh he owes it '' and that satisfied CFPB.

My wife attempted contact with the hospital and they refused to speak to her "" because she's not the responsible party ''. 
Please. 
Respect yourself enough to do your job. 
The collection agency has nothing signed by me agreeing to a debt. I was not there. My insurance was not used. It's not my debt. I'm not the responsible party. There is absolutely no proof that this is my debt, because it's not. I was on shift that day, all day.

Debt collection,"My complaint is for The XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in XXXX KY. About a year ago I was sent there to have a medical procedure for a missed XXXX. They did not submit my claim to my insurance. They didn't send me a single bill, basically I have been waiting and told things like it can take six months for the claim to go through and they have a year to bill you. I'm still waiting on my bill about about 1yr and 1 wk after the procedure. I check my credit every couple of months and see a new collection account for {$6500.00} and that is what it was for. They never sent the claim to my insurance because that is well above what my yearly out of pocket maximum would cost. I called the billing Dept at the hospital and asked about it and they told me they can't do anything about it because of the time frame. I called the collection agency they sent it to, they picked a random address off of my credit report I guess and told me I had the wrong address on file, I have kept my address current and updated it with the hospital and everything the day XXXX had to go. I had not lived at that address in 5 years and never when I used this hospital. They are trying to tell me it's my fault because of having an old address with them, which I have never had an account with that particular collection agency either. I have used this hospital 2 times in my life and they didn't send a bill either time, just straight to collections right around the time when they won't let me fight it anymore and when it's too late to negotiate a payment plan. The first time I found out they finally sent a bill straight to collections, I found out when they froze my bank account, this time, I check my credit regularly now because I don't trust them and found it that way with nothing about it from XXXX hospital or the collection agency through the mail or otherwise yet."

The account was immediately close, new cards were issued and new accounts issued. A claim was sent to the Fraud dept. to look over. They denied that it was fraud through the dept. 4 separate times, each time siting incorrect reasoning for denying the claim. I have been calling into the department no less than three times for each claim, so 12 multi hour phone calls have been used to try and get to the bottom of this issue.

Mortgage,"My home mortgage is with Chase Bank. Beginning about XX/XX/2018 Chase Bank began to show the date of the latest consumer payment in the top right corner of mailed statement. I like using the Chase app to schedule my payment every month on their website. I schedule the payment for the 1st ;  if it is a holiday - I scheduled it for the day prior. I schedule the Chase payment during the middle of each month for the first of the upcoming month. I have never been late at all with this mortgage. However, I just noticed the other day that, in small print on the monthly mortgage statement, it states what date they received a payment. On my statements, there are many received payment dates of the XXXX and of the XXXX. They are not posting correctly ; all were scheduled for the first of the month ; or the day prior if the first is a holiday. And, each month, it is a Chase Bank App that I schedule on. I still have all the composition books I used during the last few years. I am simply asking for the data ( of when Chase received by "" checks '' over their database ) to be corrected on my records. Instead, it reflects the date when the checks cleared the bank."

This was a XXXX XXXX XXXX.I was constantly overcharged repo my car once by error and they kept my money. Also several times charging me numerous late fees up 3 times in one month. They kept on over billeing me I kept paying them then finally they threaten to repo and they came and took car while I was asleep, gave me no notice to claim car back they kept car and money.

One day I received a note from a forwarded mail, saying I was going to jail if I did not pay them from XXXX office i called and spoke with a rep who threatened me and cursedme out. I then called the sherriffs they said no knowledge of any warrant in their database none existed. Just last week I found out a bench warrant issued for XXXX in court which I had not been served.

Debt collection,"Tonight ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX19 ), I received a credit monitoring alert that a new derogatory account was listed on my credit report. I immediately noticed it as a debt that was already paid. I never received any call or letter informing me of the debt - it just magically appeared on my credit report. I called the collection agency to find out what was going on. The balance was {$50.00} even. I told the collector that I had never received any phone call or documentation via mail about the debt, and requested that to be sent to my address because the debt was not mine. She informed me that she would not provide that to me and that I was responsible for the outstanding balance after insurance and to pay it now. I told her that this wasn't my debt but to avoid the headache, if she would send me a letter in writing stating that if I paid the balance this negative information would be removed from my credit report, I'd pay immediately. I don't pay anyone without knowing exactly what I owe and for what, and she was very defensive when I requested validation. Instead, she emailed me a notice to collect without any requested financial information. I have already paid the collection to the original creditor, so I am hesitant to pay anything else without proof that I owe this money. I called back to request that I not be contacted by phone and spoke to another collector. She attempted to collect the debt once more, and I explained the event that occurred previously. She told me that I was lying about what I was saying, and both of the collectors used baby talk to try to get me to understand what they were saying. I was well aware of my rights and knew that my request for debt validation was sound."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I leased a XXXX XXXX XXXX that was financed through Nisan Motor Acceptance Corp. ( NMAC ). That lease comes due on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to three different Nissan dealers, all of whom told me that Nissan would waive up to the last four payments on my lease if I purchased a new vehicle from Nissan. As I was planning on doing just that I made the XXXX, XXXX payment on time but made no subsequent payments. 
In early XXXX, I started receiving a very high volume of calls from NMAC telling me that my auto lease payments were late. Every time I mentioned them waiving payments, they told me to go see a dealer. Finally NMAC told me that I had to go see the dealer who originally sold me the vehicle, even though they are over XXXX miles from my home, as I have recently moved. 
I complied with the instructions from NMAC and went to the dealer they specified. At that dealer, I was able to find that NMAC had reported me late for two month 's worth of auto lease payments and by doing so, NMAC had caused my FICO score to drop from from XXXX to XXXX. Because of the drop in FICO score and the lease payment lateness, Nissan would not lease me another vehicle even though my payment history over the previous 33 months was always on-time. And, unfortunately. because of Nissan 's report, no other auto lender would give me a loan or a lease. 
Their actions have been damaging, predatory and not in keeping with what the dealers told me. The two months late ( XXXX and XXXX ) have been paid and Nissan will still not approve me for a lease."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax has potentially given away my personal, private information and compromised my identity when they were hacked on XX/XX/XXXX. I checked the status of my information on XX/XX/XXXX and was alerted that there is reason to believe I am one of many involved in mass identity theft."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","On XX/XX/2019, a collection account in the amount of {$400.00} was added to my credit report from a company I have never heard of, nor have I received any documentation stating that I owe this debt. Midwest Recovery Systems is the name of the company. They claim they are collecting a debt from a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX, who is not a company I have done business with. Searching online, I have found this is a severely fraudulent company and many others have had this same situation happen. I disputed it with XXXX, but they did not complete a thorough enough investigation and left it on my credit report. On XX/XX/2019, this same debt was added to my XXXX  report. I am in the process of disputing it with them also. 

Reading these reviews, I have found this company also has violated many collection laws with some threatening arrest and so on. It makes me think that this is the same company that reached out to me a few months ago at my work, telling my boss that I was going to be arrested for not paying a debt. I ignored them because I knew it wasn't true. It all sounds connected to this fraudulent activity on my report now. At that time, I had filed a complaint with the FTC and Attorney Generals office for the State of Michigan. After that, I never received another call. 

I do not understand how this can happen. There needs to be better accountability by the credit bureaus to protect consumers from this type of action that can affect so much in our lives."

On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to an associate and asked for a payoff amount for this vehicle. She indicated that I would need to pay an additional {$5400.00} to satisfy this loan. 

I have already paid Prestige Financial a grand total of {$28000.00}. If I were to payoff this vehicle today with that payoff amount, I will have paid Prestige Financial {$16000.00} more than my original loan. More than double the amount of my original loan. HOW is that a reality? There is no reasonable explanation for paying Prestige Financial more than double my original loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I asked Prestige to address this issue that day. As far as I am concerned I have more than satisfied my obligation to Prestige. I have already paid you {$11000.00} MORE than my original loan. That HAS TO have satisfied any interest on the loan.

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","My parents who are not in the states sent me a wire transaction of XXXX dollars XX/XX/2019 to my Chase checking account, however I provided a wrong account number but with all other information correct like my name and address etc. 
After we find out the fund didn't arrive at my account due to a wrong account number provided a week after XXXX, we filed a withdraw request to Chase bank asking for refund. Then Global solution center of Chase bank has been telling me they had been keep investigating it and they said that the fund has already went to the beneficiary 's account ( which is the wrong account ) and they were trying to get contact with that guy for the next 2-3 months during which they never updated with me even when they closed the case. After that I turned to a branch manager to ask for help and this kind manager have been helping me making a lot of calls to different department to ask about the investigating result.

Then, after ending up with no result, the manager helped me escalate it to complain department  which gave me a final decision that they won't be able to get the fund back. 
During the past 6 months, I have heard different versions from the Chase bank like the money has/has n't went to beneficiary 's account. Also Chase once said the my parents had the name that matched the wrong account number which is absolutely impossible. 
I understand that Chase should not be blamed for me providing the wrong account number, but how can they not even try to match the name for the account? Even some online purchase need to verify your billing address to approve the transaction."
Vehicle loan or lease,Prestige claims to be a second chance loan offering. They aren't. They take advantage of people with incredibly high interest rate loans that they tack fees upon fees on to the note. They offer to help but they really seem to want to hurt people more than anything.
Mortgage,"Wells Fargo is my lender, I am grateful they gave me a loan modification about 6 years ago. I have not had a single 30 day late since the loan was modified. 
my problem with the loan is ; the first payment increase after being fixed for 5 years was 16.5 % on the first adjustment.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I have had this card for 7 years. Not once have I ever had issues paying the card before it was reported to collections or considered 'late. ' I've been traveling out of the country for two months and during this time, I was robbed, which locked me out of some of my accounts that XXXX passwords ( since I had to change passwords to protect myself ). Though, this shouldn't have been a big deal since I knew the answers to my backup questions. I was robbed on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Every time I leave the country, I can not log into my XXXX account. I am blocked and it requires me to answers a security question, yet the security question is always flagged as incorrect and locks down the account. 

On this past occasion, I tried MULTIPLE times to log into the account, and every time failed. At this point, the account was becoming past due because of my failed attempts to access my account. I tried contacting customer service ( and you can check their call logs for this ), and was unsuccessful to log in. 

I then tried to make a phone payment since I couldn't log in, and after I did, I realized that the payment was never taken out of my bank account. The payment was originally made on XX/XX/XXXX when I received access back to my passwords/had a phone/etc. So I called customer support, who first FINALLY helped me get into my account, only to discover that the last 2 digits of the bank account was switched and the payment was taken from the wrong account. Since I was logged in, I paid directly right away. I made this payment again on XX/XX/XXXX. 

What I CAN NOT understand is how I was NOT notified until the payment was returned and why these numbers were not checked when the payment was made. 

When I contacted XXXX on MULTIPLE occasions after this, stating that I had notice the payment wasn't taken and asked what I needed to do, as I had never paid on the phone, and asked for then the report to be removed from my score, as it greatly impacted my score, they refused to help and blamed me for being out of the country and not trying to mail my payment. I'm not sure when it's safe to mail a payment, but this shouldn't have even had to be an option if I could have accessed the account. I was also blamed for typing in the numbers wrong ( which was absolutely not my intention ) and then blamed for not speaking to a real human instead when that option wasn't even given. 

This has absolutely been the worst service I have experienced and I can not understand how it isn't possible to remove the late payment due to the issues. I also do not understand why an accidental typing of incorrect numbers is my fault if a payment is made over the phone, as I would assume this information would be verified first."

Miraculously the same day I raised awareness about my ESCROW account being negative, was the same day my ESCROW account was in good standings. At this point I started doing a lot of investigating and going over my disclosures carefully. There were a few red flags on my disclosures such as the wrong race ( which I complained about before ), it indicated that I've done a phone interview ( I clearly did a face to face interview ), an extra brokers point was taken from closing, the RESCIND documents were never present nor signed, a fraudulent Commitment was made to buy my loan some approval time and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the actual broker that closed my loan ) name ws nowhere to be found on my disclosures.

My credit card number had changed just before the refund but the bank assured me that my older card number was still linked to my account and any refunds will still reflect on my account. 

I also reached out to Google which is where XXXX posted the refund. They have been unable to locate the funds as well. My Google Wallet account at the time showed that it's linked to a virtual XXXX card which only Google has details on. They never confirmed if they checked with XXXX to see if the funds we actually received. I can provide email messages between me and Google if needed. 

I also contacted XXXX again and they recommended that I contact XXXX which I did. Unfortunately they were unable to provide any info on that virtual card as I do not own it. 

Therefore it appears to me that Google Wallet is the only missing link here and they are the ones who can be able to find out what actually happened in that transfer. I have attempted several times to reach Google but I always hit a brick wall. 

Please assist me in tracing this money. Let me know if you need more details."
Mortgage,"Bayview Financial Loan Service held our mortgage from XX/XX/XXXX toXX/XX/XXXX. Starting in XX/XX/XXXX they illegally forced and charged me for a duplicate insurance policy. My insurance I had carried all along was still active and in place yet they doubled up on a policy and forced me to pay it. I spend over a year providing documents and following all procedures they insisted on in order to clear it up. Due to the monthly payment increase I was unable to keep up with the additional increase that was unjustly being charged. Many attempts were made to modify the loan, yet Bayview was non-responsive. By XX/XX/XXXX I was advised and pushed into a corner to stop payment completely and file for a short sale on the property. During the short sale of the property, Bayview was investigated several time by the federal government and disciplined for their inadequate and wrongful practices. This short sale was finalized and paid for in XXXX of XXXX. I was told this history would only reflect and show detriment to my credit for a couple of years. As I apply for loans, I am constantly haunted by this troubling past. I would like all the accounts associated with Bayview to be cleared off my credit. Thank you for your help."

Debt collection,"I have been receiving 3 to 6 robocalls each day (including weekends and holidays) to my cell phone from Synchrony Bank (XXXX, XXXX) in an attempt to collect a debt. The calls began in XX/XX/2019 when my accounts were not more than 45 days delinquent and at times start prior to XXXX, the earliest call being XXXX. I have been working with a debt settlement program since XX/XX/2019 which has been in contact with Synchrony Bank and is in the negotiation process on all  accounts yet I still receive these calls. I ended up blocking the numbers and sending all calls directly to voicemail. My voicemail specifically states that I do not accept calls from unidentified numbers, robocalls calls, or automated messages and to leave a live voicemail and I will return the call. The XXXX number is the only number to leave a voicemail and only on 3 occasions. The voicemails were automated voicemails and did not identify the caller but requested me to contact the phone number and also provided an address. Looking up the address on the internet helped my identify the caller as Synchrony Bank. I finally called the number back yesterday after being extremely frustrated with the notifications going off on my phone for the blocked calls and no messages being left. I have also begun to receive calls from pinger numbers within 2 minutes of receiving a call from Synchrony. This is absolute harrassment. They cannot robocall my cell phone in an attempt to collect a debt, cannot call prior to XXXX, and they cannot call my phone that many times a day and not identify themselves. If they are using the pinger numbers that increases the level of harassment.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I applied for a Frontier Mastercard in the last week of XX/XX/2019. I had to call after booking my flight because I was denied in the web application and I knew that was a mistake since my FICO and credit score were both very high and I always pay my bills on time. I was approved when I called and subsequently called back to make sure i was getting the advertised promotion, XXXX bonus miles after a {$500.00} spend within the first 90 days. I spoke to XXXX in the customer service department that day, who confirmed I would be getting XXXX bonus miles, he also confirmed the annual fee of {$79.00} ( which is fine ) and the {$100.00} flight voucher every year when reaching a minimum spend ... It's funny because I was also entitled to the flight voucher within 30 days but my card didn't arrive in the mail before my flight to XXXX XXXX so I basically had to forfeit my {$100.00} .... Already an annoyance but technically not fraud. The customer service agent on I spoke to about my XXXX bonus miles WHEN I OPENED MY ACCOUNT had an identifier of "" XXXX '' ( named XXXX ) and I spoke to him at XXXX MST on XX/XX/XXXX via telephone. I asked if he would send me any kind of confirmation of the XXXX promotion and he said there would be no need. Great. Well, the liars and thieves at BarclayCard only gave me XXXX miles and said that was the promotion at the time I applied when I called them yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). LIES. I want them to review the phone call and HONOR what I was TOLD when I called. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor yesterday, hung up on me, and then responded to my online complaint that I don't know what I am talking about. But I demand a transcript of my call with XXXX if they are not going to honor what was discussed. The current promotion is actually XXXX miles so really they're just being cheapskates by not giving me the XXXX. I was supposed to have gotten my first flight for free too ( well, {$100.00} off ... ) but I'm not even complaining about THAT since I get the card in the mail before my first flight so I'm not worried about that ( since those terms were not met ), but I am only worried about the XXXX miles being basically stolen from me and Barclays lying over and over again about it. This is so wrong and I feel so cheated and it is ILLEGAL TO DO THIS."
Credit card or prepaid card,"In XX/XX/2018 I paid for XXXX services to XXXX XXXX XXXX to prepared and process my XXXX with the state of GA and the IRS. I was sent and email with the articles and by laws that were prepared along with a receipt of the XXXX filing. My application was rejected the first time and had to be resubmitted. While the XXXX  went through the paper work in not properly showing me as the XXXX of which as of today needs to me corrected. I have made multiple attempts to contact XXXX XXXX the preparer and have not been successful with making contact or receiving a return call.After receiving no response from Ms XXXX I disputed the charge with XXXX XXXX my credit card company in the amount of {$440.00} for incomplete services. I could not open a bank account with they paper work she prepared because it was inefficient. Mrs XXXX also sent a prefilled application to me alleging that she was sending it to the IRS and I should receive my correspondences from the IRS within 4-6 weeks. After not hearing anything I called the IRS to check on the filing, and they have no record of it being submitted. I call twice just to make sure. 

Ms XXXX disputed the charge and in her response she claims that she didn't know that the {$270.00} filing fee had not gone through, how ever she never provided a confirmation of receipt of filing as she did with the incorporation. In her dispute she alleges that her paper work was sufficient, and it is not. I don't have any thing filed with the IRS, My paper work is invalid, I can not open up a bank account until somethings are corrected with my incorporation. 

Capitol One has returned the funds to Ms XXXX despite the admission in her email regarding the {$270.00} filing IRS fee, and a letter from the Manager of XXXX XXXX of which I provided regarding their review of of my paper work from their business dept in my attempt to open an account. The asked me to provide something in writing from a financial institution and I did. On. XX/XX/2018 I spoke with XXXX Customer ID XXXX was on the phone tirelessly trying to resolve this issue for the 3rd time. Since our conversation, The Charge of {$540.00} appeared to have been re billed on my card 4 times. This is financial XXXX.Anyone seen reviewing my account that this is not an error, my account has been mishandled since this dispute and I am very disappointed. My balance is not above my credit limit and I can't afford to with my work and school schedule to try an battle with a customer service representation that has no compassion, lack of understanding, and won't help me get my account and my dispute resolved. 

I am in need of assistance at another level, I want this to go to the corporate level so they can here my complaint. I have asked that this matter be escalated and to to avail I have not heard from the next level management. 

Issues With The paper work are the following.. 

1.On the GA Articles I am supposed to be listed as the XXXX the error She has me listed as the XXXX 2. The IRS application is just that and application and has not been submitted to the IRS nor has the fee been paid 3. Capitol One is not willing to call to verify anything, however they want me to get it in writing, I have tried to request it in writing, but it has not been successful. I have tried to have the IRS on a 3way and the Capital One refuse to take a verbal verification, I advised them I was told they could not provide anything in writing"

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I researched further on the Wells Fargo Auto that I still pay to on my truck. The credit report shows that Wells Fargo has a negative mark on mine so that was how I decided to research. I have learned that I still owe them {$4700.00}. 

I decided to call XXXX XXXX XXXX who I first made payments to before it was transferred to Wells Fargo. The total of the truck worth was actual {$30.00}. However, I paid for over 5 years which is from XXXX, XXXX to XXXX, XXXX which brings to over {$31000.00} but I also recently paid from XXXX, XXXX to XXXX, XXXX so that is total of {$3100.00}. I already paid {$31000.00} AND total of {$3100.00}, so in together on two amounts, I paid over {$34000.00} AND XXXX XXXX XXXX did not report to you ... I paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which I believe is over {$7600.00} because with XXXX XXXX XXXX was first I paid to ... about {$540.00} per month. {$7600.00} was paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is the total of {$42000.00}. So {$42000.00} was already paid!! And too much!!! My truck should be paid off a long time ago. 

However, Wells Fargo Auto said I owe them more, that is the amount of {$4700.00}!! What?! If so, it would be {$47000.00} later on! The real price was {$30.00} when I first bought it! Wells Fargo has ripped me off big time. I did call XXXX XXXX XXXX to find out why they did not report to 3 credit bureaus since XXXX XXXX XXXX is missing on all. However, the problem falls on Wells Fargo because agreement was on 6 % or 8 %. It is still too high ... I would pay over {$17000.00} MORE! I ask you to investigate on Wells Fargo. They know I am deaf. I believe they took advantage thinking I would not investigate this further. Thanks to XXXX that shows Wells Fargo has a negative mark. 

I complained to you about Wells Fargo yesterday for the wrong info on late payments in XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and it was first. I sent them the letter of going to be late and promised them that I would pay FULL AMOUNT and I did. They did not put me in a good standing. So with that information, I dug further on Wells Fargo so that was when I realize I have paid too much on my truck already and it should be paid off. Please investigate on Wells Fargo and penalize them!"
Checking or savings account,"XX/XX/2019 Customer : XXXX XXXX XXXX CR XXXX XXXX XXXX, Texas XXXX USAA Customer # XXXX Company : USAA XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX ( XXXX ) XXXX Complaint : On XX/XX/2019 I received a letter from USAA indicating that I had a late payment on my auto insurance. I was threatened that if I submitted another late payment I would not have access to my accounts ( checking, savings, policy, products, etc. ). In addition, I would not have access to additional services and/or products from USAA. My payment was made within the grace period, and my insurance has never been cancelled due to non-payment in 28 years. 

On XX/XX/2019 I called USAA to inform them that I made all auto insurance payments within the due dates and/or grace periods. My insurance has never been cancelled or reinstated in the 28 years I have been banking with USAA. The employee confirmed that my insurance has never been cancelled and all payments have been received within the time dates and/or grace periods allowed. 

1 ) I received a threatening letter indicating that future late payments would result in punitive actions such as no access to accounts, policy 's, and/or products.

2 ) USAA does not specifically stipulate what is considered as a punitive payment time period. When is a payment considered late with punitive measures ( no access to accounts and/or products )?

3 ) Is a payment beyond the grace period, such as a cancellation of auto policy equal no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products?

4 ) Is a late payment within the grace period still terms for cancellation of auto policy, no access to accounts, products and services ; and deem that a customer does not have access to their checking/savings accounts or USAA products?

The attached letter from USAA was offensive. My payments have always been made within the payment date and/or grace period of payment. If USAA is going to submit such offensive, threatening, oppressive, and harassing letters ; it is important that USAA clearly defines such punitive measures to their customers.

Resolution : Without retaliation upon this customer, USAA needs to define punitive measures and at what point punitive action will be taken. Further, do these punitive measures follow the state law and regulations with the FDIC, State Board of Insurance, and the Consumer Financial Bureau? Are punitive measures fair  practices or discriminatory practices? Is it fair to ban a customer from an insurance policy or cancel a policy, lose access to checking and savings accounts, lose access to usaa.com, lose access to automated voice response system, and unable to acquire new products and services on the basis that the customer is late, however has made payments within USAAs stipulated grace period? 

It seems that left undefined by USAA is discriminatory to the customer, especially if the customer has paid within the grace period criteria and the customer has never received a cancelation in a purchased policy. 

I do believe USAA needs guidance in defining punitive customer exclusionary practices and measures. This should be approached without retaliatory measures to the customer. After complaining on XX/XX/2019 at approximately XXXX my account was locked and I have no access to my accounts. This seems a bit suppressive, oppressive, and discriminatory to the customer. I would like it resolved promptly.

"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","I have a complaint with Synchrony Bank, regarding my CareCredit account. First, I will admit I have been delinquent on my account and I am not denying I have fallen behind regarding even my minimum payments. After living in XXXX XXXX for 20 years, I moved out because it has become too expensive to live there over the years. I moved to the outer area of XXXX, OH, and living with my elderly father to assist him since he is alone but does not need a caretaker. 

After I arrived, I attempted to call Synchrony to make payment arrangements to make some payment on my account. I had received a letter regarding that my account had been forwarded to a collections agency. On XX/XX/18, I attempted to call the collections company, but no luck as the agent I was talking to didnt seem to understand English as I had repeated my name five times - even spelling it, and the person still could not comprehend what I was telling him or her, for I couldnt tell. Frustrated, I then called Synchrony Bank directly to make contact and was able to get through. The person I spoke with understood me and seemed like she knew what she was doing, not an offshore call center and she sounded older. I let her know my financial situation at the time, that I would be making payments on my account but I wasnt exactly sure when exactly I would be making them. But at least one {$100.00} payment on my account in the next month. She continued to notate on my account, and asked me if I could make two payments around certain dates ; I agreed to making two payments in the month of XX/XX/2018. I gave her a ballpark idea of dates since I was unemployed ; she set actual dates I needed to make payment by : XX/XX/18 and XX/XX/18, but never let on as those being exact set dates. This whole time, I stated with the assumption I was making an old school, promise-to-pay on my account and that I would be making the two {$100.00} payments myself online, not permitting Synchrony to automatically take two {$100.00} payments in XX/XX/2018 on set dates. She also verified my account information, including my checking account was still the same. 

So thinking I was late with my first payment, I made an online payment myself XX/XX/18 to Synchrony for {$100.00}. A few days later XX/XX/18, another payment for {$100.00} was processed by Synchrony automatically and not by me. I didnt notice this for at least a week, and was baffled how that happened. I went online XX/XX/18 and removed my checking account information to prevent this from happening again since {$200.00} was paid as promised by then. Days after I removed my bank information, another {$100.00} payment was processed on XX/XX/18 by Synchrony. As soon as I caught this on XX/XX/18, I called Synchrony to file a complaint and have the payment credited back to me as financially this put my checking account in the red. I told them I never authorized for them to automatically take money out of my account for payments and that I agreed to make the two {$100.00} payments myself online. I was transferred over to a supervisor, but the issue was not resolved at that moment as the blame seemed to be put on me by her, and that if I verified my account information including my checking account information, that I was authorizing them to automatically process payments to my Synchrony account. I was also told that my complaint would take 30 days to investigate before I would be considered for a refund. I asked how could they legally still process a payment if I had removed my checking account information from my profile, but no clear answer was given except that I had verified my checking account information and thus permitting money to be withdrawn by Synchrony. 

Weeks later, I called back Synchrony and told them to stop my claim as that third payment would cover me for XXXX payment, even though I did not approve for them to automatically take it from my checking account. This call was to an offshore call center, and agent assumed if you are not working you can collect unemployment. And of course, they asked for more payment. Also did not receive anything in writing from Synchrony in regard to these payments nor any emails.

So basically at this point, I am apprehensive to make payment to Synchrony because of this that occurred. I would think what they did was wrong on their part. Please investigate the practices of Synchrony CareCredit, so this does not happen again. And if I was wrong, then I understand but I know from my perspective what my intentions were."
Mortgage,"I have a mortgage through Watermark Capital serviced by XXXX. The first payment was due XX/XX/2019. I make payments through a bill payment service. When I did not see the first payment post at the XXXX website, I made a payment directly through their website to insure I was not late on the first payment. Turns out myloancare was just slow in posting the payment made through the bill payment service, so it ended up that I made the first payment twice. 

In early XXXX, I noticed that rather than applying the second payment to principal, they applied it as if it was early for the next month. They also applied the impounds to the next month, rather than to the principal. 

Since early XXXX, I have spent hours waiting on hold, left messages that were not returned, and have spoken with five agents - XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX - a manger, and XXXX. Each of the agents said the issue would resolved in some number of days ( varied among agents ) or that I would get call back by a manager. In each case, nothing was done and there was no follow-up.

Debt collection,This company is fraudulently reporting a collection account and each it is disputed onn my credit report it is verified the information from the credit reporting agency AWA verified as correct and they increase the balance by {$1.00} harming my credit score each time. I have provided by certified letter my correct mailing address and a written dispute and a copy of the receipt. I paid the original creditor and have been disputing this several times over the last few years. I brought my receipt to original creditor whom I prepaid for the procedure and they stated that it was reported to collections in error and XX/XX/2016 it was manually cleared from collections. Office Manager XXXX showed me on her computer when I visited the office about this collections problem it was cleared manually in XX/XX/2016 and AWA was manually notified this debt was sent to collections in error and she stated she knew a collection manager at AWA and would have it deleted ASAP. The next day the collection balance was increased with the credit reporting agency and dropped my credit score again. This company is in violation with the law. Also the original creditor stated they have never verified this debt as valid and was shocked at the problem I was having. I am a consumer with rights and they are not only ignoring them they add a dollar to the balance every time I try to dispute this. So they are purposely harming my credit for a debt that was not only paid but PREPAID before the procedure was done.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Currently, MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT is reporting several accounts that is misinformation, account number XXXX reporting as XXXX XXXX. XXXX reporting as XXXX XXXX,XXXX, and XXXX.These accounts have been disputed both under FEderal and under North Carolina law . 
Special Rules Governing Debt Buyers North Carolina was the first state in the nation to enact legislation to protect consumers against the abusive practices of debt buyers. The Prohibited Practices by Collection Agencies at N.C.G.S. Chapter 58, Article 70, governs debt collection agencies operating in North Carolina. As of XX/XX/XXXX, this Chapter also governs the activities of debt buyers operating in the state. 

A. Who is a debt buyer? N.C.G.S. 58-70-15 ( b ) ( 4 ) categorizes a debt buyer as a type of collection agency, meaning that it must comply with the same regulations as collection agencies under Chapter 58 : A debt buyer. As used in this subdivision, the term "" debt buyer '' means a person or entity that is engaged in the business of purchasing delinquent or chargedoff consumer loans or consumer credit accounts, or other delinquent consumer debt for collection purposes, whether it collects the debt itself or hires a third party for collection or an attorneyatlaw for litigation in order to collect such debt.Critics claim that junk debt buyers clog court systems throughout the United States with complaints based on inadequate and incomplete information. XXXX XXXX, Automated Debt-Collection Lawsuits Engulf Courts, XXXX XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Haunted by XXXX Debt, XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. 
Case law documents instances where junk debt buyers have sued North Carolinians who merely had a similar name as the actual debtor on the account. 
See, e.g., XXXX v. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( M.D.N.C. XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) ). Debt buyers have also sued persons who were the victims of identity theft on identity theft accounts. See XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX ) ). 
Such wrongful lawsuits occur because debt buyers purchase accounts for pennies on the dollar, often with little or no documentation of actual amounts owed, the terms of account agreements, or meaningful identification of account holders : The problems resulting from this overall lack of proof or accuracy are myriad, leading to thousands of dubious judgments entered by default. XXXX XXXX, Defending Junk XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, Vol. XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Complaint Requirements for Debt Buyers : Unfortunately, many consumers may not receive the required pre-suit notice or may mistake it for just another collection letter on an  account that they do not believe they owe. Therefore, the XXXX also subjects debt buyers to heightened pleading requirements. N.C.G.S. 
XXXX. 
This standard addresses the public policy concern that a debt buyer should show prior to obtaining a default judgment that it is the rightful owner of the account in question and that the amount claimed due is accurate in terms of actual charges incurred, as well as late fees, overlimit fees, interest accrued, attorneys fees owed, and the like. 
Under the XXXX, a debt buyer must attach certain materials to any complaint that it files : ( 1 ) A copy of the contract or other writing evidencing the original debt, which must contain a signature of the defendant. If a claim is based on credit card debt and no such signed writing evidencing the original debt ever existed, then copies of documents generated when the credit card was actually used must be attached.

( 2 ) A copy of the assignment or other writing establishing that the plaintiff is the owner of the debt. If the debt has been assigned more than once, then each assignment or other writing evidencing transfer of ownership must be attached to establish an unbroken chain of ownership. 
Each assignment or other writing evidencing transfer of ownership must contain the original account number of the debt purchased and must clearly show the debtor 's name associated with that account number. 
To date MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT has not provided any proof under XXXX tthat would constitue any validation as a matter of record MIDLAND CREDIT MANAGEMENT continues to operate in the state of North Carolina with complete disregard to its general statues MIDLAND has not provided any documentation on the account level as well as any documents with my signature to say these accounts are mine and still report themto the bureas"

"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service","My sister transferred money to my account as an emergency cover for some expenses this morning. She used Zelle/clearXchange through her XXXX platform in order to get the money to me immediately. I have sent her payments though Zelle and it goes through within moments- 15 minutes at the outside. 
I got a confirmation email that a payment had been sent to me through Zelle/clearXchange, and that I should check my account for the deposit. Both companies were listed- in face it was stated stated that clearXchange is now Zelle .

Not only was the money not showing up when I called- hours later I found out that it was not due to be visible for 3 business days!

When I initially called Zelle they told me that had no idea what would take so long and that length of transaction was up to the bank sending the money. So, I called XXXX the issuing bank. They informed XXXX that no, the money went into the the Zelle/clearXchange network immediately and it was now their proces. I then called Zelle/clearXchange back and was told I just needed to activate my email for money transfer through Zelle. I tried that, was impossible- becasue it was active under clearXchange ... .which I was told is the same as Zelle, but becasue the same email address was active with clearXchange- i could not make it active with Zelle. It is important to note that on each of these phone calls the agents verified my account and could see both my Zelle and clearXchange information. So these differing and not useful instructions seemed odd.

I called one last time and stonewalled. The agent told me that clearXchange was the same company as Zellle- but he had no idea where the cash was or how long it would take to reach me. He literally just kept saying I apologize but it will be 3 business days. I asked why- he said the same thing. He told me that if I had deactivated the clearXchange email connection prior to the transfer them money would have gone through Zelle. I asked him how a person would know that- he did not answer. 
All three agents told me that could see the transaction- but could not give me any information on the process or the ETA of the deposit. They all said they could not expedite the process, and claimed no knowledge of why it would take so long for an electronic transfer through a quick-pay app. 
I believe that this money transfer app is exploiting loopholes to hold onto customer 's cash for longer than expected. Each agent told me something different, and said they had no information on a transaction passing through their interface- and could not access any information on it. They would just keep repeating themselves- regardless of the question. I am now not able to get the cash for days- and the whole process is useless, I would have been in the same position had I not used Zelle/clearXchange. I would be in a far better position if I had used another service- or if all the different qualifiers for "" quick '' payment had been disclosed."
Vehicle loan or lease,"I am in the process of refinancing a loan through BMW Financial Services NA , LLC, of XXXX, IL. They have not adequately provided the needed data for me to pay off my loan, and are unwillingly forcing me into late payments, debt collection, and credit report impacts. 

XX/XX/2019 : Vehicle purchased and loan initiated for {$20000.00}. 

XX/XX/2019 : Loan payoff letter received for {$20000.00} + {$2.00} per day past XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/2019 : Initiated loan with local federal credit union. Check created for {$20000.00}. 

XX/XX/2019 : Check mailed via USPS Certified Mail at XXXX XXXX, tracking number XXXX XX/XX/2019 : Check arrived in XXXX at XXXX XXXX  per USPS tracker. 

XX/XX/2019 : 3 minute phonecall. After not seeing the check register to my account, I called BMW Financial Services. They instructed me that they have not received any check, and to talk to my bank to see if it was cashed. 

XX/XX/2019, 13 minute phonecall. I called back and informed BMW Financial Services that my bank confirmed the check was not cashed. They would not instruct me any further, so I informed them that I would like to have my bank resend the same check. I also informed them that I would like this late payment to not be reported to credit bureaus. They agreed. 

XX/XX/2019 : 45 minutes added to commute home to visit credit union and gather lost-check form. Emailed form to BMW through their web portal and asked that they return it back. Was informed that they would "" We have submitted the attached form to our Accounting Team for review and research. If they are able to complete the request, they will forward it to [ credit union ] ''. When I asked when I could expect this to occur, I was provided with a generic response about my past-due balance ( which was past-due because my check was lost ). 

XX/XX/2019, 35 minute phonecall. I spoke with a very competent representative. He gladly jumped into the situation, spoke with the accounting team at BMW Financial Services, and informed me that the form would be sent back within the hour. True to his word, I received an email copy of the form. 

XX/XX/2019 : 6 minute phonecall with my credit union. I was informed by my credit union that I needed a wet signature copy, and it would have to be mailed. 

XX/XX/2019, 38 minute phonecall. I called back to the BMW FS and was greeted by the same generic debt collection lines. When I tried to explain my situation, they kept repeating the same questions. They asked for the check # that I had told them on several prior phonecalls. They asked me to hold for accounting, which they had done on several prior phonecalls. At the end of the phonecall around XXXX, I was told that "" nobody from accounting is in the office any more, you will have to call back on Monday after XXXX XXXX ''. I asked them how there wasn't anyone withing BMW FS Accounting that could mail a form, and they could not answer, again reiterating that I should call back Monday. I informed them that I could not call during work hours on Monday and that I was very disappointed they would not take initiative to provide paperwork supporting a payoff check that I was trying to provide. At this point I asked to speak with a manager. I was informed that there is no manager, and that I could be sent to the escalation service desk. I was forwarded to escalation services, and then hung up after 15 minutes after nobody answered. 

XX/XX/2019 : 43 minute phonecall. I initiated this phonecall with the BMW Salesman from who I purchased my car. He understood my situation and offered to set up a 3-way call to resolve the issue. He explained the issue to the BMW FS representative, who then reached out to me and stated "" I hear you're looking to refinance '', clearly not grasping that I was already in the process and trying to process the check. After asking repeatedly for this form to be completed and mailed, he offered to forward us to another department. The other department answered, and we again went through the same process. We again asked for the form to be sent. We were placed on hold for roughly 10 minutes. The BMW FS Associate returned and stated that the form can be mailed, and would arrive in 7-10 business days. I mentioned that this is unacceptable and it should be overnighted. I mentioned that BMW FS would claim I had past-due payments within 10 days, but provide a form for me to provide them with a full payoff check, after which I would still have to process with my credit union and send the second check back to BMW FS. When we asked about overnighting, we were told it would not be possible. The BMW FS Associate then mentioned that she would go confirm an address, and was again on hold for over 10 minutes. At this point I had to drop off the call, and I am unsure of the resolution she informed to my original vehicle Sales Rep."

Debt collection,"Regarding Acct. # XXXX My ex-husband and I have been dealing with US Bank for over 15 years managing and paying an Equiline account on time each month. Once we received our divorce in XXXX the bank would not divide the loan in half because he retired in XXXX and I was still working so our attorneys told us both to pay one half the bill each month. The account has matured and we are no longer able to draw funds on it and the bill has gone from approximately {$600.00} to {$1300.00} per month. 

We are both unable to make this {$680.00} payment each month and the bank has encouraged us to refinance. For some strange reason we were not able to refinance with a conventional loan so they suggested we go through Loss Mitigation. We have sent in application packets with requested documents from XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX but they refuse to approve this loan. To make things worse, they have assigned a different Relationship Manager ( RM ) every month or so causing more confusion. 

We have had XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and now XXXX. They rarely answer the telephone when you call and when they do they won't give any concrete answers about the application status and they have never told me exactly what documents they did receive from us. They continue to ask for more and more documents from us starting from scratch. During one phone call XXXX thought my house was attached to this Equiline account when actually it is the house that my ex-husband lives in. I know I have sent in the documents requested because I have scanned them and sent them from the Public Library and it provided a scanned copy for my file. Another time I sent them from one of the local US Bank branches. I asked the RM there to look over the packet to make sure I had everything included but she would not do it ; she said she was not allowed to do so. However ; a week prior, I was there and she encouraged me to come back anytime I need their help. 

US Bank has exemplified poor customer service, discriminatory loan practices, unprofessional and unethical business etiquette in the 21st  Century. I am appalled and there is no excuse for it. I have also experienced several other issues with US Bank regarding other account I have with them. I do not want to get into those issues right now. I want them to be accountable for this unacceptable behavior.

Mortgage,"Please advise as to how I can escalate my complaint against Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. I had been current for 36 months in a row when I was laid off of my job. I contacted Wells Fargo immediately and was told about a deferred payment plan. I agreed to enroll in the plan in XXXX and was told not to make any payments until the enrollment process completed. In XXXX, I was sent the paperwork for the program and noticed that all deferred payment would become due immediately at the conclusion of the program. This was not told to me initially back in XXXX. However, at this point, I was now over 2 months behind on my mortgage. I was advised by Wells Fargo Home Mortgage not to worry, enroll in the program, and when it concluded we would apply for a loan modification to address the deferred amount. I did as advised but then, due to the glitch in Wells Fargo 's software, was told that I didnt have sufficient income to qualify. I knew that had to be incorrect and appealed time after time, only to receive the same answer. Finally, my house went into foreclosure. Because of this glitch in their software, I have lost my home along with many other homeowners. I have filed complaints and written many letters but no one has helped. I filed a complaint with you and Wells Fargo supposedly did an investigation. Their response was that they can not do anything to correct the situation because my house was sold in a foreclosure sale. That is exactly my complaint. Wells Fargo unlawfully sold my home and now says nothing can be done because they sold my home. How do I escalate my complaint to a Federal agency that can actually do something in regards to my situation?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I spoke to a Chase representative on XX/XX/XXXX at the bank branch ( in XXXX area ) about a balance transfer interest charge ( {$10.00} ), that has occurred monthly in slightly varying amounts. He learned from the Chase AARP representative that the charge goes back to at least XX/XX/XXXX, and they would further investigate. 

Upon request, I received the XX/XX/XXXX statement ( most recent statement ) in paper form dated XX/XX/XXXX. I also received 2 letters ( attached ) from AARP Chase which do not clarify the situation. They mention amounts of {$100.00} and {$700.00}, that are NOT explained clearly. 

It seems to me that computer statements have lost some of the specificity of paper statements of the past. I can not imagine paying off a debt at {$10.00} monthly over the course of ten years. I would never have chosen such an option. I do not recall the original transaction.

Credit card,"I was stupid enough to charge some items at MACY 'S on my Macy 's credit card over XXXX. I was unable to log into my account online to make the payment because Macy 's had updated the system and I simply did n't have the patience to navigate their irritating and obscure system. However, I called Macy 's and paid my bill for $ XXXX a day or two late - was assured that there would be no late charges because I was a customer in good standing, yada yada, and received a confirmation number that I had paid the bill in full. 

I then received a bill for {$2.00} in interest. OK, I agree - I had n't paid the {$140.00} on time, regardless of the reason. Whatever. So I paid that {$2.00} bill immediately, by check, and left the country for an extended absence - in complete confidence that I had paid all my bills in full. 

Imagine my surprise when I returned to the US and found that Macy 's had received and cashed my check, but charged me a further {$2.00} anyway as a minimum interest charge on the interest charge that had been paid in full, well before the due date. Oh, and then added a further minimum {$2.00} charge for a total of {$4.00}, due on XXXX. 

I called Macy 's right away and spoke to one XXXX, who did n't seem to have a clue why I was irritated, but eventually - very grudgingly and with full implication that I was a total deadbeat - agreed that she would "" waive '' the {$4.00}. 

Imagine my FURTHER surprise when I received a FURTHER email from Macy 's about my "" account balance. '' I immediately called, went through endless voice prompts, and finally got through to a live human being who said in hushed tones that she 'd have to put me through to another department. 

Sure enough, I got the "" this is an attempt to collect a debt '' speech. The glorious XXXX, according to the faultlessly polite CS rep who answered, had failed to properly credit my account. He agreed that he could correct it and that my account would update eventually to show a {$0.00} balance. However, he was unable to reassure me that this, um, "" delinquency '' had not been reported to the credit bureaux that make a darn good living off selling my info, and he could not send me a letter saying that Macy 's had made a mistake. Given that the glorious XXXX had also assured me that I had a {$0.00} balance on my Macy 's charge card, forgive me if I 'm not confident that I do in fact now have a {$0.00} balance. 

I do not give a flying whatever about my credit as I am old and cranky and do n't need any credit. I DO care that Macy 's total incompetence and the Macy 's system that is set up to fail, to their benefit and to consumers ' detriment, affects kids and other people who DO need good credit."

Student loan,"I'm being charged interest on subsidized loans despite being in school for 6 straight years and currently being in grace period until XX/XX/XXXX. Nelnet says my schooling isn't reported as multiple programs over 6 years and the NSLDS website shows my max term for SULA was 1.5 years. I completed my XXXX XXXX degree in 4.5 years, with SULA i should have had up to 6 years ( 150 % of the length of the program ). Then immediately went to grad school with loans in deferment. I reached out to both Nelnet and my university in XX/XX/XXXX and was told there's nothing that can be done. My school showed me they reported my degrees correctly, Nelnet won't give me any information other than that my subsidy was lost after a year and a half ( so this would've been in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX ) meaning I've been being charged interest on about 6 loans for 4 or 5 years."
Mortgage,I purchased an FHA home 2 years and I was told that my loan is assumable. When I contacted Rushmore loans they told me that they don't do assumable loans and that FHA doesn't do assumable loans. They called XXXX and told me that i could call XXXX and they would tell me that FHA doesn't do assumable loans. When i contacted them they said they don't know why they would say that then they gave me me FHAs phone number. I'm looking to have someone assume my loan because I'm moving out of state and I'm told they don't do that.

I have attempted to send them payment to resolve the debt and they are refusing to provide information on the debt amount, and payment remittance address.

I requested a letter that they would remove the debt with payment in full, they refused and sent me to a website with generic information.

Since they have filed that XXXX I am no longer responsible for this debt. It shows that I owe {$17000.00}, but when I called them they stated I owed {$10000.00} and that they have already resold the car. So that means they have resold the car, filed it as a loss with the IRS, but are still pursuing me for debt. They've dinged my credit report every month since XXXX causing my credit to be damaged. When I called them to tell them what the IRS told me the first representative hung up, and I had to call back. The second representative told me that all he could do was file a complaint with the complaint department and it could take them a week to respond to me. I'm closing on a home in a few days and this is so unprofessional, illegal, and unfair. That is tax evasion! They have harassed me for year about this debt and have been reporting incorrectly!"
Mortgage,"My complaint is with LOANCARE A SERVICELINK COMPANY, this complaint starts back to XX/XX/2018, after Hurricane Michael had destroyed my condo in XXXX XXXX FL, I took the right steps in notifying them right away that the property was destroyed and I asked them what my next steps should be. They told me they would put a forbearance on my account for 3 months, at the time I thought this would be enough time for me to receive my insurance checks and payoff my mortgage because the HOA voted to not rebuild the condos. Once the 3 months was up I informed them that I was still waiting for a 3rd insurance check to pay off the mortgage in full. LOANCARE told me that there was nothing they could do and expected me to make an XXXX mortgage payment on a property that was destroyed, after I had to move, find a new job and place to live. I told them I could not do this and asked them to wait a few weeks for the last insurance check. They did not, and started attacking my credit with a 75 point deduction every month that it was late. When I finally received the 3rd insurance check, I Noticed that the check was made out to the wrong mortgage company ; it was made out to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the mortgage company I originally bought the mortgage from, they then sold the lean on the property to LOANCARE. I was told by the XXXX XXXX ( where the property is located ) Clerk of court that the records have to be updated by the mortgage company that they own the lean on that land. ( you are supposed to do this when a mortgage company transfers to another, but it was not done ) So the HOA Trust fund can cut me a new check with the updated mortgage company. I have been calling countless time to inform them of this to no avail. They just transfer me back and forth between their insurance department and mortgage department. Telling me they have no idea who deals with that or they will do it and then nothing happens, I then call back, and they act like they never even heard from me in the first place. At the same time they pile more and more late fees, interest, onto the payoff statement. It has been 6 months since Hurricane Michael. I have the means to pay it off in full but they will not do their part."
Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from chase bank in response for a new debit card. I called chase bank customer Sevice and advised them that I received such an email and chase bank ask me to go personally to the branch to report any fraud. On that same day I went to XXXX branch of chase and spoke to an employee named XXXX and he let me spoke to fraud Dept and just advise me to forward the email to XXXX and stated I dont have to do anything. 
On XX/XX/XXXX when I checked my balance my two accounts both checking and saving account was withdrawn in the amount of XXXX XXXX from checking and XXXX from savings Acct. I called chase bank as soon as I found out and filed a dispute about the incident. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I also went to XXXX chase branch to complain and informed them that there were two withdrawals and we found out that transactions were occurred at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, nj. On that day The funds were returned temporarily. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from chase indicating that the funds thats were returned has been reversed and that chase bank claimed that the withdrawals were made with a chipped card and the return would not be honored. I called the claim dept about this matter but unfortunately they just told me that the card will be impossible to be tampered since its a chip to chip basis. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to go to the police station and report the incident because my Savings account turned all into negative. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I recieved a final report from the assigned detective for my case and he exhibited a report based from the video surveillance as an evidence that it was not me who withdrawn the money. I sent The report to chase claim department on that same day but unfortunately the case was still denied and did not honor the report. At this time chase bank has been charging me of XXXX dollars fee for not maintaining the balance and on top of this my checking and savings account are currently negative. 
I am sending this letter to your office to let you know and asking for help since I am a victim of this criminal case and that chase bank has never honored all my evidence since I had received the email despite all the eveidence I had provided. I do believe that my case was not investigated in thouroughly and in a fair manner. Chase bank should have the reponsibility to protect Their consumers. I do believe this is negligence on the part of chase bank by giving my information to this thief without asking proper identification and without giving me proper notifications. 
I am asking for your assistance in this matter and I am hoping that I will have justice in this case. 
Thank you and have a blessed new year Sincerely yours XXXX XXXX"
Debt collection,"XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, has not honored my cease and desist telephone communications requests. Several times in XX/XX/2019 specifically, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, I had rather intimidating and belittling phone calls with a representative ( Id # XXXX ), who used demeaning and aggressive language towards me. On one of the calls, she instructed me to get a prepaid card ( on which I would accrue monthly fees ) in order to make a payment and when I asked her if there were any other options available to me, she reiterated that if I did not make a payment within 30 days of receiving the notice of wage withholding, my wages would be garnished through an administrative garnishment. 


Under the threat of an administrative garnishment, not having the money, feeling belittled by XXXX, and based on the threatening and condescending manner with which they spoke to me, I purchased a prepaid card in order to make the payment and enter into an arrangement for subsequent monthly deductions from the card. XXXX collected money from me in order to execute the agreement. However, on the same day that I made the payment, prior to providing XXXX with my card information, I requested that they provide me proof that I owe the debt because I could not find documentation it based on a review of my personal records. 


Today, XX/XX/2019 I again received several calls from a number that XXXX called from onXX/XX/2019. On the XX/XX/2019 call, I told the representative that I requested that they stop calling me a few months ago and that I only wanted letter communications. Also, todayXX/XX/2019, XXXX sent me an email about the debt. It has become unbearable. 


Also, I spoke with XXXX, the federal student loan servicer, to ask if XXXX  was collecting on their behalf and the XXXX   representative said "" no, '' which increased my suspicion of XXXX   XXXX began each call with me by stating that "" they've been hired by XXXX '' to collect, which caused me a lot of stress. 


I ask that all the calls connected to the account on which XXXX is attempting to collect be reviewed. In those calls, you'll find evidence that : - I requested that XXXX  not call me ; - My communications with XXXX reps were abusive ; - XXXX reps deceptively represented to me that they were hired by XXXX  to collect the debt ; - XXXX used the threat of garnishment to take a payment from me before providing me proof that I owned the loan ; and - XXXX may have committed other violations of consumer protection laws and infringed on any rights granted to me under those laws."
Debt collection,In or on approximately 2016 t I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX got a loan. I went into store and paid off the accout with my bank which was fXXXX XXXX XXXX checking account .i notice that the company went to debit recovery solutions for collecting the pat due amount. In the month of XXXX XXXXthe have accesses my credit file 3 times in one month. I called bank to get the information with no response from them. I have a witness to this effect that we walked into XXXX XXXX XXXX and paid off the loan. From and to my understanding it is illegal to hit someone credit report more than once in any given time period
Mortgage,I make my mortgage payment every month through my bank accounts online billpay service and have done so for years. I typically pay my mortgage payment early. My statements started reflecting that I was behind a few months ago. I made several calls and sent emails but Lakeview Loan Servicing has still failed to post the missing payment. I sent screenshots of my XXXX XXXX  account as well as the confirmation number from the billpay service. Recently I went to XXXX where they researched the payment and provided a debit trace number which I have now also sent to Lakeview Loan Servicing. The payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$1800.00} and was for my XX/XX/XXXX mortgage payment. I made another payment using the same method for my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX and Lakeview received that and posted it as my XXXX payment. I have made my payments the same way for years and never had this issue before. The debit trace number provided by XXXX is XXXX. Lakeview has been mostly non-responsive and emailed me that my issue was resolved after my XXXX mortgage payment was received and posted by them.

Can you  provide me with the contact number and name of the person you talked to? My attorney told me that your company use third party data mining companies to get information from the court? Is that true? If that is the case, then your company is really not doing a true investigation is that correct.

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Citi reported my account was 30 days past due on XX/XX/2019. The account was not past due. The information was inaccurate and retaliatory due to complaints filed to the CFPB in response to practices by Citi Cards. The link on the XXXX  website is not working to submit an online claim.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",I submitted a request to investigate personal information as well as accounts I did not recognize on my XXXX  report. I sent in identifying documents such as drivers license and SSN card. I received a letter saying they were not going to reinvestigate my claims and they sent me a copy of my credit report with the same information reporting incorrectly. They also asked for me to send in ID and SSN In order to effectively handle my dispute however I had already originally sent the SSN and Drivers license in with the original dispute which leads me to think they never viewed or investigated any of my concerns instead they just sent an automated rebuttal letter refusing to fix the errors they are reporting on my credit.
Mortgage,"I have filed complaint after complaint with you, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau dealing with Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ), and for some reason, you think it is sufficient if they simply respond to the complaint. It doesn't matter if that response is a lie, or even illegal. This company and their parent company has been sued by, and have had complaint after complaint filed against them with the United States Government and the Department of Justice. XXXX XXXX has settled with the DOJ several times including this time XXXX XXXX Agrees to Pay {$5.00} XXXX in Connection with its Sale of XXXX XXXX XXXX. But yet, they continue with their same practices to foreclose on the homeowner. I received a modification in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX when they settled due to the guidelines placed by the Department of Justice. But shortly after, they raised my mortgage by {$200.00}. Then I received another notice in XXXX that they are raising it again! I fell behind and tried and tried for modification and no help. They receive credit from the Department of Justice, but they don't report that they turn around and raise those rates back up behind the DOJ 's back, claiming escrow shortage. My insurance and taxed did not increase by {$400.00} in the last two years. I have paperwork for proof. The DOJ gives credit for this? Even though it's misleading? You continue to let this company illegally take homes and do business in the U.S. when  you know what they are doing is illegal. If you didn't think it was illegal, why file complaint after complaint against them. And for whatever reason you settle. I am a single mother who was caught up in the XXXX housing crisis. I was taken advantage of then, and continue to be by SPS. Never mind the fact that the assignment claim they filed on my property was filed 2 years after it was supposedly signed. And the supposed manager on the account was never a manager. She is willing to testify in court on my behalf. They continue and repeatedly say that my note holder is XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX, but when you contact them, they have no knowledge of me or my loan, or my SSN. No information regarding me. During the crisis those mortgage assignment and securities where under scrutiny and had a complaint filed against them for those same practices! They have no record of me. And they fraudulently send this through USPS mail knowing it's a lie. How is that not a federal crime? They continue to say that I have a relationship team manager. Virginia has yet to call me! I have yet to talk with her. She is never available. It is always someone else calling me from SPS. They call at XXXX while I'm at work. And if I don't answer, there is a note on my door saying they are trying to get a hold of me. Never mind the fact that I just talked to them the day before. And they will charge a few for that saying they are trying to locate me. Tell me why they continue to do this, when there is a currently lawsuit against them by another client ( I won't include his name ) for the exact same practice. Why does the XXXX Government let them get away with what they do? They are doing the same practices that led to the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX housing crash and crisis. I'm a victim that struggles to keep her home due to XXXX 's practices. They offered a repayment plan that was triple my original mortgage rate for 12 months! That they claim is to bring me current. How would you expect me to afford a {$1400.00} mortgage payment for when I tried to modify from the near {$900.00} payment they bumped it up to, due to "" escrow '' shortages? I do not want a big packet in the mail from SPS regarding this matter. I want the truth and that's it. They repeatedly threaten with foreclosure to get someone out of their home. If you, the cfbp would look back at the complaints ... how is that so many consumers have the exact same complaint about the same company and you do nothing about! I have not received anything regarding their decision to not modify, of when they discussed anything w/ my lender or not holder. Does a SPS make those decisions on their own? Why is there never a representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the courtroom? If SPS wants the home, then I'm sure they will find a way to take it. They have yet to explain to me why my {$700.00} payment was not posted from XX/XX/XXXX. The latest court filings and none of them actually, because they have tried to foreclose numerous times, contains the same paper work attached. It's always different. The assignment is in some and not in all. The loan amounts are different. The loan number and account numbers aren't always consistent. It's a sham and SPS, The DOJ,  & the cfpb all know it. But with the current president, banks and creditors can do whatever they please to the consumer with no consequences. As long as they make their money. I have even attached that document to my complaint with you all before. One representative said since it had redaction that they couldn't take it. I do not have to show SPS my full bank statement. They only need to see payments to them, and my income. They never even asked for income which increased by over $ XXXX/month in their latest denial for assistance. Legally they are supposed to show the numbers that they used. The denial only showed where they pulled comps in my area. There was no income calculated. No communication between the holder and SPS which is necessary by law. No true NPV calculated. No explanation of how much cash flow my investor would receive from a modification verses a foreclosure. To say I'm terrified for myself and my children is an understatement. Select Portfolio Servicing please do not send me another huge packet in the mail. Electronic will suffice."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I did a volunteer repossession of a vehicle that I was to purchase around about XX/XX/XXXX. The company XXXX XXXX XXXX sent a letter informing me that they were going to sell the vehicle as a private sale on or about XX/XX/XXXX. I decided to start getting my credit in order and saw that XXXX XXXX XXXX reported me to all 3 of the major Credit Bureau as owing {$15000.00}. I went into this loan agreement in XX/XX/XXXX for that amount. I sent notice to all 3 credit reporting agency and to XXXX XXXX XXXX to have it removed from my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by all 3 credit reporting agency that they verified that account belongs to me, and will not remove the derogatory remark. I after not receiving any response from XXXX XXXX XXXX I sent a second letter on XX/XX/XXXX to all 3 credit reporting agency and XXXX XXXX XXXX send me a copy of a contract bearing my signature and, I received nothing from Santander Consumer USA again. I received once again a letter from all 3 credit reporting agency stating this is my account. I then sent a third letter on XX/XX/XXXX giving them 15 days to send me proof of what XXXX XXXX XXXX sent them to prove this is my account. I received nothing again. So, I sent a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX asking them to send me what they sent to the credit reporting agency, once again they failed to respond. I have tried my best to get this resolved but XXXX XXXX XXXX refuses to speak or open a line of communication with me. My last and final attempt before contacting you was a letter sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX was to provide me proof of the sale and the amount once again no response. I see that on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  charge-off my account then on XX/XX/XXXX the amount was {$11000.00} they continue to add the payment amount of {$420.00} each month unit they got to the amount of {$15000.00} my question how is that possible when you have already charged my account off?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have complained several times before to try and get some assistance with this issue. I have received several letters from XXXX  stating that this public record that is reporting is accurate. This public record is not accurate and I have contacted both the courthouse and XXXX XXXX, which is who the company has told me has verified my public record. 

This is a blatant lie and a true misrepresentation of my credit report and my husbands credit report and I want this removed ASAP. I am tired of continously having to fight for my innocence in this situation."
Credit card or prepaid card,"On XX/XX/2019, I applied online through XXXX XXXX via XXXX for a Chase Freedom credit card, which immediately showed up in my XXXX credit file as a hard inquiry. More than a week later on XX/XX/2019, I received a reply from Chase in the form of a secure message through my online account with the merchant ( I have two existing credit cards with the merchant, a Chase Slate and Chase AARP credit card ) requesting that I phone in to verify that the application was submitted by me. I responded the same day with a secure message through my online account indicating that the application was indeed submitted by me, but chase repeatedly insisted that this would not suffice and that I would need to phone in. I indicated yesterday that since the request to verify my identity was made through my online account, it should also be possible to process my identity verification there, and that I wanted the hard inquiries Chase made to my credit files removed if this were not the case. Chase responded today via another secure message by once again requesting that I phone in."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",As you can see i have complained about this company 8 times this will be the ninth. Let 's go back to complaints 1 through 7. As you can see they had verified proof that I lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Guess what the street the address does n't even exist. It was till I did my own research on XXXX XXXX  that I found the street or the address did not exist. Again now after complaints 7 and 8 they are saying I lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as verified proof again this is completely FALSE and misleading information!!! Again let me STRESS I want to be crystal clear. lexis nexis stated on 5 different occasions I lived at an address that does n't even exist!!!! Now they are claiming again as verified proof I lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Let me tell you for the 9th time this is FALSE AND MISLEADING information. Again I want to point ot 5 times they said i lived at an address that does not exist. So again I did some homework and guess what the home at the time belonged to a XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX.. Not XXXX XXXX . please have this corrected ASAP. They are providing FALSE AND MISLEADING INFORMATION.
Credit card or prepaid card,"I was charged with unauthorized use/fraudulent charge on my Chase Freedom credit card by XXXX XXXX CT and XXXX XXXX CT accrued from XXXX to XXXX. I discovered the transactions and reported to XXXX Credit Card Fraud operations in XXXX, XXXX. The researched and credited the unauthorized charges on all transactions from XXXX. I sent them the claim letters on XX/XX/XXXX on the all unauthorized charges occurred during XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. 
The total payment I made on their unauthorized charges is {$1400.00}. After I researched, I found the following unauthorized charges from them started back to XX/XX/XXXX, from then on they charged my credit card {$15.00} and {$8.00} separated each month. I did not authorize or used any of their services, merchandises nor any form of service. I never received any billing, invoices, receipt nor statement from them. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX, their representative told me they could find my account."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","An account with Greensky Trade Credit , LLC XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, GA was established for financing a home repair project via XXXX. I never received a bill for the completed project therefore, I had to personally contact the establishment to inquire. During my telephone conversation with Greensky, I was directly told the specific reason was directly due to an improper mailing address. They further stated that the correspondences had been returned to them a period of five months had elapsed. XXXX financed the project via Greensky. Therefore, there are two addresses listed on all documents. There are a physical address of the property and are my mailing address. These addresses were established at the initially from the onset of financing the construction. I repeatedly asked a representative of the company during my conversation with her why an invoice had not been sent. She justified action due to an incorrect mailing address. Prior to ending the conversation, I was told that an invoice would be mailed. To date, I have still not received the documents. A day after my conversation with the company representative I received an email alert notification of an adverse thirty-day delinquent credit report. In addition, a second adverse repot was listed on my credit report. An individual from the company whom identified as XXXX telephoned and left me a voice message in references to the account. The voice message directed me to return the telephone call. Upon retrieving the message I immediately returned the call. However, I did not speak with XXXX directly but another representative. I provided the reason I was calling and an email for any additional communications. The representative assured me that the message would be relayed and I left a voice message to ensure full communication of the issue. The company still refuses to provide me an invoice and any additional documents but they are being allowed to submit two adverse thirty-day delinquent credit reports."
Credit card or prepaid card,"There's a common practice with credit card companies that affect people with money problems. 

1. they offer a balance transfer if you open a new card. 
2. they ask you how much you make per year. ( without any evidence, people can lie and inflate their income ) 3. the company accepts your application and balance transfer. The promotional period is generous- around 13 months in this case ( Bank of America platinum ). 

4. After the promotional period, the rate rises to 24 %. This is a loan shark rate that is impossible to pay back for most middle- low-middle class people. 

5. HERE 'S THE KICKER : After approving your application, mailing your card, emailing an announcement that your card has been mailed, they delay the balance transfer payment to the other card TWO WEEKS. Your balance remains at XXXX for two weeks. 

This practice ( mailing the card, delaying the balance transfer and keeping your full credit line open at {$0.00} ), is designed to lure people into using their card for purchases. 

This is TWO WEEKS where people who don't understand the rules make purchases at a 24 % rate. It's even possible that the balance transfer might exceed their credit line when it is posted/processed if they've used their card during this two weeks. After the balance transfer is complete, they can not begin to pay off the balance transfer until they pay the balance for the purchases made earlier. This increases the likelihood that their balance will lapse into the non-promotional rate. 

This is predatory, manipulative, and deceitful. THERE SHOULD BE A LAW PROHIBITING THIS TWO WEEK DELAY. It's obviously an intentional way to take advantage of financially unaware or desperate people and lure them into using their card."
Debt collection,"I received a voicemail on Monday XX/XX/XXXX from an "" XXXX '' claiming that I had 2 civil complaints against me and that I would be served papers that week. I called the number she left in the voicemail and reached CRS and XXXX. XXXX XXXX took the call. He stated the call was being recorded and to let him finish before speaking or asking questions. He said that I owed a debt from XX/XX/2005 from XXXX XXXX  and that I would be receiving a court summons regarding a theft and fraud investigation. He claimed that I had 3 options : 1 ) To go to court and be responsible for the judgment and court costs 2 ) make payments or 3 ) pay off at a discount and avoid the court. The call occurred during my work shift and created unnecessary panic and anxiety. I gave my debit card number to avoid a court record and was sent and email to sign papers to authorize payment. After the call ended and I calmed down, I performed research on CRS and associated and found many reports of scamming and predatory tactics to collect old debt. I called the court system in my local county as  well as XXXX XXXX and had enough information that this was not legitimate. On XX/XX/XXXX, CRS withdrew {$490.00} without my signed authorization. I called Mr. XXXX to confront him with the situation and call him out with the information I had obtained. He continued to dispute the information XXXX XXXX ( the institution where the debt is owed ) gave me before cutting me off and asking what I wanted. I stated that I want the funds returned to my bank account since I did not sign the papers authorizing them to withdraw. He was going to hang up on me before I could ask when the money would be deposited. He stated today ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I called XXXX XXXX  to confirm the original information I received. I called Mr. XXXX back and stated once again the facts and called him out on the lies. He said "" the money had already been refunded and to stop calling. '' He hung up on me. The funds were not returned."
Student loan,"I have tried several times to refinance my student loans that are currently being serviced by Navient. Despite having a credit score above XXXX, and no late payments on any other debt accounts, except for loans serviced by Navient, I am routinely denied refinancing by banks, other servicers, XXXX, XXXX, etc. I have spoken with the team at XXXX as well, and they advised that I contact Navient directly, and request they remove previous late payment marks as it is over 3+ years old ( or provide in writing that I am no longer delinquent ), due to my current good standing. I have explained the situation on several occasions ( XX/XX/XXXX, and most recently XX/XX/XXXX ), and despite XXXX  saying Navient has the right/ ability to remove these late marks, Navient refuses to do so, fully acknowledging that they have trapped me into paying them, and not being able to refinance. I feel that I am being unfairly treated as well as subjected to indentured servitude by Navient. My loans are currently at an average interest rate of XXXX % ( ranging from XXXX - XXXX  % ). XXXX has told me that the WORST rate I would be offered would be XXXX  %, and most likely closer to XXXX %. This is outright usury and would be illegal in any other short-term lending, or housing loan! I have paid them over XXXX to date on a XXXX principal loan, and currently have a remaining balance of XXXX. I am simply seeking to refinance with a better lender/ creditor/ servicer. As a customer I do not believe this is too much to ask for! XXXX NAVIENT!"
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan","Over the course of about a year and a half, I got into the awful, perpetual cycle of a payday loan. I am mortified and deeply ashamed that I did so. It was a definite low point. The problem with these predatory lenders is those of us who find ourselves in a life situation that causes the desperation to even consider such an option then become trapped in the cycle. These predatory lenders charge such outrageous fess that you can not get out of the cycle of debt. This happened to me. I want others to not face the same situation and I want to fight back against one of these predatory lenders, WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX. 
I believed I had resolved my issues with WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  last spring/summer. On Wednesday, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, my cell phone rang once with a number I did not recognize. I called it back and the individual who answered never identified the company and simply said Hello. I said, I received a call from this number. He said, Well, you actually called me which I did not. I asked whom I was speaking to and he said XXXX XXXX. I assumed it was a call to entice me into another predatory loan, so I hung up. Much to my surprise, this individual ( whom I have since learned is named XXXX XXXX ) called my work number and left a message stating he would email me with a new offer. 
I received the email titled Settlement Offer. In it, Mr. XXXX stated WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  would be willing to establish payments for the {$1000.00} I owe. I do not owe {$1000.00}. The offer claimed to be giving me a 30 % discount off my loan and with the discount, my amount due would be {$1000.00}. So with 30 % added, Mr. XXXX was claiming I owe {$1300.00}!!!!! This is fraudulent information. This is another predatory, harassing, threatening tactic these horrific payday loan lenders try to extort money from vulnerable people. The offer went on to say that if I pay the {$1000.00}, I could get a new loan within 5 business days of its payment!!!! Absolutely outrageous! Completely predatory! 
As much as it pains me to do so because I feel so utterly foolish and XXXX, I will outline my history with WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX. While I ultimately made the decision to enter into business with this predatory lender, it is critical that the authorities see the complete picture of the spiral and cycle of greed, predatory actions and harassment I experienced. I am mortified and deeply embarrassed that I was in a position where I turned to this predatory, abusive, borderline illegal payday loan lender. To now fight back against them is so difficult as I must again face the deep seeded embarrassment I feel. 
WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX has receive an OBSCENE amount of money from me. They must cease and desist and for once mark my account CLOSED IN GOOD STANDING!!!! WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX actually owes me money if we want to break it down. Per South Carolina ( my state of residence ) payday loan regulations, I should have only been charged $ XXXX/ {$100.00} borrowed. It was based on those terms that my account was placed as PAID/CLOSED/IN GOOD STANDING with Mr. XXXX, Collections Manager for WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX in spring/summer XXXX. 
Here is a breakdown of my XXXX and WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  greed : In XX/XX/XXXX, I borrowed {$800.00} and repaid a total of {$1400.00} for that {$800.00} loan. WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received the {$800.00} back plus profited {$630.00} from me on that loan. Based on the {$15.00} per {$100.00} borrowed, which is South Carolinas payday loan regulation, I should have only paid {$120.00} for this loan. WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  hides behind its tribal affiliation to justify its greed. Given I should have only paid back a total of {$920.00} and given WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received {$1400.00}, I paid {$510.00} more than I should have. 
As I stated, predatory lending creates a cycle. My financial upheaval was now additionally impacted because I paid {$630.00} in fees on an {$800.00} loannearly double!! I paid 125 % in fees!!! 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I then borrowed {$650.00} and repaid a total of {$1800.00}!!!!!!!!! WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received the {$650.00} back plus profited {$1100.00} from me on that loan. Based on the {$15.00} per {$100.00} borrowed, I should have only paid {$97.00} for this loan. Given I should have only paid back a total of {$740.00} and given WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received {$1800.00}, I paid {$1000.00} more than I should have. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I then borrowed {$400.00} and repaid a total of {$790.00}!!!!!!!!! WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received the {$400.00} back plus profited {$390.00} from me. I should have only paid {$60.00} for this loan. Given I should have only paid back a total of {$460.00} and given WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX received {$790.00}, I paid {$330.00} more than I should have. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I borrowed {$600.00} and repaid a total of {$750.00}!!!!!!!!! WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received the {$600.00} back plus profited {$150.00} from me. I should have only paid {$90.00} for this loan. Given I should have only paid back a total of {$690.00} and given WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX received {$750.00}, I paid {$66.00} more than I should have. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I borrowed {$1000.00} and repaid a total of {$1200.00}!!!!!!!!! WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received the {$1000.00} back plus profited {$260.00} from me. I should have only paid {$150.00} for this loan. Given I should have only paid back a total of {$1100.00} and given WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX received {$1200.00}, I paid {$110.00} more than I should have. 
My final loan was in XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00} and I repaid a total of {$1000.00}. At that point, I filed a complaint and reached an agreement with WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  that my account would be CLOSED/PAID IN FULL/IN GOOD STANDING based on the outrageous amount of money WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  got out of me. 
For Mr. XXXX to now approach me nearly a year later and demand {$1000.00} is unfathomable. When I responded to him yesterday stating my account should be CLOSED/PAID IN FULL/IN GOOD STANDING, he stated WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  wants an additional {$260.00} from me. 
All totaled, WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received {$7100.00} in payments for the {$4400.00} I borrowed over the course of my foolish relationship with them. For all loans, I repaid the full balance PLUS WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  received an exorbitant profit. Less than {$4400.00} in loan amounts, they received {$2600.00} in fees. Per South Carolina payday loan regulations, I should have only been charged $ XXXX/ {$100.00} borrowed or {$660.00} for the {$4400.00} borrowed. WLCC d/b/a XXXX XXXX  collected {$1900.00} in excess of that. To now be threatening me to collect an additional {$1000.00} ( or even {$260.00} ) is OBSCENE, PREDATORY and DISGUSTING."

I changed insurance company XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX.and at the end of XXXX I cancelled my old policy with progressive and backdated the end date to XX/XX/XXXX, the new policy was in effect but it shows the start date was XX/XX/2017, which is a two day discrepancy. Fifth Third Bank contacted me and asked for proof of insurance. I inquired if the vehicle insurance card was acceptable and I was told yes. I sent the card and about a month later they contacted my a second time and asked for the declaration page. I sent that document to them also and they sent a letter stating that I owed them for two months of insurance because their record show I didn't have any so they place insurance on the vehicle. I provided them with insurance information and wrote a letter in an attempt to resolve this issue, they were rude on the phone and continuedly would tell me they didn't receive no letter or any information pertaining to proof of insurance. They are demanding {$710.00} for two months worth of forced insurance and are adding XXXX per month late fee even though I have proof that the vehicle was covered. Also they have adversely affected my credit by reporting late payments to all credit bureau causing my score to drop which has blocked my from acquiring new loans."

Checking or savings account,"On XX/XX/XXXX, {$2100.00} was withdrawn from my Citizen 's Bank account by someone else. I am a former refugee from that does not speak fluent English, so I got help from a service coordinator at a refugee services organization to deal with this issue. My service coordinator helped me call my bank, the FBI, and the Federal Trade Commission on XX/XX/XXXX. We filed an official FTC report on XX/XX/XXXX. We also contacted one of the credit bureaus, at the advice of the FBI and FTC, and set up a fraud alert through XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we went to the local police station to file a report, but they would not take my statement, saying they didn't have enough people that day to do it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a new bank account with Citizen 's so that I could have my direct deposit transferred and access my money ; all of my direct deposit money in my old account had been withdrawn. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, Citizen 's had refunded several purchases and overdraft fees that were caused by the other person accessing my bank account, but they still had not refunded the {$2100.00} that had been withdrawn. I received my new debit card on XX/XX/XXXX, but I never received a new PIN. By XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not received a new PIN, so my service coordinator helped me call Citizen 's to ask about the claim for the {$2100.00} and the PIN number. Over the phone, they told us there was no claim for my account and that we needed to go to a branch office to sort out this issue. I did receive my new PIN and was able to set up my direct deposit in my new account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, my service coordinator and I went to the local Citizen 's bank branch to find out about the claim issue. We discovered that someone else with my same name and almost same birthdate ( common in my community ) had requested an address change for his account, but they linked it to mine. That is why I had not received the PIN number. He is also the one that accessed my account. When I insisted to the bank staff that I had not changed my address and have lived in the same apartment since I came to the country, they at first denied that that was true. My service coordinator, who had picked me up at the airport upon my arrival to the US,  confirmed that it was true. He also explained that several people in my community have the same name and similar birthdates, estimating at least 4 or 5. She found 16 other accounts with my same name. 

Finally one of the staff helped to sign an affidavit stating that I did not change my address and that this withdrawal was the bank 's fault for not checking the identity properly, and she reopened the claim. When she printed the form out, it still had the other person 's address on it, so we corrected that as well. 

I received a form to sign on XX/XX/XXXX to say that my statement about what happened is true. I signed it, copied it, and gave it back to the bank. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received my refund for the {$2100.00}, but then two days later, they took the money back out of my account and claimed that they used video footage to determine it was me that withdrew the money. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested to see this video footage. They said it would take a few weeks to obtain and they would get back to me when they had it. 

I never heard from them, and in XX/XX/XXXX, I went back to a refugee services organization to get help again. I brought all my letters and bank statements, showing that I had not received anything notifying me of the video footage. On XX/XX/XXXX, we went to Citizen 's Bank, where one of the bankers helped me file a dispute for the decision they made. He talked with the fraud department and pointed out evidence from my account that two different people with two different SSNs and Tax IDs had accessed my account. He also sent the fraud department proof that the other person had deposited two large sums of money the day after the money was withdrawn from my own account. I signed the paper, and he submitted it to the claims department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they sent me a letter denying my second request, stating that they had evidence that I was the one who accessed the account to withdraw the money. On XX/XX/XXXX, my service coordinator went back with me to Citizen 's Bank so we could request the video footage again. The woman we spoke to, who had worked with me on this issue before, said she was aware of the case and that because it had been so long, I would have to bring the police report I filed ( which I was not able to file, see above ) and a subpoena in order to see the evidence they used. She claimed they had tried to contact me about the video footage several times this summer but I never responded ; however, I had no letters from them, and without fluent English, I would not have been able to understand a voicemail to call back. 

Now I am looking at getting a lawyer to help because I don't want this problem to continue to happen in my community. This bank needs to take responsibility for not properly checking the ID of the person who accessed my account, and I want them to return the money that was taken."

Debt collection,"On XX/XX/XXXX I returned a vehicle to Toyota XXXX XXXX dealership after 3 months of not being able to afford the monthly payment of $ XXXX. I was not provided any type of documentation when I returned the vehicle in XXXX. Two months after the incident, XX/XX/XXXX, the Toyota credit is claiming they sent a statement with some due fees I owed from the returned vehicle. Which, I never received a notice in the mail in XXXX. After I began investigating this matter, I found out about it when i was denied a mortgage application, i called Toyota and they provided me with a copy of that statement that was sent out in XX/XX/XXXX. My account was sent to collections in XX/XX/XXXX, but I was never provided with a statement explaining the charges and my rights to dispute this account. I have never heard of this account from Toyota since XXXX, they do have all my contact information since i currently own a vehicle from the same dealership. I contacted a legal adviser and they explained my rights and they suggested me to start a dispute with the Bureaus and also to dispute the account with Toyota itself due to fail to comply with the law, which states I should of been notified as a consumer when they notified all bureaus about a collection and damaged my credit."

Debt collection,"On or around XX/XX/2018, my mother received a phone call asking for me and telling her I need to call them because there is a warrant for my arrest. Later that day, my Father who lives in a completely different state called and said he received a similar call stating if he did not give them my contact information, he would be sued along with me. I finally decided to give them a call because I do not get into trouble criminally so I was intrigued. When I called, I was immediately threatened with a lawsuit if I did not pay the amount owed on years old debt. I clarified with them that this was a debt situation and not a criminal suit and they said yes. I asked them why they were contacting my family in regards to a debt as if I am facing jail time. They continued to ask about my financial situation. I informed them that I had been unemployed for over a year and am now XXXX  and on XXXX XXXX and did not currently have an income. The representative then stated well if you can't pay all of it we will push your lawsuit through. I explained to them that there is no possible way for me to pay them in the condition I am in now but since I am now aware of the situation, I will rectify as soon as I am able to work again. I also asked them not to contact the number I called them from because it was a family members phone I was borrowing or my parents. They assured me that they would not call that number but, this morning ( XX/XX/2018 ) that family member received a call in regards to my "" case '' and got scared. Once I spoke with them they again told me to contact their "" legal locating office '' or they will come to my last known address/work. At this point I am feeling harassed and backed into a corner on a situation I can not amend right now."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I disputed the account in XXXX and XXXX to the Credit Bureau and to the 2nd collection agency that purchased the account. To this date XXXX XXXX has never provided a signed original contract validating the Debt. Last year in XXXX the account was removed from my credit report and placed back on in XX/XX/XXXX. The company keeps claiming they validated the account but as the consumer requesting a copy of the original contract with my original signature which I am entitled, XXXX XXXX continues to ignore my request for this document. 

Recently I just requested information from the listed original creditor which is listed as XXXX XXXX, they provided a letter stating the original delinquency date was XX/XX/XXXX the date of the first missed payment which is about 7yrs ago, also I was provided a copy of a letter from the original 3rd party collections agency which is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX so even if this debt were to be validated with an original contract with my original signature this should be off or coming off of my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",It was 2013 when I required the service from XXXX. I had two phones and from the conversation with the customer service representative I was lead to believe that my service would be under data management meaning if the data get low it automatically stops until the renewal of data and for some odd reason the bill was very excessive amount and they dropped the ball and wanted me to pay for the mistake. Even though there was inconvenience on there end tried to charge me a {$300.00} cancellation fee. I am all around flabbergasted and would like to have this resolved and remove from credit because it's hindering my progress.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XXXX of XXXX my home in XXXX XXXX, Florida was damaged by Hurricane Irma and declared a FEMA disaster area. After over 1 year of recovery and {$160000.00} I think my house is repaired. FEMA did not offer any assistance as I had insurance and they referred me to the SBA which was quite helpful. Albeit a 3rd TD on my house at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX. 

XXXX, my loan servicer, offered me a forbearance period pursuant to FNMA guidelines as being in a FEMA declared disaster area from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I was granted a forbearance period for monthly payments until XX/XX/XXXX. 

After XX/XX/XXXX they want a lump sum payment of {$40000.00}. Not what they told me. 

It cost over {$160000.00} to repair my house. 

XXXX managed my repair escrow account during the process. 

They granted me and told me that at the end of the forbearance period my loan would be modified to include the foregone payments and it would be added to the principal balance and modified. 

They have now offered a loan mod. on a 20 year amortization increasing my monthly payment by {$2000.00}. That hurts. They offered counseling. Serious? 

They did not tell me the truth! When I call them they claim the call will be recorded. I have asked for the recorded audio records to prove what I was told. 

They told me the forbearance would not effect my credit. 

My FICO score has dropped from XXXX to XXXX and they report me as 180+ days delinquent. Not what I signed up for! I could not get a car loan with that FICO. 

XXXX XXXX  has reduced my credit limit on my unsecured credit line from {$13000.00} to $ {$3000.00} as they ran my credit and they were not impressed. 

XXXX is not being fair. They respond but not satisfactory. 

All my bills are paid on time. You have my permission to run my credit report. 

This is not RIGHT! 

My credit to me is very important. I complied with everything they told me. 

This is not right! 

Not sure how or if I need to upload the supporting documentation. The last conversation I had with "" XXXX '' at XXXX he told me I was delinquent 180+ days and it could not be changed. How can I be delinquent in forbearance? "" XXXX '' said they can't fix my FICO. XXXX! 

I made payments at the end of forbearance in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 

I want them to fix my credit report!!! 

I have done all I was told I needed to do. This is not fair. I did not make the Hurricane and complied with all I was told I needed to do to repair my house. What's the point of FEMA, SBA, and FNMA? It's not RIGHT! 

I want my FICO back to XXXX all I have all the back up documentation. XXXX has my correspondents also. Where do I go from here?"

I was told by a male employee the reaffirmation was left sitting on someone's desk for 2 weeks, he would take of it and everything would be fine. I have tried both in XXXX of XXXX and again now XXXX to get them to fix this problem. Then and now Wells Fargo is telling me it was sent to them to late to file with the courts and that they will not report my payments to the credit bureaus. I feel since the correct signed reaffirmation paperwork was submitted to them by at least XX/XX/XXXX and the bankruptcy wasn't discharged until XX/XX/XXXX that Wells Fargo Home Mortgage had plenty of time to file the reaffirmation to the court and therefore should be reporting my credit to the credit bureaus retroactively for XX/XX/XXXX payment to present which have all been on time or within the banks 10 day grace period since I may pay from my bank on the due date and Wells Fargo may not post it for 2 to 3 days. Each time we have contacted them regarding this issue, they say they are investigating the problem and come back after at least a month and say it's my problem, no one told me it was on someone's desk for 2 weeks, no such phone call took place and they will not report my payments to the credit bureaus. I hope you can help me with this disgraceful way they are doing business."

Credit reporting,"I applied for a job and was offered a position. Subsequent to that a credit report was requested. There were XXXX items that were reported incorrectly. As a result of the incorrect items an adverse action was taken against me ie rescinding a job offer. These XXXX items as reported were. 1. a bill of {$260.00} reported by XXXX for an account listed in XX/XX/XXXXand held for two months. I returned the items apparently comcast lost them or incorrectly listed the items as not returned. 
2. XXXX. I have had an account with XXXX for about 20 years. This past year I did not work for six months consequently XXXX disconnected my service for two months service. I have tried to talk to XXXX XXXX without success. Once I work I will be able to pay them back but given the availability of streaming and low cost alternatives maybe not but I should not have a job offer rescinded. 
3. Villages of XXXX XXXX, XXXX Oregon. I went to XXXX to work for two months. I took over a sublet. I was required to pay first and last months when I moved in. I stayed for two months, I gave notice a month in advance. I paid for three months and stayed for two. It has been impossible to resolve this without hiring an lawyer in XXXX Oregon which is across the country from where I live. 
4. IRS. Like XXXX other people I was impacted by the XXXX. I listed the foreclosure judgement on my house as a loss. The IRS did not like that. They imposed a lien on my house. To have it removed I need to hire a lawyer who the IRS will talk to. They will not talk to me. I should not lose a job over this. Furthermore a lot of my effort in the past 5 years has been to keep my house. 
5. Because of the above, i bought a car with a ridiculous interest rate. I was out of work for several months. XXXX XXXX did crazy reporting. It has been impossible to talk to anyone at XXXX XXXX. 
Debtors prison has been done away with. I have had a long slow climb out of debt. To have a job rescinded because of previous debt is ridiculous and beyond the scope or abilities of an Human Resources manager. I agree to have a background check but to use the results of a background as grounds to rescind a job offer is nuts. Credit reporting is mainly a tool wielded by bullies used to justify higher interest rates, and in this case lose a job. Telling the IRS in XX/XX/XXXX that I had been out of work for 18 months was useless, as their prime focus is to pick on people who ca n't fight back. Its what they do. The have a lien on my house. I ca n't sell it without paying off the IRS. Mine is a story of what can happen when XXXX hits the fan but I should not have a job offer rescinded because of previous debt. This is most unfair."

Credit card or prepaid card,"Both of my credit card accounts with Chase Card Services were recently closed. I was told that one of the cards was closed for delinquent status and the other one was closed at management 's discretion. Here are my reasons for not being able to stay on top of the credit card payments in a timely fashion... 

I ) ACCOUNT # ENDING IN XXXX a ) Account # ending in XXXX had some significant fraudulent charges and I was waiting for the credits to come through, II ) BOTH CREDIT CARD ACCOUNT NUMBERS ENDING IN XXXX and XXXX - a ) my oldest daughter had a nervous breakdown and I had to take care of her over the last 5 - 6 months. I have attached a copy of the durable power of attorney which authorizes me to act on my daughter 's behalf and hospital reports. 
b ) In addition to this, I have my own business and I been in an ongoing battle XXXX XXXX over the XX/XX/XXXX account fraud and the investigation is still going on. The fraud ( purposely set up in the wrong account ) has devastated my life and my business. I have attached of the complaints I filed with the CFPB on XXXX XXXX. 

Chase Card Services did not want to hear any of the family/personal issues I have dealt with over the last 5-6 months ; this issue actually dates back to XX/XX/XXXX when she had her first nervous breakdown and I have been working with my daughter ever since. 

Chase Card Services was very rude and insensitive especially telling me that they can close my accounts for any reason and/or at anytime. My problem with this is first they did not know all of the facts and second, they may have closed the account for the wrong reason. They told me that the system/computers makes the decision and there is nothing they can do and then I asked to speak to a human, a supervisor, who could make a decision after hearing all of the facts ; the supervisor gets on the phone and basically says the same crap about the system and management is free to do whatever they want with the account and the decision is final. I also offered to make a payment if they reopened at least one of the accounts and they refused. 

These were life-changing events and I was not able to handle these issues while helping my daughter. I have a business and at least one credit card."

Mortgage,"Carrington Mortgage began servicing my mortgage recently, with the first payment being due to them in XX/XX/2019. Firstly, I believe that the payment options Carrington provides to consumers are unacceptable and are being offered with mal-intent. The previous mortgage servicing companies I have dealt with, of which there have been many, were able to offer reasonable, accurate, and no fee payment options that any American consumer would expect to encounter when conducting this type of routine business. It is simply unacceptable to demand a fee to make a simple electronic payment. 

Secondly, I have made payment to Carrington on XX/XX/2019 through my credit union 's bill pay feature. Carrington received my payment, but did not apply the excess payment to my principal balance. Instead, Carrington has applied the excess payment as future regular monthly payments - this is a blatant attempt to collect more interest and is completely at odds with consumer interests. I called to correct the issue, and was told it would be corrected. However, it has not yet been reflected in the records. In addition to this, I was told that if I continue to make my payments in one of the very few fee-free payment options they provide I would have to call in and correct this exact issue every month. Needless to say, that is completely unacceptable. The only other fee-free option provided to me without the hassle of calling in every month does not allow me to make additional principal payments in excess of $ XXXX/month. I am currently attempting to make additional principal payments that exceed this artificial cap put in place by Carrington. I feel that I am being unduly burdened in order to make a simple mortgage payment. I have only encountered this situation with Carrington and no other banks or mortgage servicing companies. Please correct this issue, whereby I can make my mortgage payment with additional principal without unfair burden."
Student loan,"I have two student loans that continue to show up through Navient.

Mortgage,"I applied for a mortgage loan refinance with Quicken Loans. I was preliminarily approved, received a rate lock and paid a {$500.00} fee for the appraisal, based upon Quicken Loans saying that the appraisal fee had to be paid to confirm the rate lock. A day later, feeling like I was pressured unnecessarily to pay the {$500.00} appraisal fee, I applied to another lender who provided a preliminary approval at a significantly lower rate and closing costs. I contacted Quicken Loans and requested to withdraw my application with them and for a refund of the appraisal fee, which was never performed.

Since then I have not received a confirmation from Quicken Loans that my loan application with them has been withdrawn and they have not refunded the {$500.00} appraisal fee I paid even though the appraisal was neither scheduled or performed.

I received a better deal from another mortgage lender but Quicken Loans is not cooperating in my request to withdraw my loan application and to refund the fee I paid for a service that was not performed."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Experian has not blocked the fraudulent accounts that are listed on my Experian Credit File, All they could tell me when I called to have these items blocked that were opened due to Identity theft was that, the creditor has provided "" sufficient '' Evidence that these are my accounts. Yet that isn't possible, because for one the XXXX Account shows 2 payments in the amount of {$0.00} then it shows 2 deliquencies One in XX/XX/XXXX and one in XX/XX/XXXX, Which doesn't make sense because wheres 's all the other dates? We are here in XX/XX/XXXX.  Experian skipped all those months, and yet also this account was opened at a fraudulent address that EXPERIAN Fraud Department verified that they blocked in XX/XX/XXXX. Yet they have listed both a XXXX card account which again is on my FTC Identity Theft Affidavit which has been sent to the police, and a XXXX Account. You have to be a member of the military of have family in the military to join XXXX which I do not have either, nor have I ever been associated with the military.

The documentation for these accounts were sent to fraudulent addresses both account applications were fraudulent and Experian does not have any sufficient evidence besides an invalid license that the company is trying to provide them that doesn't actually match my license. These are fraudulent accounts and per law 603 ( B ) I have not materially misrepresented anything."
Debt collection,"the date they have as the opening date of the account is wrong, they indicated that i had the debt in XX/XX/2014 which was wrong, it was way before that and they refused to send the copies of the documents i signed"
Debt collection,"I was illegally balance billed by an XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX for an emergency XXXX  XXXX XXXX done in the emergency room at XXXX XXXX Hospital on XX/XX/XXXX. He was paid by my HMO but balance billed me for more . California 's Knox Keene act prohibits this and sets settling it between the doctor and HMO insurer. I sent a letter to the doctors billing department quoting the California law and its subsequent California Supreme Court ruling in support of it. 

I received a phone call from IQMS ( iQualified management services in Colorado ) on XX/XX/XXXX advising that it had been turned over to them collections. I advised the individual I spoke with that this was an illegal billing. She hung up and sent me a collection demand. I sent a detailed letter to them on XX/XX/XXXX describing the situation and the relevant law, and told them to cease and desist all communications with me. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from IQMS with a bunch of gobbledegoop billing stuff irrelevant to my dispute, violating the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) since I had asked them to desist in calling, letter writing or any other contact. Included was a copy of my XX/XX/XXXX letter stating a cease and desist. 

The Knox Keene act specifically states that ER doctors must accept the HMO patient and if they dispute it, its between the provider and insurer and NOT the patient. 

Some of the goop I got back from IQMS claims that this is a "" coinsurance amount ''. I had already exceeded my out of pocket maximum with my insurer prior to XXXX XXXX bill to me, so there can be no "" co-insurance '' charged to me directly. 

I also had two contacts with XXXX XXXX, both of which told me it was not legal for them to make this collection and XXXX XXXX sent the doctor a letter advising him of such, which he ignored. 

If you XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX you will see nothing but one star reviews regarding incorrect billing and practices."
Checking or savings account,"I opened the account based on a promotion : Qualifications to receive {$400.00} Welcome Bonus - within 150 days of account opening, receive a cumulative monthly total of {$3000.00} or more in qualifying direct deposits to the checking account opened for this bonus offer for three consecutive months. 

I travel abroad and upon calling Wells Fargo, they would not allow me access to reissue direct deposit after my depositor stated they had to have a letter directly from them. 

So the deposits were unable to be set up until beginning of XXXX. But this was after calling Wells Fargo, and them repeatedly denying my inquiries. Also, blocks on accessing their website from outside the U.S. presumably. I explained to the agent that my promotion required my direct deposits but he said that I needed to come into a bank branch which is physically impossible. 

Still, I deposited values, equaling over {$29000.00} during the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, which meets the requirements for deposits within 150 days over 3 consecutive months. The bank representative XXXX XXXX in customer care at first told me that they were not made within first 3 months ( not as promotion period stated ). When I corrected her that I had until XX/XX/XXXX to be within 150 days, she stated that {$3000.00} was not made in XXXX, but the promotion states cumulative monthly total, and she refused to honor it. 

To beware : 1- Wells Fargo prevented me from setting up direct deposit through their "" safety measures '' while I was out of the country, disallowing me from quickly satisfying terms. 
2- Wells Fargo read an absolute ( or partial ) sum of one month to say I did not qualify, instead of the cumulative sum that they placed in their offer.

Since I stopped making my payments because they went from around {$360.00} to {$900.00} they have been callin gme non stop- suddenly I am also getting random calls from weird telemarketers. I noticed a correlation to an increase in calls form Navient when ever I answer one of these telemarketer calls right after, like immediately after. Its like Navient knows I answered so they will call. I have asked some of the telemarketers flat out if they are associated with Navient and they stall and say they have never heard of that company- American- english speaking costumer service reps! This morning I got a call from a FL ( where I reside ) - Navient has been calling from PA and suddenly I answered a telemarketer call last night from a FL # and now Navient is calling with a FL area code. I asked the Navient rep if he was in FL- he stated he was not- I asked him if Navient is now spoofing # 's and he said Navient has offices ' all over the world- I asked if they had an office in FL- he said he did not know. 

Aside from this I have communicated to Navient numerous times that I can not afford my monthly payment. They will then send me letters in the email saying they understand and I should call in so they can help me. I call in and they are no help- they do not lower my monthly payment. I provide my income and expenses and nothing! They do not take into consideration that I am also paying on my fed loans- havent had a raise in 3 years and made less $ this year. I shared all this with the agent who began to ask me about my career decisions- why havent I looked for a better job ( I have ), why havent I taken on another job- I would need 3 more to pay them the money they want- because I made mistakes when I was young and come from an XXXX mother that did not know any better. The agent explained even though I was on a low payment plan before it must keep increasing because the goal of the lower payment plans is to work you up to your full high payment- whihc I just canno do. They {$360.00} I was paying monthly was basically money thrown away - has not made a dent with my interest rates. I told them I can not pay what I do not have- they keep repeating they are helping me by giving me a low payment- and I keep telling them its not a lower payment if I can not afford it and it is an increase from the originally lowered payment I was alreay struggling to make. Everytime I get off the phone with them I am in tears. What did I go to college for? They harrass me day in and day out!"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I purchased a year long membership with XXXXXXXX XXXX using a CapitalOne GMCard on XX/XX/2016. At the time, I authorized a one time payment to pay for this membership in full. A contract was drawn up that showed I paid in full for that year. Two years later, I went back into the gym, and was told I could pay month to month. I gave them a different GMCard to pay for the first month. I never signed any paperwork. I was specifically not under any contract or obligation to them. I realized later that they had stored my credit card info and were charging me automatically on the new card despite my not having authorized it. When I finally had the chance, I called them and told them to stop charging my card. They demanded that I come down in person and fill out a request to cancel membership. I had just given birth at the time, and could not physically go to the gym. Furthermore, I had not authorized this charge, nor was I under contract. A contract signed three years ago and paid in full does not become binding again because I set foot at that gym again two years later. I called CapitalOne to dispute the  charges. XXXX responded to the with the contract from XX/XX/2016. On the contract, it clearly states paid in full. Furthermore, it has a different credit card number, which was the one I authorized them to use for the one time annual fee. This was not the one with the disputed charges. CapitalOne kept demanding paperwork from me that I did not have. I can not prove that I didnt have a contract ; I can not provide documentation that doesnt exist. I called CapitalOne and, at the request of their rep, wrote and submitted a letter explaining why I couldnt produce the paperwork they requested. A week later CapitalOne sent me a letter saying that my dispute was denied because the 14 day period in which I had to produce the paperwork had passed."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have made past requests to bring clarity and validation on 9 creditor disputes that I believe was related to identity theft. I have since then XX/XX/XXXX submitted a police report about my identity theft, dating back to XX/XX/XXXX of an incident of my identity theft, which brought every account into scrutiny as to whether the entire account was invalid by being created with using my personal information or portions of the account 's balance being a cause of identity theft with unwarranted charges to the account. 

Since then XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX, have addressed some of the issues with some these disputed creditors according results like CFPB report # XXXX, which suggests that identity theft was possibly at work behind those accounts that were deleted as result. 

Yet I am still getting targeted and bullied by creditors and collection agencies that have not been able to produce an original wet signature from my own hand to validate these accounts ( this would be my right and protection according to Federal Law, section 609 ). 
I have reason to believe that because there is no valid response since XX/XX/XXXX these accounts I am disputing may also have some involvement of identity theft as well. 

Can you cause them to stop with their bullying since they have failed to comply with my request of validation of these accounts? The issue is still unaddressed concerning this and it has been since XXXX XXXX XXXX that there has been no wet signature of my writing to validate the source of these documents. According to our federal governing laws of section 609, I ask that you verify that these accounts have already been deleted from my XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX Credit Report.. 
Accounts that have not been properly addressed are : Original creditor : XXXX XXXX. with account number : XXXX Current creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX : XXXX Original creditor : XXXX XXXX XXXX with account number : XXXX MCM account Number : XXXX Current Owner : Midland Funding LLC If  any of these are reported on XXXX, XXXX, and/or XXXX  can you please verify them with a matching original wet signature by my own hand ( this request is backed by Federal Law, of Section 609 )? And since it has been since XX/XX/XXXX, with already no matching wet signature by my own hand, can you according to Federal Law, section 609 have these creditors deleted from all three of these credit bureaus and have Midland Funding LLC, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. to desist from their bullying efforts according to Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
Even If any of these are not reported or are reported on the these three Bureaus, can you have them stop with the bullying and forward this complaint to the Attorney General of the United States Government according to my rights stipulated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA )."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Approximately XX/XX/2018 I noticed my fico score dropped around 50 points out of no where. This was apparently due to a serious delinquency according to my fico score. I retrieved all 3 credit reports from the credit bureaus and there were no issues regarding a delinquent account. I called XXXX and apparently one of my student loans from navient hadnt reported in a while so I filed a dispute and that was eventually resolved. Being that is was a year ago I dont recall the outcome specifically but I believe they began reporting again. Now, a year later, my fico score is still low due to a delinquent account. I still do not show any delinquent accounts. I called the loan company ( Navient ) who assured me all my payments were on time or there was one late payment when navient took over XXXX and I sent a check to XXXX instead of navient but navient assured me about 2 days ago that wasnt reported. Additionally if it was reported its ridiculous because they changed companies and where my check has to go wasnt where my auto payments sent it. Again there are no delinquent accounts or missed payments on any of my credit reports. XXXX has basically said I have to call the loan company navient and navient has said I have to call XXXX to resolve this issue. I am looking to get a mortgage in the near future and my fico score is being affected by a phantomlate payment."

Mortgage,"Quicken loans VA XXXX. 
This company has a XXXX deposit ( unlike any of the other 1000 's  of mortgage companies. The policy in itself is not inline with VA standards. VA streamlines or for the veteran NOT for some huge company to save money. I made the stupid deposit with this company on end of business Friday XX/XX/XXXX. I emailed to have my loan application withdrawn and deposit refunded on Monday XX/XX/XXXX ( less than one business day ). I told them in the email I would pay the XXXX for their credit check ( no one else charges this either ) but that there was no way an appraisal was done in less than a business day. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX Quicken sent me a notification that the appraisal was done. I sent them another email with my previous email asking for it to be withdrawn. They just keep going and attempting to charge me. I filed a dispute with my credit card company which is a XXXX and I highly doubt they will let this kind of behavior go through. However, the VA and CFPD have some level of obligation to ensure these sort of practices are not being used on Veterans ( normal people too ). I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX veteran, attempting to use a benefit while this company reaps massive amounts off of veterans. This kind of behavior should be nipped, they have plenty of complain ts regarding this same behavior. Why is the VA still certifying them to do business with us?"
Credit card or prepaid card,"I set up a new payment account to pay my Banana Republic Visa bill through Synchrony's website.  I had the wrong account number so the payment was returned. I was notified of the returned payment by Synchrony but NEVER notified that more than one returned payment would result in my account closure and loss of points earned. I revised the payment account number but this was also returned. I contacted my credit union and was informed I have a limit of 6 transactions per month from the account, which I was unaware of. This is why they refused the electronic payment. I then logged in to the Synchrony website to revise the payment method, and saw it said ""this account has been closed."" I then received an email from XXXX XXXX asking if I closed this account. I NEVER got notice OR warning from Synchrony Banana Republic Visa that a second returned payment would result in immediate closure of my account and loss of points. I called Synchrony and was told, sorry it's a term (hidden someone in the fine print of course) yes two returned payment your account is closed automatically with no opportunity to reinstate it.  Please note, my account was in good standing and my minimum balance was paid so the two returned payments are the sole reason my account was closed."
Vehicle loan or lease,"In connection with Ally Financial : this company has been horrible to work with.

Credit card or prepaid card,"I went to pay off the total balance due on my credit card at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX branch of Citizens Bank on XX/XX/2018. I told the teller that I was there to pay off the balance on my credit card. I gave the teller {$180.00} first, which was supposed to be put towards the balance of my credit card. The remaining balance on my credit card was to be paid by my fiance through a second transaction. We asked the teller if it were easier if he were to pay the remainder from his debit card or with cash. He was alreading taking money out of the atm, and she said it would be easy to pay in cash. He paid the rest of the balance, which was the remainder ( {$160.00} ). We left that day under the impression that the card was paid off completely. 

A week and a half later I went to the bank to pay off the next round of charges which were equal to {$170.00}. The teller on that day told me that I owed over {$400.00}, and I said that couldn't be right, so she told me to call the number on the back of my credit card. I made no payments that day, because I wanted to resolve any misappropriated funds. When I called the customer service credit division, they told me to have a copy of any receipts I had from that day faxed to accounting. I went to the branch to do this, and the fax was not working that day. It was at this time we noticed that the money was deposited into a wrong account, not put towards the credit card as the teller was instructed to do. We could not find a transaction receipt for the other funds that were given to the teller to pay off the rest of the credit card. I called Customer Service of the Credit Division again that night, and was told to call them from the bank branch to help resolve the issue. 

A couple days later I went in to speak with someone about resolving the issue. It was the same teller that made the mistakes on the XX/XX/XXXX. Innitially she set up an appointment for the following XX/XX/XXXX. She cancelled that appointment and told us that a Chairman of the Board would call us because she didn't feel comfortable resolving the issue. I instead payed the {$170.00} towards the CC so that any remaining funds were those that I believed I payed off via the bank when I gave them cash to put towards the balance and also associated late fees because those payments were misappropriated. I always keep up with my payments, and if there are issues I do my best to resolve them in a timely manner. 

That week, XXXX, a chairman of the board called. She talked in circles about information I would need to provide to them. She told me to fax what receipts I had to her. She told me many times she could not reference transactions without a receipt. I wanted to at least sent her what I had, which was a copy of the receipt for {$180.00} I got for money given to the teller ... .money that was supposed to go towards paying off my CC balance, but instead was accidently deposited by the teller into someone else 's account ( I did not authorize a deposit of {$180.00}, it was supposed to be a payment towards my CC balance ). We could not locate the other transaction, and though someone from Customer Service in the Credit Division told me that the bank should be able to locate it through the records from the day, XXXX seemed unable and unwilling to help without that specific transaction information. I told her I would fax the information I had over and she assured me 3 times that she would call me the following Wednesday to touch base no matter what. 

I faxed the receipt on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX tried calling on XX/XX/XXXX but I was unavailable. I waited for her call on XX/XX/XXXX and did not receive one. I even called her office around XXXX to try to reach her, but got her answering machine. I also called XX/XX/XXXX and got no response, no call back. I then called XX/XX/XXXX and left a message again. I reached out to the Customer Service line once more and XXXX assured me he would let XXXX know I was trying to reach her. 

XXXX finally called back later on XX/XX/XXXX. I was so frustrated by this point, having poured many hours into resolving this issue. XXXX told me that the receipt that I sent was a deposit into someone else 's account and that she would need proof I was making a payment towards my credit card. Well, if the teller hadn't made a mistake then I would have the proper information, but this is one of the reasons I was calling. The money wasn't put towards the credit card, as I instructed the teller to do. I was so frustrated at this point and heated, I resolved to reach out to consumer finance to file a complaint. I should not have so much trouble trying to resolve this. 

Whether this was a mistake or intentional misappropriation of funds by the teller, the bank has done little to help me actually resolve this issue. The bank doesn't even seem to care that the teller made mistakes, telling me they can't do anything to help me. That is why I am reaching out to the CFPD. 

I hope that the CFPD can assist me in resolving this issue. I have had good standing with the bank so far and I do not wish this to negatively affect my credit."

Mortgage,"This compliant relates to Chase not making payment on time for escrow funds. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed 2 supplemental tax bills to Chase Mortgage on my newly built home and mortgage. Chase purchased my mortgage from another lender shortly after settlement. This is my first experience with Chase. 

Earlier I received a partial refund of my Escrow account ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) from Chase, presumably a result of settlement dollars being fully processed after settlement and closing. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase to inquire why the tax bills had not paid on time. I was informed that the taxes are still being processed. I was also informed that they have a 7 day processing policy for these requests, but a ticket was only opened on XX/XX/XXXX, 22 days after I faxed in the tax bills. As of XX/XX/XXXX, the bills have not been paid and I have now received a delinquency notice from the taxing authority. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was also told by a Chase service agent that the payments for the Taxes are still 'in process '. I asked to file a complaint and was transferred to a supervisor to do so. I was asked by the customer service agent and the supervisor if I cashed the XXXX escrow refund check to which I answered yes. I asked if I shouldn't have cashed the refund check in XX/XX/XXXX, and the supervisor replied that yes I should have cashed it. I am aware that the new tax bills would represent a future shortage during the next escrow analysis. 

My complaint is simply that Chase is not processing escrow payments on a timely basis and I now have to pay penalties from the local taxing authorities. As a new Chase customer, I did everything I was supposed to do and was only provided excuses from Chase, saying that they only received my request on XX/XX/XXXX, when in fact, I have proof ( fax confirmation ) that Chase actually received it on XX/XX/XXXX. 

The Chase supervisor agreed to escalate and monitor payment, and call me back when paid. 

Someone should be regulating Chase 's Escrow department for timeliness of receipt and payment of customer escrow requests."

Now finally this collection agency Contract Callers, INC have finally sent a copy of a bill that they say is a validation that I own and owe this debt yet the information they sent does not have my name, it has no information as to my DOB, Social Security number, etc. with what was sent this is not a validation of the debt that they claim that I owe to them. Like before I am requesting that this debt be DELETED from all three of my credit reports and not be allowed to be placed back on my reports due to the fact that not once but twice now the original creditor XXXX has not been able to provide adequate validation to prove that this account is mine yet they constantly keep reselling this debt to different collection companies who can not validate the debt yet they are placing it on my credit reports anyway thus ruining my credit as fast as I can try to restore it."

Mortgage,"At the end of XX/XX/2018, NewRez contacted me about my loan application with XXXX XXXX   and offered me to match or make a better offer if I applied with them as they will offer me a portfolio loan meaning NewRez was in need to sell my loan. By midXXXX, I started a new application with NewRez and I received an approval in XXXX. However, NewRez did not fund the transaction explaining by the end of XXXX that the loan could not close because the property was title on a Land Trust even though this was disclosed at front along with the trust documents from the beginning of the loan application. Then, I agreed to remove the property from the land trust as I was assured that this was the only item holding funding after underwriter review. 
Just after the property was removed from the Land Trust I filed a new application with NewRez as it was instructed and a second approval was received on XX/XX/XXXX. However, Im still waiting for closing today and the file still under review. NewRez requested updated documents like title work, updated statements, a letter from one of my lenders, title work, proof of insurance and these documents were provided in a timely manner. Ive been told several times closing is next Friday as everything else has been approved, but the title company confirmed that NewRez has not sent finalized documents to fund the transaction tomorrow XX/XX/XXXX. 
I had spent money and time to fulfil every request, I paid to remove the property out of the trust, I paid for the appraisal and I put a hold to my business, so I do not change my financials or credit history while the file still pending with the underwriters.

Then an hour later someone called from Chase and said they needed one more thing XXXX a signed contractor agreement because they couldn't read the signature ). I instantly uploaded what they asked for. Today, I called them and the first person said they would be paying as they had everything they needed, but we got disconnected when I wanted to ask about timing. I called back, waited on hold, and the new person told me they needed that same document but now with two signatures. 

This same process has happened again and again, where they say money is coming XXXX and it doesn't ) and I call back and they say they need one more thing. On more than one occasion, they haven't accepted a document and I resend the exact same document which then they accept. 

I've asked at least 5 times to talk to a manager or have a supervisor call me, which they always say the manger is too busy or I'll get a call back in 24 hours, but I never get the call. I believe Chase is intentionally holding my money as long as possible and this has nothing to do with the repair process."
Student loan,"It has come to my attention, after receiving a notice of wage garnishment from the U.S. Department of Education, that GC Services has made a significant error while managing my student loan account. Although I completed GC Services loan rehabilitation program in XX/XX/XXXX, the system never sent my account to a non-defaulted servicer. I have the original letter from CG Services dated XX/XX/XXXX confirming completion of the rehabilitation program I enrolled in the month of XX/XX/XXXX. GC Services, in error, returned my account as delinquint to the Department of Education, who in turn submitted the account to collections through XXXX XXXX XXXX. Since receiving the completion letter from GC Services dated XX/XX/XXXX, I have not received any notifications or letters from them regarding my account or its status and assumed they were still taking automatic payment on my loans, which they were not. This error has occurred secondary to prior negligence on GC Services behalf in processing multiple automatic payments incorrectly in XX/XX/XXXX. Automatic payments were set up on the account and began on XX/XX/XXXX in the agreed upon amount of {$56.00} dollars. Per GC Services, a typo was made when they entered my payment into their system, which led to only a {$5.00} payment being drafted from my bank account. I spoke to them multiple times to resolve this issue as soon as I became aware of it. GC Services acknowledged the error on their behalf and assured me it would be remedied and that it would not lengthen the 9 month period that our agreement had stipulated for rehabilitation. I also reported the circumstances and GC Services negligence to the U.S. Department of Education. On XX/XX/XXXX, GC Services sent the U.S. Department of Education an apology that acknowledged an error on their behalf in processing my payments. I spoke to the U.S. Department of Education on XX/XX/XXXX regarding the status of my loans and the negligence of GC Services. They confirmed that although it appeared I had completed the rehabilitation program my account was sent back to them by GC services for delinquency in XX/XX/XXXXin error. I was advised that my only option at this point, as GC Services is no longer the collecting agency, is to request a hearing with the U.S. Department of Education and forward them all of the documentation I have saved from GC Services. While I was unaware that GC Services had falsely reported me as delinquent to the Department of Education, my credit has been impacted negatively and I am accruing delinquent charges and extra interest on my loans. GC Services has claimed that I stopped making payments and did not meet the requirement of 9 on time monthly payments. My payments were AUTOMATIC scheduled payments set up with them in XX/XX/XXXX and GC Services never notified me of stopping our payment agreement or a change in my account status, not even a bill. I have attached my proof if making 11 ON TIME MONTHLY payments, directly deducted from my personal checking account. Per conversations with GC Services representatives and their acknowledgment of their payment processing error on my account, their error would absolutely not affect the timeframe of my rehabilitation. I have also attached the notice they sent following my XX/XX/XXXX monthly payment stating my completion of the rehabilitation program."
Student loan,"I have 5 student loans through XXXX XXXX. My monthly payments just went from {$150.00} a month to {$850.00} a month because they came out of deferment. I am a XXXX and I can not afford to pay {$850.00} a month. I tried to refinance my loans to be income based with several other lenders, but I didn't quality for any of them because my credit score is too low. I then called XXXX XXXX to ask them to put me on income based payments. They said they don't do that because they are private loans, but that they could put me on graduated interest payments for 12 months. That only lowered my monthly payment by {$170.00}. When I asked what other options they had for me, the only thing they offered was to move my payment for this month to the end of my loans, but the interest will still add up. So, basically they're offering me one month to somehow find a way to afford this huge monthly payment. There is no way I can afford that, and if I can't make the payments, my credit score is going to go down, and I am trying to increase my credit score."
Debt collection,"Capital Accounts made no attempt to contact me ( if they dispute this they should provide a Certified Mail Return Receipt ) before beginning to assess fees on and reporting this supposed debt to the credit bureaus resulting in significant damage to my credit score. 

I only learned of their actions against me when I noticed a large drop in my credit score in XX/XX/XXXX. After pulling my credit report to figure out what was going on a supposed debt opened on XX/XX/XXXX and reported in XX/XX/XXXX from Capital Accounts was the culprit. This supposed debt is something from XXXX that I have already paid. 

My first attempt to resolve this with the company was a notice of my disputing the debt sent by certified mail on XX/XX/XXXX. After waiting more than a week from the date my letter was signed for and receiving no response I submitted my first complaint regarding this company 's behavior. This was in regard to the lack of any notification about my right to dispute the debt or any notice that they thought I owed a debt at all. The only proof of the debt the company has offered ( in response to the first CFPB complaint ) is a copy of an old ledger which obviously is not proof of any kind. 

I reached out to the company by email on XX/XX/XXXX asking for a copy of the documentation relating to their claimed attempts to contact me. After their non-proof response to the initial complaint I finally had a time frame to investigate my records for. That is how I managed to locate the letter sent to the original creditor and after further searching the transaction record. Two days later I followed up with a second email asking for a response to the letter sent to the original creditor. I have received no response from the company to either email. 

The only contact I have received from this company, besides the damage to my credit score they have caused, was the ledger they provided to CFPB! This is obviously unprofessional and unacceptable behavior from a company that is causing harm to my financial well being and my health ( due to the added stress of this aggravating existing conditions ).

Attached is 1 ) a copy of a letter to the original creditor sent XX/XX/XXXX regarding prior billing issues and a customer copy of the payment authorization form for the dates in dispute 2 ) the transaction details from the bank for when the payment authorization was processed effective XX/XX/XXXX. 

I am sure that Capital Accounts will try to place the blame on the original creditor but the fact of the matter is that Capital Accounts continued taking these negative actions against my credit score even after being notified the debt was disputed. Simply blaming bad information does not absolve them of their behavior. This company is obviously pursuing this supposed debt in bad faith and is engaged in unacceptable business practices."
Checking or savings account,"I opened a checking account with Citibank , N.A . in XX/XX/2019 through the advertisement to earn XXXX XXXX XXXX AAdvantage miles after fulfilling account-opening activity requirements as a new customer. However, I have not received any AAdvantage miles as of XX/XX/2019, even I fulfilled the activities in early XX/XX/2019. I contacted Citibank 's customer service three times, and each time a representative confirmed that I have fulfilled the activity, recorded my complaint and promised that I will receive the award miles soon, because it's more than the advised 90-day period processing time after I fulfill those requirements. 

The latest case number I was given was : XXXX."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Equifax Free Credit Report Online Response-XXXX  XXXX 18 -  Applied for credit from a company that used Equifax 's score of my credit to determine my credit rating. Since this score is lower that XXXX   and XXXX, I was curious to know why and wanted to exercise my right to receive a free annual copy of each report and its contents. Requested a copy of my annual credit report from all three bureaus. Received copy from XXXX  and XXXX. Equifax will not provide online report and requires you to send in a manual form. However, in addition to the form, they request you input your social security number, a copy of your pay stub, a copy of your W-2 form, drivers license, and current utility bill. All of this information being sent through the mail will put your identity at a huge risk and is unfair to the consumer. They are required to provide the report, but refuse to do it without putting the consumer at more risk of identity fraud. 

This is a breach of the law to provide consumers information. I do not want to risk putting all my personal information in the mail to have it vulnerable to identity theft. Their method of providing a report to you ( through the mail ) and requiring the consumer to put all their personally identifying information ( PII ) in the mail is wrong, is a disservice to the public and a slap in the face to the Federal Law that requires them to provide the annual report. This is a travesty and should be addressed. Thank you for hearing my complaint."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have monitoring services with all three credit bureaus which allow me to unlock and lock my credit report, since I am a continuous victim of identity theft. On XX/XX/XXXX, someone unlocked my credit report without my consent and then called and changed addresses, phone numbers, added accounts, credit cards opened, rented a place with my social security number. When I called to see how my credit report was unlocked when I had locked it back in XXXX, they kept transferring me to one department to another and manager to manager. Nobody could answer my question. I was left having to clean up the mess when I am paying them a monthly fee so that I and I alone can unlock and lock my report. I asked them if there was an additional step I could take so that someone impersonating me could not call and unlock my report and they told me that no"
Vehicle loan or lease,"I received a letter from GM Financial that I would receive a final bill for any excess mileage and wear and tear in approx 45 days after I turned in the vehicle. I turned in the Vehicle on XX/XX/2019. On XX/XX/2019 I received a final bill that was due XX/XX/2019. On the bill it stated excess mileage of XXXX, a disposition fee of {$390.00}, and XXXX in tax. I was not made aware of the disposition fee until I received this bill as it is not stated in an identifiable manner but rather buried within the contract. the dealership that leased the vehicle to me did not disclose this to us at the time of leasing the car and we were shocked to receive this bill 3 months after we turned in the car and for 3 times what we anticipated. Upon calling GM financial the associate I spoke to stated the fee was for auction services, however the dealership bought my car and the car was not sold at auction. The GM associate changed her story and said the fee was a end of lease fee, when I asked why I didn't have to pay this on my previous lease she said that she did not know and would have to pull the contract. I also kept checking the website for my lease to see what my final bill was and it stated paid in full along with my credit report which I pulled in XX/XX/2019 which stated paid in full. when I checked my credit report today it not says I owe money and the account is open again this is inaccurate reporting. I feel this is deceptive practices for leasing a vehicle and this information should be accurate, disclosed correctly to the consumer at the time of the lease and not hidden in the contract and reported accurately to credit bureaus. Not a complete surprise 3 months after you turn in a vehicle. The GM financial associate also stated that I have 30 days to pay before I am reported late."
Credit card or prepaid card,"I called into 53 Bank today to check in as to why I was not having up to date credit reporting on my secured card with them and the representative informed me that they was a fraud alert on my card. I informed the representative that I was still able to use my card with no problem and that I was unaware of a fraud alert. I was transferred to a lady who put me through a huge hassle of finding my credit card because she acted like she had no other way of verifying who I was although the many times I have spoken with this department I did not have to have the card in place to go through the verification. The problem I had was that the lady wanted me to talk about some transactions from XXXX here on XX/XX/XXXX. I was outraged at how I would once again have to go through another bombardment of interrogation especially when I just went through all of this months ago. I asked the lady what department as far as FDIC or CFPB regulated 53 bank credit card and she was unaware so I asked if she could speak with her  supervisor and find out and I don't know if they were incompetent or thought it was a joke but i found it ridiculous that the agent nor the supervisor knew what branch of government regulated them as a financial institution. It seemed very redundant to talk to a fraud department to protect consumers but one that was unaware of what government regulated the same laws they are trying to "" enforce '' or "" regulate."
Mortgage,"On Monday, XX/XX/2019 I received a sales letter from Village Capital and Investment, LLC. The letter was designed to mislead me, a veteran, into accepting an IRRR loan. 

I shared my information with them. I agreed to nothing. I was told I would be contacted the following day. I did a XXXX search and ran across this article. I am contacting to say that this company is still trying to swindle myself and fellow veterans. 

Please put a stop to this company. If I have any other complaints due to them now having my information and using it against my will what can I do in that situation? 

Thank you in advance for promptly answering my question. Have a blessed day!"

The letter included a invitation to contact XXXX XXXX from customer account analyst with any questions at XXXX ext. XXXX. I called the number but the automated answer is that extension can not be reached from this number! 
My complaint is simply that PHH has set up a system with the intent to avoid all direct contact with its customers. On XX/XX/XXXX after approx 30 min of various phone transfers and hold delays I was able to speak with an agent who said would make the necessary reversal of the mis-applied payments, but he could not explain why my payments were repeatedly being paid to principle and not as a regular payment."
"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",On today Monday XX/XX/XXXX I got a voicemail stating that I was denied credit at this company by the name of One Financial! I applied for the loan on Friday of last week and talked to a lady names XXXX that assured me that an approval was in place! I never heard the word Debt ratio until today when I called and she said I didnt make enough money! First of all I bring home more than they say I bring home and provided my check stub with proof! This company have been sending me notices after notices begging me to apply for a loan that I had been preapproved for! I am so disappointed and hurt I will never recommend anyone to apply for this company! The lady XXXX mislead me and Im not gon na stop reporting this company! This company is very misleading people!
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Not enough information to verify debt : In XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of 2019 I requested an investigation be conducted by the credit bureaus of an alleged debt owed by me in the amount of {$730.00}. ( account # XXXX ) A proper investigation according to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) requires PHYSICAL verification of an original signed consumer contract and not an electronic or E-oscar verification under which a lot of investigations are being conducted. This software has limitations when it comes to conducting a proper investigation of records to which I have recieved verified as accurate without recieving the documentation that I have requested which is a violation of federal law."
Debt collection,"1 ) It was to my understanding that my student loan debt had been paid in full when I received a collection notice from Action Financial Services ( hereinafter referred to as AFS ). I dispute the validity of this debt, the proof furnished by AFS does not show the origin or history of said debt, nor were they able to provide any viable itemized ledgers. 
2 ) Somewhere between the dates ofXX/XX/XXXX andXX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXXI received the first debt collection notice from AFS. ( See Exhibit A ) 3 ) On XX/XX/ I called AFC to inquire about said account, and at that time I officially requested proof of validity of the debt. 
4 ) OnXX/XX/XXXX I received documents from AFS ( datedXX/XX/XXXX ) ( See Exhibit B ). These documents acknowledged my request for validation of my obligations. Their letter stated Enclosed is a copy of the document ( s ) that will establish the validity of your debt. Included were 2 documents, the first document was a copy of their payment/financial history section ( See Exhibit C ). This report was irrelevant to me as I am unfamiliar and/or unaware of what the information on this report means. For example, there are codes listed in the transaction type, as there is no key, I am unaware as to what these codes refer to. There is also a column titled Debt Number, again I am unaware of what this information refers to. This document in no way shows how the information provided correlates to the debt AFS is attempting to collect. The second document provided was an unknown 3 page document ( See Exhibit D ). At the top of this document it refers to a Repayment Plan, this document is signed by me and dated XXXX. The information included in Exhibit D is barely legible and it is also incomplete ; there is a page 3, a page 2 and the last page is not numbered. The information provided in Exhibit D is inconclusive of were any debt originated, it also fails to provide any tangible proof of the debt that AFS is attempting to collect from me. 
5 ) OnXX/XX/XXXX I called AFS regarding the documents that were sent to me establishing the validity of my debt. I stated to the representative that what they provided was not sufficient proof of the validity of the debt they are trying to collect. During the course of my call, despite my clear agenda to gather more information, the AFS rep made multiple attempts to get me to set up a payment plan. The rep also told me that since I made prior payments on my student loans, that those actions show that I had and/or am accepting the validity of this debt. I stated that I have never made any payments to AFS therefore I have not and am not accepting the validity of this debt. When I asked for more information regarding the origin of this charge and stated that they hadnt done anything to show me what this debt was for. The rep informed me that the burden of proof is on the consumer, and that if I say that I paid this debt that it is my obligation to provide receipts, documentation etc. I asked the rep How am I to provide proof of payment etc. if I dont know what or where this debt came from? He was not able to provide an answer to that question. 
6 ) I would also like to point out a few key unsettling facts regarding said debt and the fines and fees being charged by AFS. 
a. Per the rep on XX/XX/ I was able to obtain the following breakdown regarding the balance they are attempting to collect on : i. {$19000.00} is being collected for Principle ii. {$20000.00} is being collected for Interest iii. {$7000.00} is being collected for Collection Fees b. Although I have been disputing this debt since the first notice was received, the interest keeps accruing at an alarming rate. I dont know what this rate is because I was never provided with any information from AFS regarding rates, terms, etc. On the date that the first AFS notice was rcvd the total debt was listed at {$46000.00} when I called onXX/XX/XXXX by balance was {$46000.00}. This means that in less than one month, and while I was in the process of disputing said debt, the total owed grew by {$130.00}. 

Your diligent review of this case is much appreciated. Thank you for your assistance."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",After reviewing my credit report I noticed several fraudulent accounts. I've tried to resolve this matter with the credit bureaus several times before but to no avail.
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",XXXX XXXX XXXX continue to report on my XXXX a fraudulent debt from XXXX on my credit report. Im in a dispute with XXXX over a fraudulent balance left in my name over an unauthorized device ordered placed without my permission or knowledge. The police reports validate my information and use of my name was stolen to obtain credit and other unauthorized devices. Additionally a debt collector called ERC contacted me yesterday stating XXXX has now sent them the debt to pursue which I have requested for them to open a fraud investigation back with XXXX on this matter. XXXX XXXX has no legal authorization to continue to pursue or report this debt to XXXX   which is a major violation under the FCRA and FDCPA.
Mortgage,"My complaint is about Wells Fargo Bank ( WFB ). I am the sole heir of my father 's home. My attorney already transferred the deed into my name, per the terms of the trust. WF has received this information and has confirmed that they have it. I have been trying to get WFB to put my name on the mortgage and remove my mom and dad, since they are both deceased. I spoke to XXXX at WFB today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and they refuse to do so and indicate that I must meet their assumption or refinance qualifications. I have been paying this mortgage for the past eight months and my understanding is that I do not need to "" qualify '' if I am the child of the deceased and will be living in the home. I mentioned the law does not require an Ability to Pay provision in this case. WFB said that it used to be that way, but that Dodd Frank of 2010 changed and I would have to qualify as if taking on a new mortgage or refinance. I found 12 CRF Part 1026 RIN 3170-ZA00 dated XX/XX/XXXX that addresses this issue in detail. I found another article that confirms this as well. Both are attached. As far as I can tell, WFB staff are incorrect. I feel that they are deliberately violating the rules to try and get me into a new loan, complete with a bunch of new fees. This is after months of run around from them.The only reason I would take on the existing WFB mortgage is for ease and to not have a hard pull on my credit report. I would have no problem qualifying for a mortgage or refinance on my own, but I would seek much better terms than this bank offers. If WFB refuses to work with me, I will simply take my business elsewhere and get a new mortgage. However, what about all of the people who may not have this option? It isn't right that they are not afforded their options because WFB doesn't understand the rules."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","In XX/XX/XXXX I began my undergraduate studies with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA and completed this program in XX/XX/XXXX.

During this time frame I used part of my XX/XX/XXXX  for these programs along with student loans. I had a series of health issues that were not resolved while on active duty that were later compounded that required me to request a deferment/forbearance of my student loans due to my inability to work. Some were granted to my knowledge whereas others were not, which I continued to resolve. Upon careful review and further evaluation by the VA my XXXX rating was increased to 100 %, which qualified me for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) program for my student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX DOE   directed XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX to suspend collection activities on my student loans until they could determine my eligibility for discharge. Effective XX/XX/XXXX, the DOE had approved my discharge of the federal student loans on the basis of my XXXX XXXX XXXX   XXXX.

In addition to these issues several of these same accounts have exceed their legal reporting periods of seven years, with multiple that are over 10 years. In previous communications via letter I was told that such reports could not be removed due to regulations promulgated by the DOE and the FCRA.

Consumer Loan,"Back in the late XXXX my daughter and myself, agreed to help her then boyfriend out in need of a vehicle so I co-signed a loan for a motorcycle. Her then boyfriend at the time which we did not know of had a criminal record for larceny, stealing, scamming, etc. He was formally charged and taken to court by us and others he had scammed. Regardless I was left with the loan. Originally the loan was through XXXX XXXX Bank. That bank is no longer around and my loan was fully paid, however at the time of my loan being finished, they also had been bought out and no paperwork was ever given to me. Also, please keep in mind records are not kept they way they are today electronically. XXXX XXXX Bank is now defunct and several times changed name, etc. My complaint is with Assest Recovery Services, based out of Illinois, with a XXXX XXXX XXXX This is some fly by night company who purchase lists, bad dept loans, list of names etc, defunct loans for pennies on the dollar and use strong arm tactics to scare people into to thinking they owe money when they do not!

After signing the initial paper work that was all done electronically, I get a phone call from XXXX XXXX who ask me for a payment of {$390.00} in order to continue the process. I question why he was asking for money when I was not supposed to be imposed any fees. He stated it was not a fee just a something they do at this point in the process and that it would be returned to me in the form of a check. He assured me that this money was not a fee and would be refunded. Reluctantly I continued to ask him to explain and he repeated that this was not a fee and refundable and that they do this all the time. So I paid the ( no fee ) and thought about it for a couple of days and just did not feel they were being honest and I could not find mention of this fee in any of the paper work I had signed and as well why did he ask for the money over the phone when everything else had been handled electronically. I sent them an e-mail asking that the process be ended and to refund my money. A week later XXXX XXXX called and said that they would not refund my money for it was only refunded only at closing. Therefore I appeal to the CFPB for assistance in what I feel is fraud."

Suntrust never called me to verify these {$5300.00} charges but they said that they did. They NEVER called me. They let a company take {$10000.00} out in 2 payments almost 2 years apart from each other.

I asked Suntrust to do a XXXX way call but they will not. Plus the merchant will not ever email me, call me or text me. Suntrust needs to return my funds. When I call Suntrust their team was extremely rude to me. XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX were all completely rude and blamed me and refused to help. XXXX made threats to me because I emailed an employee on XXXX and he said that I should not have reached out to her outside of her work. I said well nobody would give me her work email, so I reached out on XXXX. He made some awful threats and nothing has happened to him. He still works there. XXXX XXXX got on the phone after I complained to the President of the bank. He said he was going to help me but he didn't even know anyone in the fraud dept. He was a complete XXXX to us and I have all of these people on speaker phone with some of my employees listening. Terrible people. Please return my money ASAP. They know my son has medical needs and I also have 5 financial products with Suntrust and deposit over 500k a year in these accounts and they are treating me like I am the thief. They are wrong and have no proof. They just do not want to refund me because the merchant will not refund them but they should have NEVER given my money away. Terrible."
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","Hello I have been disputing negative accounts on my credit report for a while now since XX/XX/2019 sending in my letters regarding the following negative accounts : XXXX XXXX- XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX and I have not received not one response from the agencies and I am aware that by law they have to give a response and they have 30 business days to respond and also correctly. As a consumer I am aware that under the Fair Credit Reporting Act any information that is incorrect, inaccurate and unverifiable is sufficient for removal."
Debt collection,ARRGON AGENCY INC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX is a result of identity theft. I recently discovered through my new monitoring service this account being reported I made efforts to remove this account from my file as the amount of {$92.00} does not belong to me. This account was fraudulently opened through this company in XXXX of 2018 an has been reported to the FTC and authorities as Identity theft. I have submitted all of my information needed to resolve this matter in this complaint and through the FTC report attached and do not feel comfortable giving any further information in any way to any others at this time due to the further possibilities of identity theft.
Mortgage,"Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) acquired my mortgage including servicing beginning on or about XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage was previously originated and serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX. At origination and at the time of the acquisition/servicing transfer to SLS, the loan was only escrowed for property taxes. It was not for insurance as the condominium master policies were provided at origination and were sufficient for closing. It is extremely important to note that my loan was originated without a requirement or condition for me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. 
On XX/XX/XXXX SLS claims to have sent me a first notice of expiration of a condominium unit owners policy. I never received the first notice from SLS. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS sent me a second notice which I did receive. Shortly thereafter I called and verbally spoke to SLS loan servicing department to inform them that my loan was originated without an HO-6 policy and that it was not required at origination. SLS was only able to respond that the HO-6 policy was required by law in Florida. I informed them that it was required in Florida in XXXX but an amendment was made to the Florida laws in XXXX in which the requirement was removed. The SLS representative did not take the time to consider the correct information I relayed to her and just kept saying that HO-6 insurance was required in Florida. I then called a second time to see if I could speak to a rationale person at SLS and again communicated to SLS that it erroneously was requiring me to have an HO-6 insurance policy. Again I explained to the representative that Florida laws were amended in XXXX and that any explicit requirement that condominiums must have an HO-6 policy was removed. Since the SLS representative continued to communicate to me that Florida law requires me to have an HO-6 policy, I specifically asked the representative to have SLS Legal send me evidence that Florida had such a requirement. The representative stated that someone would research and call me back. On XX/XX/XXXX a SLS representative named XXXX XXXX ( spelling may be wrong ) left me a voicemail requiring me again to have an HO-6 policy and to send evidence of an HO-6 policy. She also stated that it was Required by the State of Florida which is not correct. I have this voicemail saved as evidence that SLS gave me incorrect and misleading information. Although I requested it, SLS never provided me in writing any legal citation that I was required in the state of Florida to maintain an HO-6 insurance policy. On XX/XX/XXXX SLS force placed insurance costing {$5100.00} covering XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. This amount of force placed insurance impacted my monthly loan payment. My loan payment increased {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) from {$1600.00} to {$2900.00} based on an escrow analysis completed by SLS which was immediately enforced. Even though I did not have any prior damage to my property or any claims, they placed insurance retroactively for the entire year at an egregious cost of {$5100.00} when the market cost of HO-6 policies is approximately $ 600- {$700.00}. In XX/XX/XXXX SLS then renewed the forced placed HO-6 policy at an even higher cost of {$5600.00}. This new policy is a whopping 10 % higher than the prior policy which was force placed just 2 months prior. I ended up getting my own HO-6 policy for the sole purpose of reducing my required escrow amount and monthly payment to escrow until this issue was resolved and NOT because of any Florida requirement because one does not exist. My cost of getting an HO-6 policy was {$590.00}, approximately 89 % less than what SLS charged my escrow account.

In the end, I believe the actions of SLS violate the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which requires covered persons or service providers such as SLS to refrain from committing unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. SLS force placed an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan on the premise that it was required by Florida law as SLS representatives stated in a voicemail message which I saved and can provide. The citation of that law could not be provided by SLS when requested. Therefore it is contended that no such legal requirement exists for my loan. In addition, no such requirement was in place at the time of my loan origination and, therefore, no such requirement can arbitrarily be imposed on my loan by SLS at its leisure. As such, the act of SLS of incorrectly force placing an HO-6 insurance policy on my loan was an UNFAIR act in that 1 ) it caused me direct and substantial injury since my monthly payment immediately increase by {$1200.00} ( 77 % ) per month and I had to eventually get my own HO-6 policy which I was not required to obtain 2 ) it was not avoidable by me ; even though I attempted to resolve the matter with SLS prior to the force placement, SLS did not act appropriately and continued with the erroneous force placement ; furthermore, if I did not pay the increased escrow amount, then SLS would have reported negatively and incorrectly to the credit bureaus which would have created yet another regulatory violation ( of FCRA ) on their behalf 3 ) my financial injury was in no way outweigh by any benefit of having the HO-6 policy ; in fact, the first policy was retroactive 11 months from the date it was purchased ; since I had no events or claims during those 11 months then the benefit of the policy was solely for SLS, NOT the customer ; in addition, since the HO-6 policy is not a legal requirement, then I do not believe the benefits of the policy costing approximately 89 % more than the typical market price outweigh its costs.

The acts of SLS were also DECEPTIVE in that 1 ) I the consumer ( and potentially other consumers ) was mislead by SLS as an SLS personnel made an explicit Representation to me that the HO-6 policy was required by Florida law. I have subsequently consulted 2 separate law firms and both have informed me that Florida law was amended in XXXX and as a result there is no such explicit requirement that I have an HO-6 policy on my condominium ; furthermore, since I requested SLS to provide me evidence that a Florida requirement for the insurance existed and SLS did not provide evidence of such legal requirement, then SLS may have Omitted material information ; 2 ) since my loan was originated without the requirement of an HO-6 insurance policy and without the requirement to place funds in escrow for the purpose of purchasing an HO-6 policy, then my belief that an HO-6 policy was not required is reasonable 3 ) the misleading act by  SLS is material The acts of SLS were also ABUSIVE in that I that consumer placed reasonable reliance on SLS to act in my interest. However, SLS did not adequately perform its responsibilities in understanding Florida law and did not provide me with the evidence and citation of the Florida law SLS referred to in its voicemail probably because the requirement does not exist ; SLS was in a position to take advantage of me as I felt I did not have any other avenue to gain clarity on the matter and resolve it except for getting my own legal advice. 

Should this formal complaint not be resolved to a mutual satisfaction, I will have no choice but to proceed with formal legal action. I hope we can all come to an agreement."
Mortgage,"Borrower is requesting the help of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to assist him in having his mortgage company correct several accounting errors in their ledgers, that do not conform to the Loan Agreement Agreement. On XX/XX/XXXX, the Borrower, had a Mortgage loan held by Bank of America ( BOA ) with a beginning principal balance of {$430000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, BOA transferred the loan to XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  ( XXXX ) for servicing, which at that time of the transfer had a balance of {$420000.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX entered into a Loan Adjustment Agreement ( LAA ) with the Borrower. 
Shortly after receiving XXXX first monthly statement, Borrower noticed that the statement did not accurately reflect the terms of the LAA. Upon noticing the inaccuracies, Borrower contacted XXXX numerous times to ask them to correct their monthly statements to no avail. On XXXX XXXX, the loan was transferred back to Bank of America. Borrower also contacted BOA on numerous occasions to ask them to correct their ledger to no avail. 
Contrary to the LAA, XXXX reduced the original unpaid principal balance of {$420000.00} by only {$24000.00}, and therefore incorrectly calculated the new principal balance as {$400000.00}. Pursuant to the LAA, the original principal balance of {$420000.00} should have been reduced by {$27000.00}, and the new principal balance should have been correctly reflected on XXXX statements and ledger as {$400000.00}. 
Also, contrary to the LAA, XXXX statements indicate that XXXX added {$51000.00} to their incorrectly calculated new principal balance, and that XXXX intends that the {$51000.00} be paid as a balloon payment on the maturity date. But, according the LAA, interest should be waived on {$51000.00} of the XXXX XXXX, and if the Borrower fails to make timely payment on the final {$51000.00} of the principal, then the waived interest on the {$51000.00} becomes due as a balloon payment on the maturity date. 
Also, XXXX statements and ledger incorrectly show a 4.5 % interest rate on the loan, but the LAA clearly states that the interest rate on the loan is fixed at 3.5 % for the remaining life of the loan. 
Because of XXXX deviations from the LAA,  XXXX ledger shows that, for the 28 months that the loan was with XXXX, the original principal balance was reduced by {$24000.00} and that the Borrower made total principal payments of only {$8800.00} ; for a combined total reduction of the original principal of {$32000.00}. Therefore, at the time the loan was transferred back to BOA for servicing, XXXX miscalculated the principal balance as {$390000.00} instead of the actual {$370000.00}."

However, on XX/XX/2019 a massive overdraft was taking my account without further notification. I received a voicemail from XXXX stated that my account was overdraft to not further use. I contacted the branch manager, XXXX who was trying to help, but had no idea of what was going. He advised that the Chief Officer of SunTrust bank would be in contact with me. Its been a week later and no one really has any solution. Since I had recently filed for worker comps with my employer, I thought it was a check that was deposited in my account. Now my account is {$810.00} overdraft and no Suntrust managers know why the cause as my current employer check is being deposited funds in my account."

Student loan,"I have multiple loans through Sallie Mae which I was told could be consolidated when I was ready to repay them, I was later told that was impossible when it was being demanded of me to pay XXXX XXXX dollars a month. I was unable to finish my degree at XXXX XXXX university due to being unable to pay my tuition any longer. I transferred to a XXXX  college and continued to pay for school myself while working full-time and paying for all my living expenses on my own. I tried to make arrangements with Sallie Mae/Navient to pay my loans or defer them while I was in school. Needless to say I received numerous calls all hours of day, night, weekends, and even at my place of employment. I even contacted a lawyer to see if I could file harassment charges however I could not afford to do it. I was on the verge of tears every day. Here I am ten years later in more debt than you can imagine, still in school paying for it on my own, my loan is now defaulted due to Navient 's lack of willingness to work with me and my credit is forever ruined. I have written letters to everyone I could possibly think of for some kind of help, empathy, or compassion without any response. I am at my wit 's end and there is no way I can even imagine a way to pay my loans when they will not even consider lowering my payments. I was lied to the day I took out my loans and I am still being lied to now by this disgusting excuse of a company who prey on young adults trying to get ahead in life, all we end up with is debt and broken dreams."

I DISPUTE THIS ACCOUNT AND ITS ENTIRETY AND I KINDLY ASK THAT THIS ACCOUNT BE INVESTIGATED AND DELETED OFF MY CREDIT FILE."
Student loan,"I am beyond disappointed and frustrated that somewhere/somehow Sallie Mae ( now Navient ) managed to move my federal direct loans to the, "" private side '' of their operation. I worked with Sallie Mae in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX to set up a payment plan for my XXXX and XXXX student loans ( all Federal Direct and Stafford Loans ). As a new graduate entering the job market, I was counseled to consolidate my payment and take a "" level '' repayment plan. I distinctly recall that the person I spoke with on the phone telling me that the "" consolidation '' was just to allow me to make one payment. I was also locked in at 6 % for the life of the loan - and was told that Sallie Mae would not sell or transfer the loan. 
Fast forward to the present, I have been working for a qualified non-profit organization for the past 15 years, and qualify for the Federal Student Loan Forgiveness Program ; however, Navient has decided that my loans are now private. It was never made clear that any loan offered by Sallie Mae or Navient was not on behalf of the US Department of Education. I would never have "" consolidated '' my loan payment had I been made aware of forfeiting the benefits that could be offered down the road from the federal government. I applied for the FSLFP about 2 years ago, and was denied because Navient is claiming the loans are ineligible. This is predatory lending. I find it appalling that while I borrowed $ XXXX - after 14 years of paying $ XXXX/month, I still owe $ XXXX. By the time I have finished payments - I will have paid $ XXXX. Navient will have made {$41000.00} plus dollars to process my monthly payments. 
Will there be any additional changes to the FSLFP that may help people like me?"
"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I have never agreed to open a credit card named "" XXXX XXXX ''.

Mortgage,"Account # XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX I was alerted by my credit report monitoring service that my mortgage account payment with Keybank was reported for 30 days late. I checked my bank account for my online payment records and it was documented that my XX/XX/XXXX payment was sent to the mortgage payment processing company on XX/XX/XXXX as instructed. I attempted to log in to the mortgage payment processing company ( XXXX ) online to confirm receipt and was unable to access my account. I contacted Keybank the next day to inquire and was ultimately informed by the Customer Service Rep that the bank changed payment processing companies back in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX was no longer accepting payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. With the change in payment processing, the address for sending payments, along with the online site and customer service had been changed. I informed the customer service rep that I never received this change in companies or process, and I was still sending my mortgage payment to XXXX. I informed the rep that my XX/XX/XXXX payment had been sent automatically through online banking and the XXXX payment had just been sent today. The rep would not disclose what address that the notification of change in payment processing was sent to. When I finally logged into the new site for loan servicing I discovered that the mortgage company had the incorrect address on file ( I had not lived at that address in over 2 years ) and incorrect email address ( I had discontinued using that email address over 3 years ). I also discovered that this mortgage company had been charging me for late payment over the past couple years, indicated that they didn't receive my mortgage payment until the XXXX of each month. This is not accurate, because documentation from my online banking shows that the payments were received on the XXXX of each month, which is within the accepted time frame. Keybank was processing the payments based on when they received from the loan servicing provider, instead of when the loan servicing provider received them. 

I also attempted to pay my account online and was not able to add an account so I can make a payment. I contact the Keybank again on XX/XX/XXXX to resolve the issues with my account and request that they contact the credit bureaus for inaccurate reporting of 30 days late on my account. After waiting on hold for 30 mins, I was finally connected with a manager in Customer Services for Mortgages. When explaining the situation, the representative did not give me the impression that Keybank wanted to resolve the issue. She indicated that notices of the change in payment processing was sent out to a PO Box , but was unable to provide an exact address. She indicated that calls were made by the collections dept, but unable to confirm dates and time. She indicated that the address for mailing and phone number was confirmed by the previous mortgage payment processing company, XXXX. I then asked to speak with a manager and was put on hold again for another 15 minutes. 
After being on hold again, I advised I would call them back."

I have had most of my fraudulent withdrawals returned but what I am writing about is a transaction that occurred from my daughter 's custodial account in XXXX XXXX this transaction was one of many that occurred at the same time from different accounts. the amount of the withdrawal was {$2500.00}. Initially the amount was returned. I was notified that no additional action was needed on my part. The past few months I had to freeze ALL of my accounts. That account was already frozen after the above fraudulent activity occurred mid-XXXX. In having recurrent fraud I went back to scan all of my accounts, even the ones that were frozen and noticed by daughter 's balance was the {$2500.00} less than before. once I started investing I found and was then told that the funds had been taken back because I did not submit the required paperwork that has to be filled out within 60 days of the complaint. as mentioned above I had already been told no additional action was required at that time because they investigated and found the refund was appropriate. After finding out this new bit of information I asked next steps and I was told that it was resubmitted and I would have to wait until they heard back from the merchant, who is XXXX. I tried vehemently to explain that this was an error and to look at all the red flags on my account. They continued to regurgitate the policy so I waited. well I just received their response stating that after their research they state that the merchants received proof of my enrollment or documentation. This is completely false which is why I am admitting a formal complaint. Before receiving this letter I even wrote to corporate and did not receive one phone call, email or letter from corporate. I required a signature whenever the letter was received and someone did sign for it..again I have proof. I believe this may be internal. I have changed my online access so many times and have had instances where I would actually be talking to an agent and someone would be trying to log into my account real time. A few agents were baffled and was able to see that these logins were done from the same XXXX snf computer but could not see an IP address. I just want my daughter 's money back that we are saving for her college tuition and I plan on moving all of my accounts. This has been the only bank I have banked with and am so disappointed. I was hoping we could get these things resolved. I am a platinum member and was used to the bank so continued to try things their way to try to stop this activity. I have so many notes, documentation, names, dates that it is too much to scan and attach. but I can definitely provide all that when needed. I gave the XXXX County Sheriff 's department a sequence of events and they are investigating. A case number can be provided. I have a very descriptive email to the sherriff outlining the sequence of events including account numbers, names they used to open accounts, emails used, phone numbers attached and merchants/corporations they transferred money to. Dates with details listed included XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and it continued into XX/XX/XXXX. I just received an email 2 days ago about another attempt from an account that is frozen. although these accounts have been changed to new accounts. old accounts have been left open and frozen with negative balances so that activities my be tracked. all this being said to explain that it does not take a wise person to figure out that if all this has happened, the money taken from my daughter 's account is also fraudulent. it is not my fault that an agent told me that no further action was needed and bank of America 's excuse is that now they have to make a decision based off of the merchant. I have that letter attached. I can provide a plethora of documentation to support my complaint. I am a physician and the last thing I have time for is tracking my funds and being in constant communication with bank of America about my hard earned money that they just gave away to a criminal. they obviously do not have a secure system. it is definitely a inefficient system and too compartmentalized. I am disappointed."

The Vanilla company is not helpful and has repeatedly delayed and did nothing do anything about my complaint and has not sent the dispute form which meant that they can never start the investigation and return my money until they receive that form from me. Multiple attempts and long conversations with customer service agents prove that their process in resolving fraudulent charges is subpar and puts every gift card holders at risk for never receiving their money back. Vanilla gift cards does not protect consumers against these fraud charges even when the card has been registered online. Their process for fraudulent charge investigation is time-consuming, disorganized, no dedicated trained staff to handle situations like this, and does not send dispute form immediately to try to delay the investigation making it highly unfavorable to victims.

Credit card or prepaid card,"Best Buy Credit Services, Citi Bank. Morally Bankrupt? 

First off, I think it is safe to say a {$60.00} fee on {$500.00} line of credit is outrageous. I think this fee is purposely more than the minimum payment so Citi can accrue interest on it by spreading the payment out over multiple months for customers enrolled in autopay. 

In XXXX I purchased a laptop on the CC to help with online classes I was taking at the time.I made several other purchases over a 6 month time frame. 

In XX/XX/XXXX I paid an annual fee and asked for the account to be closed, the customer service rep convinced me to keep the account open, as a favor she would reduce the amount I owed. To paraphrase, she explained it was in my best interest to keep the account open since the fee was taken care of. Understanding that closing a credit card could harm my credit, I enrolled in auto pay at that time. 

In XX/XX/XXXX an automatic payment was applied to the account for the XXXX annual fee but not for the total amount, I switched banks between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The next month the payment failed. 

I have another account with Citi that I was current on this entire time. 
I called in late XXXX to close the account and I thought this brought me to a XXXX balance but apparently I was mistaken. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX my credit report reflects the account is closed by the creditor. Late payment of over 90 days balance of {$150.00} that Citi forgave and did not send to a collection agency. 

As a result my credit score was dinged about 80 points from around 705 to XXXX Citi employee XXXX of Best Buy Credit Services team # XXXX denies that it was predatory to offer to reduce my balance if I would consider keeping the card open in XXXX. Citi also denies that a {$60.00} fee for a {$500.00} line of credit is predatory because I could have requested a credit line increase at any time. Citi claims that as a young person I am a credit risk and thus a {$60.00} fee is justified."

"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports","I filed for bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX. I have endured the penalties of a low FICO score for the past 10 years, including high interest rates, high insurance rates and impacts to employment. I was looking forward to having the bankruptcy finally removed from my credit report and having a high score and low interest rates, but my score has barely moved since the bankruptcy dropped off my credit report. Today, according to Transunion my score is XXXX. 

I contacted TransUnion via Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on XX/XX/XXXX, but TransUnion refused to take responsibility for the FICO score they are providing to lenders, saying it is the fault of the individual lenders. Therefore, I am including XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX in my complaint that TransUnion and XXXX, a credit reporting company of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX, are artificially keeping my credit score low and continuing to punish me for my bankruptcy. ( Attached, please find snip 1 ) As mentioned earlier, there was no increase in points after the bankruptcy was dropped from the credit report. However, as shown in snip 2, Transunion and XXXX decreased my credit score by 36 points. 

Snip 3 shows the reason for the decrease in points is due to increase in debt. But as mentioned before, {$110000.00} is not due to personal loans, but to student loans, on a income driven repayment plan with XXXX. My monthly payment for this {$110000.00} is {$120.00}. 

The increase is debt is also not correct because it does not take payoffs into consideration. I took out a new car loan for {$13000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, after my 2016  XXXX XXXX was totaled in a car accident, which wasnt my fault. That means the loan for the XXXX was paid off, which is not included as a point increase. A debt consolidation loan taken out for {$7000.00} on XXXX that was completely paid off early on XX/XX/XXXX also was not shown as having positive points. There also seems to be some confusion about a car loan that I took out on XX/XX/XXXX. This loan was never actually funded. As you can see from the below clip, it was canceled the same day it was taken out. Therefore, this loan should not be a factor in my credit report score as shown by Snip 4 After submitting my complaint to TransUnion, I rechecked my XXXX account today, XX/XX/XXXX. It shows that my score increased by 2 points, because of debt reduction, but no other positive points, even though it shows that 3 recent inquires are no longer on my record, as shown by Snip 5 And somehow, since filing my complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, my credit score has now been dropped by 43 points, instead of 36 a week ago, as shown by Snip 6 How can a credit score drop by an additional 7 points when all I did was pay bills on time? ( Actually, Im not sure if the drop was by an additional 43 in a week. ) Perhaps the XXXX simulator can explain that. I used a XXXX tool called a simulator, in which you can enter different scenerios to see how it would impact my credit. Paying on time for 2 years, LOWERED my credit score by 14 points. Please see Snips 7 and 8. 

If paying on time lowers a persons credit score by 14 points, which is a positive thing, one must consider that XXXX and XXXX XXXX are artificially keeping my credit score low. 

As I stated in my previous complaint, over the past 10 years, I have had two late payments, which were due to a debt consolidation loan in XX/XX/XXXX. TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX XXXX do not consider having a good repayment history is a good thing. I would think that only having two late payments in 10 years, after filing for bankruptcy shows character and a willingness to make sure their credit improved. And yet, TransUnion, XXXX and XXXX XXXX are not acknowledging any positive steps I have made to improve my credit."

Mortgage,"I closed on a home I owned in Ohio on XX/XX/20.

I received a payoff letter from Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and had it sent to the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was told not to make any more mortgage payments because I was scheduled to close on XX/XX/20. The day of closing my mortgage was not paid even though the buyer was given keys to my home and had moved in and started remodeling before I received a dime for payoff of my mortgage. My mortgage remained unpaid until XX/XX/XXXX because the weekend passed before I was told that the funds from the buyers loan was sent to the wrong Title Company. HOW??

On XX/XX/XXXX my credit score dropped by 87 points from XXXX to XXXX with XXXX  and I learned today that my credit score dropped 93 points with XXXX   from XXXX to XXXX. Now I want to know how someone who's never been late before on any bills can now have my credit score crushed after paying off a mortgage and paying down revolving debit by approx. {$14000.00}.

I fell behind on the mortgage. 

Since then, I have been asking to have my loan reinstated and put the past unpaid payments on the back of my loan. I have had a mediation with Bank of Americas Attorney. I have submitted the documents they are asking only to find out that Bank of America was not reviewing the documents. And after I kept calling Bank of America, I was told by Customer Relations that an underwriter kept denying my loan stating that my income could not be verified. They are not telling the truth because Im on XXXX and they have a copy of my awards letter. I was also told that the underwriter stopped reviewing my loan because he/she they questioned my XX/XX/XXXX taxes. Im having concerns about that because I have never been audited by IRS and the underwriter has never asked for an explanation.
